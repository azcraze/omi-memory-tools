Hostile or Negative Language: - "anger" - "dying" - "broken" - "vigilante violence"  Suggestions for Respectful and Constructive Communication: 1. Focus on solutions rather than problems. Instead of highlighting anger or dying, discuss actionable steps that can be taken to improve the situation. 2. Use inclusive language to foster understanding. Avoid terms that can create division, such as "the people on top" or "rich billionaires." 3. Encourage open dialogue without resorting to extreme language. Phrases like "vigilante violence" can escalate tensions; instead, discuss peaceful advocacy.  Appropriate Alternatives: - Instead of "anger," use "concerns" or "frustrations." - Replace "dying" with "experiencing health disparities." - Change "broken" to "challenging" or "needing reform." - Instead of "vigilante violence," consider "taking peaceful action" or "advocating for change."  By using more constructive language, the conversation can promote understanding and collaboration.
