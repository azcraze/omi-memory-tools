Speaker 1: So I don't wanna just, like, ignore that and act like I don't notice by the way. And even, like, I was talking about we're talking about last night. Like, I don't know. It was something I was, like, expecting the same old, like, first to, like, the end of the cereal and the bell, and then it being a thing where I was attacking you for it. Are you not happy or for you  Speaker 4: having,  Speaker 1: like,  Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of what are  Speaker 1: Oh, we were talking about gender roles? Basically, or the not all men thing. And I was explaining that, but we were both just talking about, like, know, what you like, what you didn't know or understand about it and stuff like that. It's just like pretty  Speaker 3: much.  Speaker 1: And you didn't take it personally, which is really good don't know why you would.  User: Because we're gonna all men men. Or man guy. Not that you say that. But  Speaker 2: I I'm the not all men man that they're referring to when they say not all men. No. No. No.  Speaker 1: No.  Speaker 4: No. Yes. Kind of. I I still don't fucking  Speaker 2: understand that fucking  Speaker 5: It's a stupid  Speaker 1: thing. And and people will say that. They usually  Speaker 3: think  Speaker 1: stupid. They're  Speaker 2: not a  Speaker 1: problem, but  Speaker 2: When you when you use it for, like, when you use it, like, as a different examples of, you know, not all fucking notable cultural racist type shit. Like, I understood it then. Yeah. But, like,  Speaker 4: in  Speaker 2: his argument, I just didn't I didn't  Speaker 1: Yeah. His argument didn't make meme shit at all, but alone, like, on its own, this is an argument that people used to make this point. He was not making that point very well. At all using it. By using it, I don't he farted again, him trying to use  Speaker 5: it  Speaker 4: And then other things you said didn't actually  Speaker 1: go along with what along with that idea necessarily at all. Because, like, it's a no shit, no, I'm in, but he never argued for, like, as to why that would mean that the issue isn't addressed to still  User: I don't know. But  Speaker 4: Mhmm.  Speaker 1: Just in  User: general, like,  Speaker 1: sort of about race. I mean, we did you did at first, it was not good. The talking the rice conversation about whatever. At first, it was not good. It it evolved into the same. Same kind of, like,  Speaker 3: thing.  Speaker 1: Yeah. And, you know, and and even, like, LGBTQ plus stuff, things like that. So, like, remember on New Year's last year, you were like, I don't know. Something about being not about trans people. And I was like, you're not allowed to be anti trans. Yeah. I mean, we didn't necessarily fight about it, but yeah. So what  User: do you think?  Speaker 1: Like, what else what am I not mentioning that you that you actually have been that you know you've consciously been doing  User: Like, I mean, I do know that you're trying for sure. I know that you want to.  Speaker 4: Make  Speaker 1: it  Speaker 4: work.  Speaker 2: Like, I just I don't know if fucking like, things that, like, I've been doing,  Speaker 1: I don't know. Just do you have what do you have to say to that? I guess, do you have anything to say? To  Speaker 2: that? I'm I'm glad that you noticed that, like, I'm I'm trying and that, like, I'm being more receptive instead of, like, combative towards new ideas and shit. Am I seeing things for, like, what they actually are and not just, like, that are shitty way they've been explained to me?  Speaker 3: Yeah.  Speaker 1: I feel like that sort of sounds bad because  User: not what you said.  Speaker 1: But I feel, like, bad because I'm, like, I mean, it's not like that I'm trying to  User: make you like, as if, like, that what you think now is wrong and what I say is correct. So you should like, not for that, like, really, it's  Speaker 2: No. But you  Speaker 1: I guess it's like just engaging in critical thought.  Speaker 2: Yes. The question why. And,  Speaker 4: like, when  Speaker 2: it comes down to it, I don't have a fuck fucking reason for half the shit I fucking think. And, like, if you give me a y, you'd blessing my fucking game. For real? I I I don't have much to say about because I it's like information overload to begin with.  Speaker 1: Yes. I'm sorry. I  Speaker 4: got  Speaker 1: that is true. And,  Speaker 2: like, I just need a I need, like, a little bit of time to, like, Digest. You know?  Speaker 1: Mhmm. No. I I know that, actually.  User: So then I wanna talk about Don't be I don't like I'm not trying to attack you or anything like that or bring up or rehash, like, all our I just want you to, like,  Speaker 1: realize the pattern  User: and tell me, like, what  Speaker 1: Well, I think there's a reason why you do it. And I think we just need to figure out that reason and work through it. But  User: dismissing Like, dismissing me. I mean, maybe it's just like a  Speaker 1: cultural thing, like, as in just we're not supposed to be taken seriously because we're just openly emotional women. I don't think that's the case. I hope not. I hope that's not the case, but there's a reason that you just dismiss my like, everything I'm saying  User: or anything I'm saying that I have an issue with.  Speaker 2: Well,  Speaker 4: like,  Speaker 2: Right right out the gate is what you just said. Like, it's not don't have, like, an automatic dismissal just because you female or anything like that.  Speaker 4: I  Speaker 2: I like I said, my mom was the breadwinner and the fucking housekeeper. In my family. So, like, I truly respect the fucking the feminine form, and I'm not just gonna oh, she's talking again?  Speaker 4: No.  User: It's it's  Speaker 2: wonderful. How how cute. No. Like, I mean  Speaker 1: That's not what I'm talking about,  Speaker 2: though. No. But, like, that's that's, like, the extreme case of dismissal. It's like, oh, you're talking that's cute. You know? No. I I don't ever think no shit anywhere near like that  Speaker 4: I know. But I think I think  Speaker 2: I think we're news. You're addressing is me saying, like, you're getting mad over nothing. It's  Speaker 4: the the  Speaker 2: what I mean when I say that, it's like, it's like okay. The the topic is whatever the topic is. I can't think of a specific example right now. But, like, that topic as far as you and I and our relationship and how we conduct ourselves that topic has literally nothing to do with the way me and you see each other and that's why I say, like, you know, it's like, why are you getting why why why are you getting so fucking mad over this that, like, doesn't truly affect  Speaker 4: the situation? Point  Speaker 1: when you do that, it's not even about the thing anymore. It's the fact that you get defensive about  Speaker 3: it.  Speaker 1: And that you don't legitimize, like,  User: me having any kind of, like,  Speaker 1: concern with it that I'm trying to address with you and what you said So it's a thing  User: of, like,  Speaker 1: well, what do you think it does when you say like, what does it mean when you say that? Why do you say that? If it's not because you want to stop the conversation? And because it's something I shouldn't be worrying about or you shouldn't care about  Speaker 2: or No. I'm I'm I'm saying it should it's not something that me  Speaker 4: and you  Speaker 2: should be fighting about.  Speaker 4: I know. So when you say that  Speaker 2: saying that not saying that it's something that you shouldn't care about. Because, like  Speaker 1: But that's all I'm trying to do is address it. I'm not trying to fight about it  User: either.  Speaker 3: If  Speaker 1: anything,  User: It shouldn't be a big deal. You're correct. So I don't understand why having the having the talk makes you defensive.  Speaker 1: You're right. It's not a big deal. But the fact  User: we're fighting about it is because there was something you got defensive about.  Speaker 2: Typically, like, when I get defensive, it's because I feel like you know, I mean, offensive. Like, when when you, like,  Speaker 0: Immediately, when you say something with attitude or tone, then I'm just like, why the attitude? Why the tone? Like, why the face? I always do it, right, when you say it. So why don't you do it then?  Speaker 1: I don't know. Because, like, I have tried to do that before. I have tried to say that you're, like, coming at me with, like,  Speaker 0: No. You don't. You do not say it immediately when I do it. You don't.  Speaker 1: I I have I have at least once before. At  Speaker 0: least once?  Speaker 1: I'm just saying, like, I can't put a number on it, but I know that I've And, like, it didn't necessarily go over well.  Speaker 0: I don't know what you're talking about. I don't remember this. I think where  Speaker 1: you said this to me and I was already mad, that doesn't that's not the same thing. Of course, if I already mad because I tried to address something very simply with you that like, I don't understand why was something you got defensive about or, like, Socket. I mean, just, like, I don't know. I mean, You can't, like, expect me to be, like, calm and everything after, like, we've just ended up in a fight about something that shouldn't have been a fight, and then I don't know why you get defensive about in the first place.  Speaker 2: The the best the best response to the best answer from my defensiveness is, like, 5 I feel like I feel offended. I can't fucking pinpoint why with a specific example or anything  Speaker 1: Okay.  Speaker 2: But, like  Speaker 1: Well, not not that hot. It's just you just been you dismissing me. In what I'm talking about. But, yes.  Speaker 2: Right. It's not I don't I don't ever try to dismiss what you're saying because I value your opinions and shit. The thing that I, like, try and fucking that you're calling me dismissing your feelings and everything is like, just the fight in general itself. It's like, Wait. That's the only thing that, like, I'm trying to, like, fucking get out of.  Speaker 1: We're not fighting at that point. We're not fighting because of what I said what I brought up initially at all. What we're fighting about is the fact that you don't care about what I'm saying and that you've dismissed me. That is what we're fighting about. And that you never you you get mad about, like, nothing. You're getting mad over anything. It's not even a big deal. Why do you wanna fight about this? Something like that. Like, I'm not even trying to fight with you. That kind of thing is dismissing Me caring about something that is simple enough, I think possibly or could be, but because you don't want to, like, because you don't wanna talk about it, you just dismiss anything. Like, you dismiss me like, once by just, like, not understanding your saying, like, that you're confused or whatever, but  Speaker 2: How how is that a dismissal? Like, if I if I was genuinely don't understand something, it's not me dismissing  Speaker 1: Well, because saying that does nothing but end the in progress. It does nothing to move it forward.  Speaker 2: I I would think that you study in my confusion would  Speaker 1: How do I know what you're confused about? Shouldn't you seek to ask questions to be sorry. I didn't mean to take off.  Speaker 2: Right. When you told me that I'm confused, it means that like, I'm not I'm not following the same path in your words that you're intending because, like, if I I we verified understood what you were saying, you'd be, like, on the same path as far as, like, the conversation goes. But, like, you're saying something and, like, I just don't follow, and I'm like, fucking wait. Wait. What? Like, I I missed something or whatever, and I'm confused. Like, me stating that I'm confused. This is me saying okay. Stop talking?  Speaker 1: I didn't say you're telling me to shut up, but you're telling me basic by just Saying that and not adding anything else is not you seeking to understand or care about understanding anything You saying that I could literally not say anything else to that because I don't know what your confused about. I don't know what to say. And you literally wouldn't continue. You wouldn't seek clarification on what you're confused about. It would just be the end of the conversation. And also, like but regardless, the part the the actual things I'm it's hard. I'm I am, like, really talking about or whenever you say that I'm making a big deal out of nothing or that I'm getting mad over nothing or that, like, why are you so angry? Like, that kind of thing. It I mean, it doesn't have to mean that I'm actually upset, It could be any emotion that I'm feeling, and it's not a big deal, like, is the most is the more common one that's, like, really infuriating and really dismissive. Because when you say it's not a big deal, I know I know you're not saying you're not explicitly saying what emotion I'm feeling, It doesn't matter, like it doesn't matter, like about the emotion you're saying that I I'm Like, expressing. What matters to me is that whatever emotion I am expressing you think is too much and that it's not warranted. And that  Speaker 2: basically  Speaker 1: Like, any kind of deal that I'm making out of it or wanting to, like, like, address about it is  User: an overreaction  Speaker 1: So, I mean, what do you what do you think I understand when you say that? I don't ever say that to you. I never say that to you.  User: Wait. You didn't answer my  Speaker 2: question? I I  Speaker 1: want you to answer my question because I want to know that you actually understand me. Please. Speaker 2: What what do you interpret by me saying that? Speaker 1: Yes. What does it  Speaker 2: mean  Speaker 3: to me when you say it? To me.  Speaker 1: Yes.  Speaker 2: Like, whenever I say that it doesn't mean you're overreacting them.  Speaker 1: Or something along those lines. Right?  Speaker 3: Basically saying  Speaker 2: the fucking There's level of emotion evoked at the moment is too much for the situation or the thought or, like, the happening or whatever the fuck word is best right now. But bottom line is, like, like I said, you know, to does dismiss you because I'm basically saying that fucking your emotions are unwarranted. And I I I get that now.  User: So I mean, I wanted you to understand, like, that part. Like, for sure that like, I wanted you to come to like a understanding about whether whether or not  Speaker 1: you understand that that is actually dismissing me. And telling me that it's not whatever it is that I'm upset about is or that I'm having any kind of emotion over because it doesn't matter, like, that you whether or not you have the emotion correct. It's just the  User: dismissing of me caring about it But  Speaker 1: You said it right? Okay. You said  User: acknowledge it. So, basically, we agree that you don't say that to me.  Speaker 3: Anymore.  Speaker 1: Or anything like that.  User: Ever even even this, like,  Speaker 1: and then don't tell me you're confused. Ask don't just tell me you're confused because it's kind of along the same lines in a way because I mean, of course, I'm not trying to confuse you, but Because I Like, if you just if it's just a blanket, I'm confused. I don't know where to start. Like, I'm like, okay. At what point did you become confused? Which part are you confused about? Like, I don't know. Like, me, I feel like you're saying that and not giving me, like, specifics on where I should clarify tells me that you don't care enough to, like, actually figure it out. You're not not, like, like, I want you to engage in the conversation and, like, ask me questions. Or but the but in reality, actually, you don't just say it in, like, you don't just say it at times where you just may be confused.  User: There are certain times you say this. Speaker 1: And you say this whenever I'm trying to express something that I have an issue with. Like and I'm trying to explain, but you've already tried to, like, defend your position or what you did or, like, how you think or what somebody else  Speaker 4: said that is  User: your friend,  Speaker 3: I  Speaker 1: don't know, or the way that they act or something. So Like, when you say it. Whenever I'm trying to explain or whenever we have, like, a  User: like I don't know. Speaker 1: It's just something that  Speaker 2: you do. Example  Speaker 3: in your  Speaker 2: mind  Speaker 1: Yeah. I mean, you say this a lot, actually,  Speaker 3: but  Speaker 1: specifically, whenever I was trying to explain I think, This is Nathaniel and how, like, I forgot, like, what what it was that day. But he didn't, like, he was calling you and you wanted I don't know. I don't remember what it was that he talked to you about that time. But I was trying to basically, I was trying to tell you that, like, something along the lines of you giving him too much credit. Or you being, like, not get oh, I know what it was. Oh, my god. It was It was beautiful, my This was this is after he did everything that he did to  Speaker 3: you. Speaker 1: Everything. Oh, and I fucking sold you and You sold him and you didn't charge him or you didn't charge him for that much, or he thought it was gonna be more. Something like that, something along those  Speaker 3: lines. Speaker 1: And I was just like, Wait. Why, like, why don't you just charge him more or something like that? Like, why would you not? Like, not  Speaker 3: like  Speaker 1: like he has the money for it, and I think maybe I don't remember exactly what the disagreement was really, but, like, I was like, well, I mean, you know he has the money for it because like, come on, like, where he lives. And I just  Speaker 4: I  User: don't  Speaker 3: know. Speaker 1: And if he's the one who said that You thought it was a low, like, that you're charging him a little. I don't know what it  Speaker 2: was. He's he's never said anything about the Quantity, by  Speaker 3: No.  Speaker 1: Not the quantity that you were charging him less than what he thought he would be charged. What you use? Usually charge or something like that. Or maybe it was, like, he was gonna pay extra 4 he  Speaker 3: gave  Speaker 2: me extra for fucking showing up Wait. Or whatever.  Speaker 1: Yeah. There you go. Something like  Speaker 4: that. Speaker 1: Yeah. Something like  Speaker 3: that. He's  Speaker 2: never  Speaker 1: It was something along it was something along the lines of him doing him saying something about paying you more and you not you not are you either saying it wasn't necessary. I think it was just that you said it wasn't necessary or something like that. And I was like, why not? Like, you're taking a lot of risk. You already don't sell to people, like, especially people who can afford you know? So that was, like, me having that is a concern of mine. It is, you know, But, like, but you got defensive about it. And so that and then it quickly like it after I, like after just a couple back and forth about like me saying that, like, why don't you charge? Like, why would you not accept it? Why is it something, like, like he doesn't care about you. He owes you a shit load of money. If anything at all already. Like, don't, like, I mean, you're too, like, you give him too much credit for being a person who cares about you at all. I don't know, like, why don't know. It just it would hurt him, I would not I would say not to do it. Of course, like I don't think you should hurt anybody. But I don't think it will hurt him. So I don't so I don't see like why this person who took advantage of you and treated you so poorly. You should get any kind of, like, Any of your, like, grace in anything and  Speaker 5: Mhmm. Speaker 1: Or even benefit  Speaker 4: the  Speaker 1: doubt. But I think it was more I don't even think it was more that like you cared so much about me saying something negative about him as you getting defensive because it was somebody  Speaker 3: you  Speaker 1: know or  Speaker 3: whatever. Speaker 5: Me  Speaker 4: about  Speaker 2: my business. I think that's what I actually got, like, upset about. It was, like, I I took it, like, fucking you telling me how to do my business  Speaker 4: Wait.  Speaker 1: Okay. Well, then that's a different issue also, though. So but it is still along the lines of dismissing a dismissing me because oh, but part where you said basically, you just we're like, I'm so confused. And so then I just gave up. I was just I was pissed off at that point because when you said that, I'm just like, okay. But you're not gonna, like, try and be not confused, like, I don't know what you're confused about. Really? I didn't know that if that were the case that you had an issue with that, but Right. Why should like, why would you have that those kinds of thoughts? Like, about you know, like, I sat here and waited for you, like, for how right? Like No. I'm So I don't  Speaker 3: know  Speaker 1: how  Speaker 3: you could  Speaker 1: say that it's  Speaker 3: not,  Speaker 1: like, my place to tell you anything or care about that kind of stuff. Speaker 2: No. Like, it it's not you, like, at all. It's it's me fucking because I've I've always conducted my business, like, on my own. Like, I've I used to fucking partner up with fucking Jared and shit when we were, like, living together, but, like, I I do not play well with others when it comes to, like, business. And  Speaker 1: my other other  Speaker 2: Nope. They they they just hear hear me out,  Speaker 1: please. But don't over but  Speaker 2: I'm not I'm not explain  Speaker 1: yourself. Like, if it's then it's wrong. Okay. I just want you to know that. I want you to at least  Speaker 2: I I admit that it is wrong for me to fucking, like, Not be receptive to your ideas when it comes to, like, my extracurriculars. Speaker 5: Fucking because you give fucking solid advice and fucking you're a fucking very smart fucking person, and I respect the fuck out of your brain. So, like, when it  Speaker 1: It's not just the fact that you It's not just the fact that you  Speaker 5: It affects both of us  Speaker 2: But, like, that being said, the reason why I get, like, upset when I feel like I'm being told how to how to run my business  Speaker 5: is because, like, I've always done it myself. So, like, having somebody who I'm but I'm partnered with in every way it accept that. You know what I mean? Because, like, it's not like it's not like you're going in with me and fucking word  Speaker 3: Yeah. Speaker 2: No.  Speaker 1: They're  Speaker 3: good. Speaker 2: It's In that respect, it's still it's still my business or whatever. But, like, in every other facet of my life, Speaker 5: It's how it's  Speaker 2: our business, so to speak. So, like, your  Speaker 5: opinion should weigh just as heavily in the household as in with my business because I respect you to that fucking level but I'm just not used to fucking having that respect for somebody and have having to be 100% completely across the board, so there's no questions asked, like, and that was the wrong way to fucking phrase that. Speaker 3: But  Speaker 2: because I respect you I respect your opinions, like, regardless of the fucking topic. But it's just like hearing it was it it just isn't it's not  Speaker 5: easy being  Speaker 2: Like, told a better way to do things or a way that I should do things when  Speaker 5: I've always made those executive decisions, it's like, myself with no input from anybody  Speaker 2: else. Speaker 1: Oh, I wasn't telling you how you should or shouldn't do anything. I was telling you how I feel about it because it affects me. Speaker 4: No. Speaker 2: But, like, do do you understand how I could take it as No. Speaker 1: Because I'm telling you right now, like, I mean, you explaining it to me. I understood you took it away a certain way that shouldn't have been taken a certain way. But my point is, you can't explain it to me in a way where I can accept the answer. I understand that you thought wrongly and you had the wrong mindset about it and you didn't put yourself in my shoes. I understand that. What I'm trying to get from you is for you to acknowledge that you didn't do that, and that's what you should have done. And then you maybe would have, like,  Speaker 2: Is  Speaker 1: that  Speaker 2: is that not what I did before I even started to explain myself? Speaker 1: Well, no. Because I don't understand why you explained yourself. Like, I don't understand.  Speaker 3: Because  Speaker 1: I'm trying to try to bring my own fucking house, like, in that  Speaker 3: moment. Speaker 1: One told you. That, like, I was just gonna fucking throw the fuck out. 2, like, when it was addressed, I should've fucking just  Speaker 3: you  Speaker 1: know, fucking, you know, I acknowledge, you know, some of your feelings and  Speaker 4: yeah,  Speaker 1: like, I apologize for fucking not telling you. Like, that should have been my response, not fucking that, like, I don't know if they're fucking get defensive about this shit because I've yet every fucking writer to be  Speaker 2: upset. I mean, I wasn't really even that upset. I mean, that's fine. I just wanted you to tell me that. Like, but yeah. Good.  Speaker 4: Okay.  Speaker 5: So are you going to show the fuck out  Speaker 2: about This is after we were just silent for, like, over a minute and not say anything, actually. I just said, okay, fun.  Speaker 4: You  Speaker 6: fucking  Speaker 2: the  Speaker 1: whole thing that we're working out about.  Speaker 7: I didn't fucking knew. I don't even know why the fuck we got to this level in the first place.  Speaker 5: Well, you went to go chill out.  Speaker 2: What did you do?  Speaker 7: Yeah. What  Speaker 5: do you mean?  Speaker 7: Situation, dude, the fucking  Speaker 5: Uh-huh. Because you went to go chill out. Right? Isn't that what that means?  Speaker 3: I  Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. That's another thing that oh my god, dude. Like, whenever I'm trying to get you to just answer a question or, like, like,  Speaker 1: the  Speaker 2: the hoops were jumping through to try and say that you were not mad even after you just told me that you were gone longer than you said or whatever because you were mad. You were chilling out. I don't understand it. Like, I don't understand why. I mean and then, also, like, you said you need to chill out, but then I mean, I mean, is is that not what you were communicating to me? Was that, like, by saying you were going to chill out that you were upset about something or whatever, you had something to think about. And the fact that you were there for so long saying saying that you were chilling out, I was thinking that meant that you were you had something that you were trying to, like, You know? I wanted to express like, I wanted to talk about it. That we could so I could understand what you mad about in this situation so that we could talk about it. You know? But you just were, like, insistent now after saying that you were chilling out, insistent that you weren't even mad. And I don't understand how Like, I don't understand what to do in that situation because I'm, like, literally trying to tell you you're you're going you're contradicting yourself and I don't know why. But then they get to you more upset to the point where it's just you throw your hands up and your head back and just, oh my god, dude. As if, like,  User: I am being crazy.  Speaker 2: And I know I'm not saying that you say that, but that's what that means to me. That is what that means. I mean, I'm not asking you to like, explain yourself as if, like, not trying to I don't expect you to just explain yourself and, like, give me any kind of,  Speaker 4: like,  Speaker 2: reason or justification or anything like that to explain yourself like that. Mean, I know and I know you know, that it's wrong and that it's not right and that it is confusing and it is like, it's frustrating, and it doesn't help anything, and you're just Refusing to take accountability for, like, You know? Like, when you're doing when you do that, you're deflecting But I I know you know it's not right and it's wrong. I just want you to tell me that you realize what I'm saying when I say that you do this so that we can work on figuring out how to make sure that this doesn't happen and that you acknowledge maybe what I'm pointing out that you are it or something. Right? Or is it am I wrong? About what I'm  Speaker 3: hearing? Speaker 1: Right.  Speaker 6: I  Speaker 5: are you right? Your name is so fucking difficult. How  Speaker 7: the fuck am I making you difficult?  Speaker 5: Because  Speaker 3: you  Speaker 5: Walked away because you needed to go chill out  Speaker 2: or whatever. They had  Speaker 7: a problem. I know. Because you were upset about some  Speaker 6: Oh my  Speaker 7: god. What the fuck do I even have to be upset about? So  Speaker 8: why did you need to go to school out?  Speaker 5: Okay. So now it's me needing to chill out, but you needed to be away.  Speaker 8: Okay.  Speaker 2: Alright. If I if I'm just  Speaker 5: like that frustratingly, like, stupid to you or whatever the fuck, like, that I  Speaker 8: You doing what you're doing to me  Speaker 5: We got oh my god. Like, I'm just so fucking, like, I should be getting what you're saying, and I just can't get it. What do you think that means to me?  Speaker 7: What do you think it means to  Speaker 4: me?  Speaker 7: Why do you fucking own something?  Speaker 2: Like, like, that was 3 times in a row. Every one of the responses you gave to what I said was you  Speaker 0: I mean, but I want you to tell me, like, if I'm, like, not like, if I'm being if there's something I'm not seeing that I'm doing or that I'm being inconsistent about, I mean, I mean, I try to say what I mean when I'm upset, and I'm like, I don't know. But I don't tell you things that, like, I don't mean.  Speaker 1: asshole. But that's generic in the. But I'm saying, like, things like But, like, just you will never, like, accept accountability, I guess. I don't know if that's the right word, but it's blaming it's blame shifting. For sure. Just it's never I mean, It's it just will never like, you never address, like, what I'm saying. I mean, a lot of times, I guess. A lot a lot of times in those situations, And you ignored the things you just like, just said.  Speaker 0: That there was something to like, I I don't know. I can't I can't I'm not inside your head, but I do know that, like, it's not it's not like a It's just a deduction. It's you know what? So you're not in him. And then it leads to, like, raging Like, that's what leads to, like, the raging, like, madness between us. most of the time, it's I fucking apologize, and that's not genuine whatsoever. And that's not telling me that you hear It's not like to me, accountability or just telling me that you understand me or that you Yeah. Is just being humble and being like, you know, being gentle about it and just saying, like, or I mean, one way anyways Just saying, like, okay, or something like that, and I'm sorry, or just tell you that you understand. What I'm saying the issue is most of the things that we fight about whenever we're fighting, though, is, like, literally the what? Don't know. I say the same thing a lot just that you don't care about what I my feelings or what I'm trying to say. You don't seek to understand me. From  Speaker 0: And I just, like, almost forgot because that you by saying that, okay, yes, you admitted that you were but by saying that, you dismissed everything I was trying to address, which was the fact that you were not answering. You were that you of what you were doing. That was not cool at all because at that point, I was like, I don't want you to say it now. I knew you were mad the whole time. That's not the point I'm making. My point is that the fight that we got into was over the fact that you didn't want to just admit that you were upset about something. Oh, Actually, I don't remember. I think this might have been I don't know if this is the same night that we got up they we were upset with like, we were fighting already. Because of the same example about Daniel the Daniel thing. Or if this was I don't remember for sure, but if this is the thing about New Year's and going to, going to with his face is and me feeling like he didn't care to understand me, then But was a a what's this? Keith Keith? I don't even know. Sorry. I didn't think that now. I'm not like I don't want you to, like, answer to your behavior like that. I just want to know that you see what I'm saying or that or tell me where I'm missing something or where, like, I'm wrong or some I don't know. Or I  Speaker 1: know. We just got home so far.  User: But also, do you know how much you do this to me?  Speaker 1: Since you got the recorder, kind of  User: That mean, it's  Speaker 2: just because I feel like in order for us to get through it, I don't have to, like, it has to be ducking in it so that you can see. And then you can watch it. Make changes. You know?  Speaker 1: Mhmm.  Speaker 2: I'm not trying to use this against you at all. Like, at all. I want it's a 6 I have I've I just have this little bit on this page, then I have all of this So Granted, this part is just more like the resolution ish But Okay. I'll finish this pitch that I think that we should, like, have some time for, like,  User: to digest in a way.  Speaker 2: Against And think about, like, Right. I don't want you to beat yourself up about it at all. I don't Well, something you should do because it should be more about me. And how are you gonna do better for us. Doing  Speaker 1: that  Speaker 2: doesn't help anything, but  Speaker 1: that is a thought that's in my head. But at the same time, it fucking sucks having everything be your fucking call.  User: I mean, it's not like it's not the  Speaker 1: I just laid on so fucking thick. Like, that's I'm not saying that that's your message or your intention but that's how I feel.  Speaker 2: I'm not trying to do that. I know that that was what I was gonna isn't it all stems just from the same thing, though.  Speaker 1: So  Speaker 2: it's all kinda related. Hopefully, just  Speaker 1: It's  Speaker 2: not like I'm trying to save 10 I'm trying to get better.  Speaker 1: I understand that. Like I know that you're not trying for them. Fucking basically is.  Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Speaker 1: I  Speaker 2: just want to work through it. And do what we need to do to k. Well, I don't wanna, like, keep laying on. And then there's not too much more of that at all, but there's more. Well, we will come back to it. What? I  Speaker 1: Number 2. My teddy bear.  Speaker 0: Let me continue this  Speaker 1: K. Mhmm. Let me see right now then. I  Speaker 0: mean, I just it doesn't matter what we what else we do or what whatever we do tonight is the nothing. It's for both of us. K.  Speaker 1: But smells in there. Oh,  User: yeah.  Speaker 1: How many sleeves are do you have?  User: 3. Only  Speaker 1: 2  User: of them, my wife. And that one's the jacket because of the half sleeve of quarter wait. 3 quarter sleeve. A little bit.  Speaker 1: And  User: that one's like  Speaker 2: a quarter  User: body. Exactly.  Speaker 2: Originally, you only had 1 jean jacket. You just made  Speaker 1: them.  Speaker 1: Hello? Uh-oh. My nose. Oh, studies.  Speaker 2: Look. So turn off the light.  User: Mylee Johnson.  Speaker 2: When we're doing it, then bear with the lighter.  User: Okay. Turned on. Mhmm. Oh,  Speaker 1: yeah. Let's  Speaker 2: do it. Well,  User: or when I can feel your pastkin. Really hard.  Speaker 1: Feeling  User: it dancing.  Speaker 1: And  User: then,  Speaker 2: deliver  Speaker 1: me.  Speaker 2: And  User: then, like,  Speaker 1: the sound and the  User: way it feels when you breathe in my ear  Speaker 1: and my neck.

Now I want you to think about that. When you say many, you just told me what you meant. See, I know what many means. If you wanted to tell me that you had one black friend, which I might have believed, you would have said, a, Not many. If you wanted to tell me that you had 2 black friends, which I maybe You would have said a couple, not many. If you wanted to tell me you had 3 black friends, but now I really start to think You would have said a few. So when you said you have many, you just said you have 4 or more black friends each. Keep in mind the numbers. 100 and  Speaker 1: there were only 35,000,000 black people to go around that year. Friends. But more importantly, even if every one of us was telling the truth, it wouldn't matter, would it? What does that mean that the color have to do with whether or not you might be free racially biased? See, we act like somehow that's a get out of jail free card. That we can't be racist, that we have racist, we can't have the logic of that. We have that makes no damn sense at all. Is there, like, no. And I doubted any of you would not. It is a race. That history. It is a few gonna get it back again, but if students be all know that social problems are the result of about social problems. We all know that. Right? Like, if I were going to give a talk about world hunger, I've sure you would all agree that I probably shouldn't do that because if I open my mouth and tell you that there are billions of children on this planet starving from lack of nutrition then I probably ought not to see it because if I see it, that's why they will starve. Past this idea that the more we talk about it, the worst it gets because there's no other problem about which we would say that. Conversation would do. And worse ways of addressing the issue of race and racism. And I wanna suggest to you that by and large, our problem stems, I we is that, for the most part, we steadfastly refuse to accept that we ourselves harbor racial bias.

**Title:** Barriers to Effective Dialogue on Race and Racism

**Overview:** The conversation discusses the challenges in having effective dialogues about race and racism. Speaker 0 emphasizes that while conversations about race are not to blame for racism, the manner in which we address these issues matters. Speaker 1 identifies key barriers to effective dialogue: the belief in personal color blindness and the failure to recognize systemic issues. These barriers hinder honest conversations and meaningful action against racism.

That's all that a conversation about races. It can't be blamed for the problem of racism. The same is true with any other social problems. We have to the face. Now having said that, I don't wanna suggest that any about these issues doesn't mean that it's irrelevant how we talk about it. There are better and worse ways of addressing the issue of race and racism.    Speaker 1: issues or barriers to effective dialogue, things that keep us from having the kind of discussion that we really need to have. Maybe 4 if I have time, but 3 for sure. The first is that for the most part, we steadfastly In other words, we take this view that we have attained this pinnacle of color blindness that we do not see or think about race, that, yes, there may be other people out there who are racist, but not me. My uncle Jim, he's an asshole, but not me. I don't have any of that bias. I have, you know, I have black friends. I dated an Asian woman once. I have a dream catcher in my rear view mirror and now I have come to the conclusion that my great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess I can't possibly have any racism in me? That's somebody else's problem, not mine. So our inability to see ourselves as racially biased makes it very difficult to have an honest conversation because we spend so much time trying to divide ourselves into the good people who are not racist and the bad people who are racist that we miss the fact that we're all being programmed and conditioned in racist ways every day. So I'll have more to say about that in a second. But the second Problem. That keeps us from having real dialogue and making progress and taking action after the dialogue is that even when we are willing to acknowledge personal bias, we don't see the systemic problem. So we might be willing to attack the individual racist who does something on a college campus. We might be willing to to punish the women on the softball    Objective Communication Insights:   - Factual Linguistic Observations: The speakers exhibit a mix of clear articulation and some disfluencies, making it occasionally challenging to follow the argumentation.   - Structural Communication Patterns: The speech includes long, complex sentences that can lead to confusion; the use of personal anecdotes adds depth but may detract from clarity.   - Potential Clarity Enhancement Suggestions: Shorten sentences for improved comprehension, reduce filler phrases, and ensure a more structured approach to presenting arguments to enhance overall clarity.

**Title:** Impact of Ocean Heat on Extreme Weather and Future Climate Projections

**Overview:** The conversation discusses the connection between ocean heat absorption and extreme weather events, highlighting data from the State of the Climate 2024 report. Between 2005 and 2023, oceans absorbed an average of 3,100,000 terawatt hours of heat. This has contributed to a rise in atmospheric moisture levels, leading to more frequent extreme weather events such as hurricanes and cyclones. In India, there was an increase in extreme weather events in the first nine months of 2024, with 255 out of 274 days experiencing such events, resulting in significant loss of life. The conversation also touches on future climate projections, warning that current carbon dioxide emission levels could exhaust the 1.5°C carbon budget in six years, with a potential breach of the 2°C limit within 27 years. This poses significant challenges for future generations, including higher sea levels and more extreme weather conditions.

And, there was more than one time that my husband had to get up in the middle of the night and, to go out to figure out what was going on outside. You know, there were a lot of shady here, and there's that we'd come by our house and flood out, like my children are wearing safe to play outside.

Like, what was okay, do you need to give us specific kind of pain points?  Speaker 1: Yeah. Sure. I I would be happy to clarify. No. There were no drugs in my home.

I'm a writer. So I  Speaker 4: apologize.  Speaker 1: I will try to be more direct with my answers.  Speaker 2: Taylor also sent a a a read tip and said if y'all were hearing gunshots why would your man go outside? 10 survival skills.  Speaker 1: Our house that and he would go out  Speaker 5: and  Speaker 1: he himself was on to make sure that nobody was gonna try to get by us. And more than one time, he put himself in harm's way to protect our neighbors as well. Oh, give an example. A  Speaker 5: lot of that  Speaker 3: The big example would be great because it sounds like he's just inserting himself into other people's business and but so far, what you're saying, right, is that he was, like, insertion cell into situations that he wasn't a part of that put your family in danger.
