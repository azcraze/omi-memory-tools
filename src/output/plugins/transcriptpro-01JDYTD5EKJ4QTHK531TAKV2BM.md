Clean those cups.  [00:02:24] Speaker 1: Those are your tank?  [00:02:26] Speaker 3: Maybe the cleanest ones of the and millions that I have. That are dirty.  [00:02:30] User: Paint cups.  [00:02:32] Speaker 1: And where'd you get those up for? For  [00:02:34] Speaker 2: the clear  [00:02:35] User: coat. 4 cups.  [00:02:37] Speaker 3: Just gonna buy it. It said it didn't matter, like, what it looked like after I all after I finished off all that silver, I wasn't doing it again.  [00:02:46] Speaker 1: Is it now good?  [00:02:48] Speaker 2: Yeah.  [00:02:49] Speaker 3: Okay. It  [00:02:51] Speaker 2: looks  [00:02:52] Speaker 3: it looks okay. Hi. It doesn't look perfect. I don't think but I think maybe just in a certain angle. I think it will be fine. Let's see.  [00:03:00] Speaker 1: I think maybe  [00:03:02] Speaker 3: Yeah. Exactly. Why I'm just  [00:03:04] Speaker 4: doing  [00:03:05] Speaker 3: it. I mean, granted it  [00:03:07] Speaker 4: is  [00:03:08] Speaker 3: a paint job of for a car. I think it should be done as right as possible, but Yeah. But my thing was I wasn't being lazy. Can't figure out the technique with what I have, and there's no fucking, like, way I would find people to explain how to do it with what I have. And then also, I've been a identify or talk about the exact problem I'm running into and how to fix it.  [00:03:30] Speaker 1: What exactly is the problem you're running into?  [00:03:33] Speaker 3: The issue with the, like, the shiny being the it being not as shiny in some spots only, because I'm telling you, it's not gonna it's not necessarily it has something to do with, like,  [00:03:41] Speaker 1: Is your paint not staying mixed up?  [00:03:43] Speaker 3: It has nothing. It's not that. Because if that were the case, it's being atomized when it's, like, exiting the airbrush. And also the fact it's not like that everywhere.  [00:03:52] Speaker 1: But if it's separating in the cup, or, like, the glitter's floating down to the bottom so that sinking down to the bottom  [00:03:57] Speaker 3: I know what you're saying, but, yes, I mix it up. I definitely mix it up before I pour it  [00:04:02] Speaker 4: in.  [00:04:03] Speaker 3: Every single time. Definitely. Definitely. But regardless, that one has changed  [00:04:08] Speaker 1: spraying it from when you pour it to when it's all all out?  [00:04:11] Speaker 3: Yeah. No. That's why that's why I have a glue on it and I shake it the whole time. That's why I was that's why I kept spilling it because I was used to having the lid on it. So I could shake it and make sure it wasn't separating. You know? But regardless, that still wouldn't change the color of  [00:04:23] Speaker 2: it.  [00:04:24] Speaker 3: Why would I change the color? The colors are still out of the gun. It's saying it's either if it separates, it's just color and then clear. You know? But the problem is I think that whenever it does spray sometimes, like, probably what you're saying in a way is that it gets separated. So some of it comes out like, dryer, so it creates a rougher Spot on like a spot, a rougher spot. A  [00:04:46] Speaker 1: reference.  [00:04:48] Speaker 4: And  [00:04:49] Speaker 3: then some of it comes out like smooth, And so I think I don't know. I I don't know for sure because I've also sanded it after a coat to make sure it was all uniformly smooth and then the same issue. Mhmm. But then so then I just did, like, then I tried it by doing, like, just 20 layers and not smoothing it so that maybe it just all got rough. And then that didn't really seem to help, but just seemed like some of these blocks got rougher. Then they still were a different color. And they still  [00:05:11] User: wear a different kind of  [00:05:12] Speaker 4: shiny.  [00:05:14] Speaker 3: But also the fact that I'm using I it could also be the fact that I'm using I used matte medium and also gloss medium. That  [00:05:21] Speaker 1: definitely  [00:05:22] Speaker 3: Well, hold on.  [00:05:24] User: It could matter, but I mix them both, and also  [00:05:27] Speaker 3: it could be the fact that it looks like that because of the matte medium, but and then it would be it would be fine when it's glossy. Is what I'm trying to say, I guess.  [00:05:35] Speaker 4: Yeah. If  [00:05:36] Speaker 1: you cover it if you cover it with gloss, it'll stay gloss. I'm covering it with metal, I'm saying that.  [00:05:40] Speaker 3: Yeah. Of  [00:05:41] Speaker 2: course.  [00:05:42] User: I'm just this is just  [00:05:43] Speaker 3: the medium for the acrylic water based paint, though. So whatever. That looks like if it's not, if I spray it with matte, it will be matte until I spray it with glossy it will be  [00:05:50] User: shiny and glossy, and it will be fine.  [00:05:52] Speaker 1: Whatever the last layer is is what's  [00:05:54] Speaker 3: Yeah. Of course. I'm assuming though maybe that's the issue with the consistency on the colors. No. That's old as fuck.  [00:06:01] Speaker 2: I that's all I was drinking soon.  [00:06:03] Speaker 1: Oh, I promise that. I I know. No.  [00:06:06] Speaker 3: It does.  [00:06:07] User: Wait. Wait. Where's my journal? Oh, yeah. I know. Where did my journal go? Right. I found it.  [00:06:12] Speaker 3: Did I just mark on my forehead now? I just knew I was, like, rubbed  [00:06:16] Speaker 5: the tan across  [00:06:18] Speaker 3: my forehead, and I didn't know which end or if it was open or what.  [00:06:21] Speaker 1: Yeah. And  [00:06:23] Speaker 3: Hey.  [00:06:24] Speaker 5: Uh-huh.  [00:06:25] User: Oh, no reason. You're Jimador.  [00:06:28] Speaker 3: That sounds weird.  [00:06:30] Speaker 2: Great.  [00:06:32] User: I couldn't find this part This is the silver part.  [00:06:34] Speaker 3: For  [00:06:35] User: the charger. It's it's just like a quick quick connect charger thingy Mhmm. For USB 3 or whatever the c, I mean. Not 3.  [00:06:43] Speaker 1: C. USB 3PO?  [00:06:45] User: I couldn't find the crystal next thing. I k. Or I couldn't find this thing, but I had the other part of it, so I took it.  [00:06:51] Speaker 2: This is yeah. It's the magnet  [00:06:53] User: one. But it's quick. It comes off right off. And so then I took that piece out And now I know where that piece is, and I don't know where the  [00:07:01] Speaker 3: other pieces. I thought it was on here, but it's not.  [00:07:04] User: I mean, yeah, nothing is coming.  [00:07:06] Speaker 1: No. I  [00:07:07] Speaker 4: didn't.  [00:07:08] User: Now I'm just leaving for the trip. Now it's just important, and we not have the connecting portfolio.  [00:07:14] Speaker 2: And  [00:07:16] Speaker 3: But that was because I don't know why.

And today might not be    [00:00:58] Speaker 4: What are you    [00:01:00] Speaker 1: doing? I have to love you.    [00:01:02] Speaker 3: In case it's not really a logical solution, depends on cake. You guys have left me. I love you. I should probably write this down. And I guess that's not really a logical solution, but that's okay. Because I'll always wanna be here for you. So I'll be here for you.    [00:01:19] Speaker 1: Fucking    [00:01:20] Speaker 3: rocket launch.    [00:01:21] User: I don't understand. Actually, not really an it was kinda cute, but I don't get it.    [00:01:26] Speaker 1: Just me saying I love you. Well,    [00:01:28] User: I knew that, but why    [00:01:30] Speaker 1: is it    [00:01:31] User: today is not really your best    [00:01:33] Speaker 3: day.    [00:01:34] Speaker 1: I don't know. It was I didn't break the words, babe.    [00:01:38] Speaker 5: But I'm just saying in general, why would anybody send that to anybody? As in, like, I've run like,    [00:01:43] Speaker 4: Oh,    [00:01:44] User: no.    [00:01:45] Speaker 1: You don't have to wash it. It's just That's what's so great.    [00:01:48] Speaker 2: Yeah,    [00:01:49] Speaker 1: I    [00:01:50] Speaker 3: guess.    [00:01:51] Speaker 1: That's fucking horrible.    [00:01:53] User: I mean, it    [00:01:54] Speaker 5: probably the thing would be funny by itself, but the caption makes it so horrible. Because I'm sure what they're talking about has nothing to do with that caption at all. But somebody saw that and was like, how can I make women and men hate each other more? Let me just take what they're saying, and it's funny, and make it like, women actually genuinely wanting men to communicate more. And then them and then them using this video clip which is funny by itself, and using it as the answer to that. As the response to that. No?    [00:02:29] Speaker 1: Yes.    [00:02:30] Speaker 5: Wait. What?    [00:02:31] Speaker 4: Like, I    [00:02:32] Speaker 1: don't I don't see how that,    [00:02:34] Speaker 4: like,    [00:02:35] Speaker 1: it's driving a wedge between men and women Like    [00:02:38] Speaker 5: Is that is that it's funny because basically, it's Okay. Is the concern of what like, somebody, like, of wanting you to communicate more valid or not?    [00:02:46] Speaker 1: No. It's valid.    [00:02:48] Speaker 5: Okay.    [00:02:49] Speaker 1: But, like, it's like it's it's like showing how fucking dude talk to do talk to other dudes.    [00:02:55] Speaker 3: No.    [00:02:56] Speaker 5: It's not. It basically saying that it's a can that they can communicate, that they just talk like that, basically. Saying that they're incapable of fulfilling that need.    [00:03:05] Speaker 1: No.    [00:03:06] Speaker 5: But you just said that. You    [00:03:08] Speaker 1: literally just said said it's    [00:03:09] Speaker 4: showing how    [00:03:10] Speaker 1: dudes have talk talk to dudes. Like    [00:03:13] Speaker 5: And what does that have to do with men women then? And also,    [00:03:17] Speaker 1: Like, because it's not dudes saying that dude, we need to communicate more. It's saying that's usually, like, between a man and a woman saying we need to communicate better. Type thing. Like, What?    [00:03:28] Speaker 3: What    [00:03:29] Speaker 5: is the point in the caption? Does it not say something about women?    [00:03:32] Speaker 1: It says fucking Women, I wish men communicated more.    [00:03:36] Speaker 4: On    [00:03:37] Speaker 1: how men communicate.    [00:03:39] Speaker 3: Yeah.    [00:03:40] Speaker 1: Like, by fucking basic    [00:03:42] Speaker 4: basically    [00:03:43] Speaker 1: say no. I don't wanna fucking communicate your feelings, like, to to between dudes. No. I don't wanna fucking communicate    [00:03:49] Speaker 4: the    [00:03:50] Speaker 1: feelings or whatever with another dude,    [00:03:52] Speaker 3: and    [00:03:53] Speaker 1: then they go on to fucking clowning on it.    [00:03:55] Speaker 5: Then it could just be something about, like, how dudes don't support each    [00:03:58] User: other.    [00:03:59] Speaker 5: Kind of thing. That should be the caption of it. Not having anything to do with a woman's actual bowel concern. What I'm saying is that that means that men are just incapable of communicating.    [00:04:06] Speaker 1: I disagree.    [00:04:08] Speaker 4: Oh, I    [00:04:09] Speaker 5: didn't ask you that when    [00:04:11] Speaker 4: you were coming    [00:04:12] Speaker 1: myself.    [00:04:14] Speaker 3: Really?    [00:04:15] Speaker 4: Yes.    [00:04:16] Speaker 5: Tell me how that showed that men were able to communicate    [00:04:19] Speaker 3: then.    [00:04:20] Speaker 5: Didn't it just basically say men aren't capable of communicating? That that's what they do when they try to communicate? Is that not what it's saying? Is it? You're right?    [00:04:28] User: Really?    [00:04:29] Speaker 1: Yes. Like,    [00:04:31] Speaker 4: I    [00:04:32] Speaker 1: don't understand what I'm supposed to say in that moment because if I say Because    [00:04:36] Speaker 4: I'm    [00:04:37] Speaker 3: asking you    [00:04:38] Speaker 4: a question. If    [00:04:39] Speaker 2: I say    [00:04:41] Speaker 1: if I say you're right, then you fucking    [00:04:43] Speaker 4: you    [00:04:44] Speaker 1: you don't    [00:04:45] Speaker 4: believe it.    [00:04:46] Speaker 1: But if I continue arguing, we we continue arguing. So what do you want me to say? Because I agree with you. You changed my mind.    [00:04:53] Speaker 5: Well, you know, saying I'm not pissing me off more than anything. So maybe not say that? What do you mean? Then    [00:04:59] Speaker 4: I'm    [00:05:00] Speaker 5: not I'm not gonna be    [00:05:02] Speaker 3: right.    [00:05:03] Speaker 4: Then    [00:05:05] Speaker 2: I'm That's the whole thing. It's the exact same    [00:05:08] User: thing.    [00:05:09] Speaker 5: You disagreed with me literally like, one response previously, You disagreed with me. Okay?    [00:05:14] Speaker 2: I'm sorry. I don't know how    [00:05:16] Speaker 1: responses should it take for me to change my mind?    [00:05:19] Speaker 5: If you let me finish what I was saying, I'm saying that you literally just with me. You had a lot to say when you disagree with    [00:05:25] Speaker 2: me.    [00:05:26] Speaker 5: So then suddenly, when you just agree with me, after not saying anything, I'm sorry if it's hard for me to take it as a genuine agree and not just wanting to not talk about it anymore.    [00:05:33] Speaker 1: The reason why I wasn't saying anything is because I was fucking thinking about it.    [00:05:37] User: Okay. You don't communicate these things with me.    [00:05:39] Speaker 5: Why are you not communicating now with me? I mean, I don't know. I'm just saying you you have a lot to say    [00:05:43] Speaker 2: when you were disagreeing with me. Maybe before even disagreeing with me, you could ask me to see to see my understanding or try and change my mind on it. So anything with a captain, Minh, colon women, colon, anything like that is divisive, period. It is divisive. That's what that that's the only purpose it it serves. It's to divide us. I mean, if it's I mean, something like that basically, where not showing your emotion to be able to    [00:06:09] Speaker 1: Please. Please. Please. Please. Please.    [00:06:11] Speaker 5: What is b what is b by talking passionately about this doing to    [00:06:14] Speaker 4: you? It's    [00:06:15] Speaker 1: it rises passion in myself. Like, I makes me I respond, I speak louder. Now you    [00:06:20] Speaker 5: send it out. I'm not trying    [00:06:22] Speaker 1: to fucking yell at you. I'm not trying to be yelled at. I'm asking please can we just speak to one another? That's all I'm asking. I don't know why the fuck that is so difficult    [00:06:31] Speaker 2: Because I am talking passionately about something, and if that's okay with you, I'm sorry. I I mean, I know it's okay with you. But I'm sorry. I care about this.    [00:06:38] Speaker 1: So if I speak passionately about something that I care about Yeah. I have a lot of y'all about it?    [00:06:43] Speaker 2: And you're about to speak passionately about something, would you just scream at me? That's different. I never tell you You're not I never tell you to be quiet like you tell me all the time. What do you mean you always focus on how I'm like, my behavior. I mean, dude, all the time    [00:07:02] Speaker 4: you tell me that ask you politely please.    [00:07:05] Speaker 2: And I am sorry. It is the way I'm communicating. I'm not yelling at you. I'm trying to express something I'm like, I care about. I    [00:07:11] Speaker 1: understand that you care about it, and    [00:07:13] Speaker 4: I understand that your    [00:07:14] Speaker 5: passionate about    [00:07:15] Speaker 2: it. So stop taking it, and so    [00:07:19] Speaker 5: stop being defensive about    [00:07:20] Speaker 2: it. I'm allowed to be passionate about something.    [00:07:22] Speaker 1: Maybe I just don't like being fucking yelled    [00:07:25] Speaker 4: at. I'm not    [00:07:26] Speaker 2: getting at you. That's what I'm saying. Now I am.    [00:07:29] User: When something is trying to explain away why men are able to do that are harmful to themselves and it's okay, and excusing harmful behaviors such as not communicating,    [00:07:39] Speaker 5: or not communicating with other men a genuine way at all because you're not supposed to do that or else you're, like, what a soy boy or whatever the fuck they    [00:07:46] Speaker 4: say.    [00:07:47] Speaker 5: That's harmful and not okay, and you should be able to do that. So using it as a way to be like,    [00:07:51] Speaker 2: oh, it's just how it boys will    [00:07:53] Speaker 5: be boys things.    [00:07:54] Speaker 2: It's it's    [00:07:55] User: is a programming we need to, like,    [00:07:57] Speaker 2: unlearn.    [00:07:58] Speaker 5: It feeds into this narrative that    [00:08:01] Speaker 2: Women are just nurturing and you know, they're good at communicating and caring about emotions stuff like that, but, like, but for them to never expect it in return    [00:08:09] User: You can't expect it from men.    [00:08:11] Speaker 5: I don't know why we teach to be like that anyways. I mean, I do know. If you're not able to be empathetic or, like, care about other people, then you literally    [00:08:19] Speaker 2: will not do anything but care about only yourself.    [00:08:22] Speaker 5: And you'll also just be destroyed    [00:08:24] Speaker 2: inside.    [00:08:25] User: But if you can engage empathetically with others, a whole lot will change.    [00:08:29] Speaker 2: Again, I didn't I don't see anything wrong with the video clip. They were being, like,    [00:08:32] Speaker 5: they weren't it was not personal attacks. It was not, like, taking other    [00:08:36] User: down on things. Like, I I don't know. It was    [00:08:39] Speaker 5: It could be funny, whatever. Like, I saw that it's, like, harmless pretty much. I didn't understand everything you were saying, but But then whoever sees this clip and decides to put this caption when I am sure that is literally not the point in the conversation whatsoever in the game clip, And post it on Facebook and it gets shit loads of share reshares and whatever the fuck likes and rec I don't know what it's called. And Facebook just fucking, like, regurgitates regurgitates his brain rot over and over again.    [00:09:03] User: I mean, that's how I sleep.    [00:09:05] Speaker 3: Makes sense.    [00:09:06] Speaker 1: My hands look bad.    [00:09:08] Speaker 3: Hi.    [00:09:09] User: Did they feel like they're swollen or anything?    [00:09:11] Speaker 1: No. But I I guess I'm just, like, not Fucking skinny is like, like, used to be because, like, you should all see all my fucking like, basically, all my fucking bones in my    [00:09:20] Speaker 5: hands. Well, how long ago was    [00:09:23] Speaker 4: that?    [00:09:24] Speaker 1: I don't know. Last time I, like, looked at my hands like this.    [00:09:28] User: Let me see.

**Title:** Discussion on Hammer Drill vs Regular Drill

**Overview:** The conversation primarily revolves around the differences in cutting ability between a hammer drill and a regular drill. Speaker 1 explains how the hammer drill operates similarly to an impact wrench, using a counterweight to maintain cutting efficiency when encountering resistance, such as pockets of air in masonry. The hammer drill is described as more effective, making smoother and less time-consuming cuts compared to a regular drill. The discussion briefly touches on the experiences and observations of using these tools.

And that you'll listen to me and not dismiss the things I care about or things that my feelings in general that's one thing that is consistently not changed at all And it's not good. Me, really, but not you, Levi? I So it matters to me. Also, I figured I know it's just another day of the year, but I feel like maybe we should do this so that we cannot go  [00:04:09] Speaker 2: into the next year with the with these misunderstandings. So I mean, do you not think that there's anything that we need to talk about? Or did feel like we should  [00:04:17] Speaker 5: like, Both of us hearing each other out. And being patient with each other  [00:04:20] Speaker 4: or,  [00:04:21] Speaker 5: like, chief on my list of 2 things that we definitely need to work on.  [00:04:24] Speaker 2: But that doesn't ex that doesn't talk about, like, I mean, you're right. But I Like, when you tell me that I just love to fight kind of stuff. Or that, like, you think I'm just always angry. I mean is that what you really feel like?  [00:04:35] Speaker 4: No.  [00:04:36] Speaker 2: But you say it.  [00:04:37] Speaker 5: I say it in times that we're fighting because in times that we're fighting,  [00:04:40] Speaker 2: But I don't say things like that that I don't mean. I mean, I say I call you names like I call you very generic general names, like which  [00:04:46] User: isn't okay. I'm not saying it's okay. But  [00:04:48] Speaker 5: Very beautiful.  [00:04:49] User: I know, like, name calling is not okay, but  [00:04:52] Speaker 2: I never tell you things like That that I don't mean that I know is not true,  [00:04:55] Speaker 5: I say shit like that because of, like, the like, the premise that starts the fight It's like it's just a fucking simple misunderstanding  [00:05:00] Speaker 4: or  [00:05:01] Speaker 5: you know, just something like that Like, if I say something fucking stupid or whatever, and I'm not serious about it, but, like, you take me serious for it, and it starts a fight. Like, what the fuck are we even fucking fighting for? Like, I fucking didn't even mean what I said. So it's like, I don't understand why it gets fucking blown into this fucking knockdown drag out fight When I wasn't even serious when I said what I said. And I can't think of it specifically which fight I'm referring to, but I do know that that's happened at least once. And I was just I'm just like, wow. Why? What? Right. Sorry. That's why I said that. I we need to work on that. We still just work on each other out and then you know, being patient with each other because I'm still I'm still fucking at the beginning of fucking path as far as, like, like, seeing things, like, from your perspective or, like, the way you see them or Wait. And unlearning the shit that I've been fucking brainwashed with, So, like, I'm gonna say fucking stupid shit sometimes. I'm gonna fucking say that I think this way about something when it's, like, definitely not the right way to fucking think about it because that's where I am at present. And I know that I'm on the fucking journey, so, like, I I need you to, like, be patient with me in those moments and not like, immediately start, like, a what I feel is like, attacking me when it's Not you attacking me. It's you, like, addressing what the fuck I just said or whatever. But, like, it's I don't know. Maybe it's maybe it's my insecurity with what the fuck I'd like, knowing that I'm thinking maybe the fucking what I'm saying isn't the fucking right thing to say, touch Good. But, like, I say it because it's a response to the conversation. I I don't fucking know how to avoid what I'm saying, but  [00:06:23] Speaker 4: I I don't fucking know.  [00:06:24] Speaker 2: It's okay, you know. They don't do that.  [00:06:26] Speaker 5: I  [00:06:27] Speaker 4: I  [00:06:28] Speaker 5: Like, if I say some shit that I learned that I don't agree with and then I get taken for absolutely believing in what I just said. Like,  [00:06:34] Speaker 4: I  [00:06:35] Speaker 5: it's almost like a fucking almost like an insult to be taking, like, As I believe in that shit. You know what I mean? Because, like, if I if I say some shit that, I've learned that I disagree with, but it's what is in my head. But I disagree with it. And it's like, taken for like, I'm speaking gospel type shit. I'm just like, damn. Like, how fucking dumb Do you think I am? To fuck if you think that I actually believe this shit, But  [00:06:52] Speaker 2: I understand why.  [00:06:53] Speaker 5: Like, I it's like I said, it's that's that one's on me for sure.  [00:06:56] Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I don't think that you owe when you say things that are what you've been told. In fact, I think that that's The case a lot of the times  [00:07:01] User: especially because it's always something where you say you heard from Zach.  [00:07:04] Speaker 2: And so, I mean and I already I already kind of figured that every time you say something like that. But I don't know how I'm supposed to respond if you know, like, I I guess, like,  [00:07:13] User: you say that you don't believe it, but then I  [00:07:15] Speaker 2: don't understand why it's the response. You Give me I guess.  [00:07:18] User: Or or you could just say that, like, yeah. So and so told me this or I saw this you  [00:07:21] Speaker 2: know, this and let me know explicitly that is what you were told, but you don't believe it. Kind of thing. Because  [00:07:27] User: if you just say something out of your own, like, mouth and not saying it's somebody else's, like, like, idea, then what am I supposed to think other than  [00:07:32] Speaker 2: that? It is what you  [00:07:33] User: believe. But regardless of whether or  [00:07:35] Speaker 4: not it is what  [00:07:36] Speaker 3: you  [00:07:37] User: believe because it's  [00:07:38] Speaker 2: the only thing you've heard. Is  [00:07:39] User: is beside the point. I mean, I'm not mad at you. Anyways, But I'm just trying to explain to you, like, why what you said is wrong. Or at least give you a different perspective, and then  [00:07:46] Speaker 2: you to, like, I I mean, if it's not your ideas, then there's no need to be, like, offended and also, like, I understand that most of the time, and I'm not trying to, like, I'm just trying to get you to  [00:07:53] User: think critically about it.  [00:07:54] Speaker 2: So you can come to a different understanding. But I don't think that you're stupid at all. I don't. But if you say something, that has that's not of sound reasoning or just like devoid of any critical thought. I'm gonna say it. I wanna tell you so that you can think about it critically and realize that, like, these are the things that we're told and we're told also to not even think about things. Not to think for ourselves. And we have to think for ourselves Well, I said  [00:08:13] Speaker 4: We  [00:08:14] Speaker 5: do.  [00:08:15] Speaker 2: Yeah. Then in their cases, I don't know sometimes because you get like, I'm just trying to tell you that what you have said is wrong and trying to like, explain  [00:08:21] User: to you. Like, I understand that it's what you told us. It's only thing you've been told about this subject. Like, what else are you supposed to think or what else do you know? But the fact I'm bringing you a different perspective you can tell me what you've been told You could even ask me questions to debunk your own thoughts,  [00:08:34] Speaker 2: I guess, like, you know, maybe or Good. Get you a better understanding or ask me questions and make me think about what I said. Maybe you think about my logic on things like  [00:08:41] User: promise you, I would change my mind like that, like, It's  [00:08:43] Speaker 2: there is yeah. I mean, I have no problem changing my mind. I wasn't always like that. That's for sure. But I don't think that you're stupid. I never do. I I wouldn't be with you.  [00:08:52] Speaker 4: But  [00:08:53] Speaker 2: I could, like, I'm writing down rules. I can move pen to work. What?  [00:08:56] Speaker 5: I just had a wonderful idea.  [00:08:58] Speaker 4: What?  [00:08:59] Speaker 5: It's completely off topic.

Stick to the topic at hand without deflecting. Acknowledge each other's  [00:02:10] Speaker 1: emotions  [00:02:11] Speaker 2: without dismissing them.  [00:02:12] Speaker 1: 2,  [00:02:13] Speaker 2: identify the key issues to address here are the  [00:02:16] Speaker 3: main areas to  [00:02:17] Speaker 2: address. Based on your concern. Dismissible of your feelings, share how it When I try to share my  [00:02:23] Speaker 1: feelings,  [00:02:24] Speaker 2: and it's dismissed as me being angry or wanting to fight, feel unheard and like my emotions still matter. It's important to me that you take my feelings seriously even if you don't fully understand them right  [00:02:34] Speaker 3: away.  [00:02:35] Speaker 2: Ask a question to prompt reflection. How do you think we can create a space for both of our feelings are validated and addressed without it feeling like a fight? Weak defensiveness and avoidance of accountability  [00:02:46] Speaker 3: bring  [00:02:47] Speaker 2: up his defensiveness shuts down conversations and prevents resolution. When you respond to my concerns by saying I didn't do anything, feels like we're stuck in a loop where the issue doesn't get resolved. I  [00:03:01] Speaker 3: need us  [00:03:02] Speaker 2: to focus on understanding each other's perspectives instead of immediately defending ourselves. Request a change. What I need from you is to take a moment to listen when I express concern and acknowledge how your actions might have impacted me. Even if it wasn't your intention. Can we work on that? See, lack of engagement in resolving  [00:03:23] Speaker 3: issue  [00:03:24] Speaker 2: point out how his inaction affects the relationship.

It leaves me feeling emotionally drained while you move on. Suggest actionable changes like us to have a follow-up conversation after I share something important where we both talk through what we've or discussed. Would you be open to that?  [00:03:50] Speaker 1: See,  [00:03:51] Speaker 2: using excuses  [00:03:52] Speaker 3: for an  [00:03:53] Speaker 2: action addresses you so it doesn't have an overnight as a reason not to engage. I understand that change takes time, I've been patient because  [00:04:02] Speaker 3: I  [00:04:03] Speaker 2: believe in you,  [00:04:04] Speaker 1: Euna.  [00:04:06] Speaker 2: But when it feels like no effort is being made, it's hard for me to feel  [00:04:10] Speaker 3: hopeful.

To work. I believe we love each other  [00:04:30] Speaker 1: deeply.  [00:04:32] Speaker 2: But love alone isn't enough. We need to work together to make sure our actions show that love. Step 2, discuss specific patterns used neutral, non language to describe recurring issues. I've noticed that when I try to bring up something that's bothering me, it often turns into a fight  [00:04:50] Speaker 3: because  [00:04:51] Speaker 1: we're  [00:04:52] Speaker 3: focused  [00:04:53] Speaker 2: defending ourselves instead of understanding each other. I want  [00:04:56] Speaker 1: to change  [00:04:57] Speaker 2: that. I also feel like we're stuck in a cycle where we apologize, but don't address the behavior that caused the hurt in the 1st  [00:05:05] Speaker 1: place.  [00:05:06] Speaker 2: This leaves the issue  [00:05:07] Speaker 1: unresolved  [00:05:08] Speaker 2: we end up fighting about the same things over and over. Step 3, invited perspective ask open ended questions to encourage him to reflect How do you feel when I bring up concerns?  [00:05:18] Speaker 3: Do you  [00:05:19] Speaker 2: feel like I'm attacking you? What can I do to make these conversations feel less stressful for  [00:05:23] Speaker 3: you? Do you think we're  [00:05:24] Speaker 2: addressing the root of our  [00:05:26] Speaker 3: issues  [00:05:27] Speaker 2: do you feel like we're stuck in surface level arguments?

[00:05:46] Speaker 3: I need you to engage with the things I share, whether it's a letter or a conversation. That  [00:05:51] Speaker 2: helps  [00:05:52] Speaker 3: me feel like my thoughts and feelings matter to  [00:05:54] Speaker 1: you.  [00:05:56] Speaker 3: I need us to address the patterns of dismissing or avoiding accountability when something hurts either of  [00:06:01] Speaker 1: us.  [00:06:02] Speaker 3: Accountability isn't about blame. It's about growth. For plan for future conflicts, end the conversation by creating a plan for to handle disagreements moving forward. Let's agree to take a break if an argument escalates and come back to it when we're calm.

What's up?  [00:07:48] Speaker 3: Feel free to  [00:07:49] Speaker 1: Hey. How's it going? Hi. Hey.  [00:07:52] Speaker 2: I'm Hey. It's great to meet  [00:07:54] Speaker 1: Hey.  [00:07:55] Speaker 2: Hey. What's  [00:07:57] Speaker 3: up? Feel free to ask me There's a step by step approach to help you structure the  [00:08:00] Speaker 4: conversation with your fiance so it remains productive, respectful, and goal oriented. The focus is on mutual understanding taking responsibility, establishing a plan for how to address issues in the future. Not on assigning blame. Power star 1, set the tone and ground rules. 1, agree on intentions. Express that both of you want a loving, respectful relationship, and that the goal of the conversation is to strengthen your bond, not to win an argument. Say something like, I want us to move forward feeling heard and respected, and I'm hoping we can figure out how to do that together. 2, define basic guidelines. No insults or name calling. Each person speaks without interruption. Both parties commit to listening and asking clarifying questions before disagreeing. 3. Emphasize calm engagement. If emotions rise too high, agree to take a short break and reconvene. For instance, if either of us feels overwhelmed, let's pause for 10 minutes and then come back when we've calmed  [00:08:52] Speaker 1: down.  [00:08:53] Speaker 2: 2.  [00:08:54] Speaker 4: Start with validation and common ground. 1, acknowledge  [00:08:57] Speaker 1: the good.  [00:08:58] Speaker 4: Even if things are tense, start by acknowledging something you appreciate about him or the relationship. This helps disarm defensiveness. I appreciate how you always help with x y z. Or I love that we both want this relationship to work. 2, explain why this matters to you. Clarify that you're doing this not to fight, but because you care. I'm bringing up these issues so we can be stronger together. Not to criticize you as a person. Not our 3. Address the core communication patterns. A, defensiveness and gaslighting. What to say. Sometimes when I bring up something that hurts me, you go into defense mode or tell me I'm crazy. For feeling that way. That makes me feel dismissed. I'd like us to focus on hearing each other without dismissing or deflecting. Ask for a commitment. Could you try to listen first? And ask me clarifying questions about why I feel a certain way rather than assuming I'm attacking you. B, dismissal of your emotions and beliefs. What to say? When I share something personal, like how I dislike being intentionally annoyed, You sometimes say it's no big deal, but it is a big deal to me. I need you to at least consider my feelings as valid. Ask for a commitment. If you disagree, can you still acknowledge my feelings and explore why I feel the way I do, instead of just telling me I'm over reacting or that it's nothing, c, avoiding accountability. What to say? I noticed that whenever we fight, you sometimes apologize initially, but later, you act like you never did. This makes me feel like the apology didn't mean anything. It's important to me that we both stand by our words. Ask for a commitment. Can we agree to own our apologies and not erase them later? If either of us feels misunderstood after an apology, we should talk it through rather than deny we ever apologized. 4, dive into specific contentious issues. A. Intentional annoyance, playful teasing. Explain the impact. When you do x, I feel y. It might be playful to you, but it hurts me or makes me feel disrespected. I want us to find a better way to joke around. Ask for willingness to understand. Could you ask me why it makes me feel that way so we can find a compromise that works for both of us? B, gender roles and mutual respect. Frame it constructively. I believe we both value a relationship where our voices are equally respected. When you do something like expecting me to laugh off teasing, it feels like my feelings are taken seriously. Ask for reflection. How do you see traditional or gendered expectations affecting our communication? Can we find common ground on how we interact so neither of us feels put down or c, his claims about your anger both belittling him. Reiterate your good intentions. Understand you feel I'm angry or belittling. I'm not trying to disrespect your experiences, especially about race or identity. I just want us to be able to question ideas without it turning Invite his perspective. Can you share an example of when you felt belittled? And let's see if there's a misunderstanding or a better way I could communicate next time. D, racial awareness and avoiding false consciousness. Set realistic expectations. I'm not asking you to change overnight, but I am asking for effort. If you say you understand that it takes time, great. But I need to see you actively thinking about these issues, not dismissing them. Give concrete steps. Suggest reading something together or discussing a documentary's essay. Ask him to approach you with questions instead of assuming he already knows your views or feeling forced to agree. 9, outline clear asks and actions. After presenting your concerns, be explicit about what you're hoping he will do going forward. 1, listen and inquire before disagreeing. When I say something bothers me, please ask me more about why it bothers me instead of deciding you already know. 2, take ownership of apologies. You apologize during a fight, please don't later say you never apologized or that you were never at fault. 3, engage with my letter's notes. When I pour my heart out in a letter, I want you to address at least 1 or 2 points in response. Like, actually respond to what I said so I know you've heard me.  [00:09:42] Speaker 2: 4,  [00:09:43] Speaker 4: participate in a check-in. Maybe once a week, we do a short check-in. We each share one thing that went well and one thing we'd like to improve. That way, things don't build up into a fight. 6, ask him directly. What do you need from me? Show willingness to compromise. I don't want this to feel one-sided. Please tell me what you need. How can I make you feel heard, respected, and loved? Encourage specifics.

If you wanted to tell me that you had 2 black friends, which I maybe You would have said a couple, not many.

But more importantly, even if every one of us was telling the truth, it wouldn't matter, would it? What does that mean that the color have to do with whether or not you might be free racially biased? See, we act like somehow that's a get out of jail free card. That we can't be racist, that we have racist, we can't have the logic of that. We have that makes no damn sense at all.

**Title:** Barriers to Effective Dialogue on Race and Racism

**Overview:** The conversation discusses the challenges in having effective dialogues about race and racism. Speaker 0 emphasizes that while conversations about race are not to blame for racism, the manner in which we address these issues matters. Speaker 1 identifies key barriers to effective dialogue: the belief in personal color blindness and the failure to recognize systemic issues. These barriers hinder honest conversations and meaningful action against racism.

That's all that a conversation about races. It can't be blamed for the problem of racism. The same is true with any other social problems. We have to the face. Now having said that, I don't wanna suggest that any about these issues doesn't mean that it's irrelevant how we talk about it. There are better and worse ways of addressing the issue of race and racism.  [00:32] Speaker 1: issues or barriers to effective dialogue, things that keep us from having the kind of discussion that we really need to have. Maybe 4 if I have time, but 3 for sure. The first is that for the most part, we steadfastly In other words, we take this view that we have attained this pinnacle of color blindness that we do not see or think about race, that, yes, there may be other people out there who are racist, but not me. My uncle Jim, he's an asshole, but not me. I don't have any of that bias. I have, you know, I have black friends. I dated an Asian woman once. I have a dream catcher in my rear view mirror and now I have come to the conclusion that my great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess I can't possibly have any racism in me? That's somebody else's problem, not mine. So our inability to see ourselves as racially biased makes it very difficult to have an honest conversation because we spend so much time trying to divide ourselves into the good people who are not racist and the bad people who are racist that we miss the fact that we're all being programmed and conditioned in racist ways every day. So I'll have more to say about that in a second. But the second Problem. That keeps us from having real dialogue and making progress and taking action after the dialogue is that even when we are willing to acknowledge personal bias, we don't see the systemic problem. So we might be willing to attack the individual racist who does something on a college campus. We might be willing to to punish the women on the softball  Linguistic Analysis Annotations:  Verbal Fillers: 0 Interruption Frequency: 0 Emotional Tone Variations: Frustration, urgency regarding the need for honest conversations about race.

And that's what happened. It was like the women's softball team, there were some racist incident. They're like, oh, we know how we're gonna solve that. We're gonna make them read this book they don't wanna read. Amazing. And they brought me in, and I was supposed to talk to them If you ever write a book and have somebody assigned it as punishment, you know, you freely arrived. You're Ego will be taken down several notches as was mine. This, on the other hand, is fantastic because in order for all of you to be here as punishment, there would have to be some crazy amount of racist shit out on the campus, and I'm gonna really hope that that is not the case. And if it is, do not let me know. I need to get out of here relatively safely. Guess extra credit still counts for something though, which is not nice, right, to see. Because I know that when the crowds are this big, usually, there's some academic bribery involved. I'm cool with that. I don't really care why you came. Like, I don't care whether you're here because issues of racism or the stuff that gets you out of bed in the morning and it gets your blood pumping or whether you're here for the extra credit. Either way, you're here and I'm here and I keep the lights on very deliberately so that if you get up to leave, I will totally notice and call that shit out. So you might just wanna hang out It's just an hour of your life. You ain't gonna get it back again, but it won't be that painful. And it'll hopefully be informative. You're not under any obligation to agree with the things that I say. The only thing you have to do is listen and then and then having this conversation and continuing this dialogue with the folks on this campus who I have no doubt faculty, staff, administrators, and students have been wanting and desiring this  [00:08:12] User: and  [00:08:14] Speaker 1: around issues of racial equity for a long time, and those folks are disproportionately people of color to whom we need to learn to listen and whose lead we need those of us called white to follow when it comes to creating racial equities. So on the one hand, I'm very glad to be here as, you know, a aspiring white ally to talk about these issues, but the real work and the real leader on this subject speak out about them every week yet who are often ignored. I hope that the next time there is a program on this campus in which not a white man, but a person of color is above you on this podium speaking that you will be here just as readily as you are this evening because  [00:09:01] User: only then  [00:09:02] Speaker 1: we really know that we're making progress as a society. When a person of color can get up and say all of the things that I'm about to  [00:09:11] User: Oh, really?  [00:09:12] Speaker 1: Power, and be taken as seriously as I expect to be Oh, what the hell? Get the amazing applause I'm totally gonna get when I'm done with this. This is gonna be really great.  [00:09:24] Speaker 2: It was Sidzie. I looked Clyde out, so I went Clyde had to go out really bad. He's, asked me to go  [00:09:29] User: out. He asked me. Whatever.  [00:09:31] Speaker 2: He begged to go out. So glad  [00:09:33] Speaker 1: you're here. Even if it's for the academic bribery, he needs to be extra credit. Is it a lot of time times, we have discussions about race on campus, and I've been doing this work for  [00:09:43] Speaker 2: a long time. Okay.

Hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag microaggressions define microaggressions refer to the everyday verbal and nonverbal flight in intent from the perpetrator. They can be directed toward individuals from marginalized groups and may be subtle, but detrimental in their cumulative effect. As described by the Cleveland Clinic, microaggressions can undermine an individual stereotypes. For instance, comments like, you speak English well for someone from your background Euro implicitly suggest that the recipient is not truly part of the dominant culture in validating their identity. These seemingly innocuous remarks can contribute to an environment of exclusion, causing emotional distress over time. A kid to death by a 1,000 cuts. Hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag the concept of internalized racism, internalized racism occurs when marginalized individuals adopt the beliefs and attitudes of the dominant culture regarding their own racial groups. This internalization of prejudice leads to an evaluation of 1 by identity and community. For example, individuals may feel shame about their heritage or believe that they must conform to dominant societal standards to be accepted. Scholars have documented how internalized racism can manifest through self hatred, denial of cultural identity, and the adoption of negative stereotypes about group. Internalized racism can have severe implications for mental health as it is associated with feelings of depression, low self esteem and anxiety. Hashtag, hashtag, hashtag, hashtag, hashtag, bulk consciousness and its role of false consciousness, a concept originally rooted in Mark theory, describes the state where oppressed groups hold distorted beliefs that obscure their understanding of their oppression. This phenomenon allows systemic inequalities to persist because those affected may internalize the values and ideologies of the ruling classes, leading to behaviors that reinforce their inferior status. In the context of race, false consciousness can lead individuals from marginalized communities to support and perpetuate stereotypes against their group.

Subsequently, they may exhibit behaviors reflecting these in internalized biases, further perpetuating stereotypes within their own communities.

Moreover, false consciousness allows these harmful beliefs to persist under my To challenge the cycle, is crucial to promote awareness and foster environments where diverse identities are celebrated and respected, enabling a collective resistance against oppressive structures. Recognizing the subtle but significant impacts of these concepts is essential for creating a more equitable society.",     "[00:16:00] Speaker 1: Recognizing internalized racism, a path to awareness and change internalized racism is a phenomenon that affects individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic group. Leading them to adopt the negative beliefs and stereotypes that the dominant culture holds. This internalization often results in feelings of shame, confusion, and disconnection from one's cultural identity. Recognizing one's own internalized racism is an essential toward healing and promoting a healthier sense of self and community. This essay outlines several strategies individuals can use to identify internalized racism within themselves and begin the journey toward personal and communal transformation. Engaging in self reflection self reflection is a critical process for identifying internalized racism. Individuals should take time to examine their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors concerning race and identity. Questions to consider include, how do I perceive my own racial or ethnic group? Do I hold biases against my group or feel ashamed of my heritage? Reflecting on these questions can help reveal the internal conflicts and negative beliefs that may have been internalized over time. Self reflection can also involve journaling experiences and feelings associated with race. Capturing insights that may arise in everyday encounters or reflecting on family and community narratives about race. Seeking education and diverse perspectives, another effective way to recognize Educating oneself about the history of systemic racism cultural oppression, and the significance of one's racial identity can provide context for personal experiences. This educational process can include reading literature authored by individuals from one's cultural background, engaging with scholarly articles that analyze internalized racism, and consuming media that challenge dominant cultural narratives. Understanding the broader social context of racism can help individuals identify the specific instances of internalized racism they may exhibit. Furthermore, exposure to diverse perspectives can enrich one's understanding of their identity and the complexities associated with it, thus promoting a healthier self-concept. Understanding implicit bias and microaggressions individuals often unconsciously exhibit exhibit biases that reflect internalized racism. Recognizing these implicit biases may require individuals to reflect on their reactions to people of different races and their language use. For example, awareness of whether one feels more comfortable with certain racial groups or unconsciously makes assumptions about others based on appearances can illuminate internalized stereotypes. Engaging in activities such as implicit bias tests can help uncover these subconscious beliefs and highlight areas needing change. Additionally, it is important to recognize microaggressions, subtle, often remarks or behaviors that convey discrimination. Individuals can reflect on experiences where they may have either perpetrated or internalized microaggressions, resulting in shame or defensiveness about their own identity. By acknowledging these moments, can start to understand how deeply ingrained societal prejudices can infect personal Asking for feedback from trusted individuals, another practical approach to recognizing internalized racism is seeking feedback from close friends, family member, or trusted mentors. Engaging in honest, open discussions about race can provide invaluable insight insights into how one's attitudes and actions may reflect internalized racism. This external perspective allows for a more rounded view of one's behaviors and thoughts toward race and culture. It is essential to approach such conversations with Common examples of microaggressions that often go unrecognized and directed at marginalized groups.",     "[00:35:00] Speaker 1: They may seem innocuous or trivial to the perpetrator or even bystanders. But they carry a weight that can accumulate and lead to significant distress for the recipient. Understanding these microaggressions is crucial for fostering a more environment. This essay explores some common examples that people might not readily recognize. Assumptions about intelligence. One prevalent form of microaggression involves making assumptions about someone's intelligence based on their race or ethnicity. For instance, comments like, you speak English so well, can imply that the person, likely a person of color, is not expected to be proficient in English, which echoes stereotypes about immigrants and their capabilities. Similarly, when people of color are told they are not like other, group. 340. The compliment that is in people may offer compliments that inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes or biases.",     "[00:41:00] Speaker 1: For example, saying you're pretty for a black girl or you're very articulate for a Latina may sound like praise, but it reinforces the idea that individuals of these backgrounds are generally not expected to meet those standards. 61 These comments not only objectify the individuals, but also imply that their racial identity has a negative connotation that can be offset only by their personal attributes. Tokenism Another frequent microaggression is which occurs when individuals of marginalized background are invited into discussions or settings primarily to meet diversity quotas. Expressions like you're so diverse, or I love how you bring a different perspective can be patronizing and may contribute to feeling of being used as a symbol rather than valued for genuine contribution. This trivialization can communicate to the individual that their identity is a mere accessory in a predominantly homogeneous environment. Questioning experiences, dismissing or questioning someone's lived experiences can also manifest as a microaggression. Phrases like I don't see color or that does they are their realities are exaggerated. This denial fails to recognize persistent issues of systemic racism and can leave the recipient feeling marginalized or isolated in their experiences. Stereotypical humor making jokes about someone's cultural background is another common yet unrecognized microaggression. Such comments may include asking a person of Asian descent to help with math using the phrase that's so gay as an in These jokes minimize and reinforce harmful stereotypes, allowing pervasive cultural biases to thrive thrive while the humor deflects genuine discussions about racism and inequality. Gendered assumptions individuals often experience microaggression related to gender as well. Statements like should smile more directed at women can discount their emotional states, suggesting that there were is tied to their appearance and demeanor. 8. Similarly, addressing women in professional settings with terms of endearment like sweet heart or honey undermines their professionalism and competence. Reducing their identity to gender based stereotypes. Invasion of personal space in many situations, particularly for women and large marginalized individuals, physical space is encroached upon without permission. Comments or behavior like touching someone without consent consent or man spreading where a man occupies more space than necessary, can signal a lack of respect for personal boundaries. These actions can send implicit messages about superiority and entitlement. Conclusion microaggressions can significantly impact the well-being of individuals, creating an environment of distrust and emotional among marginalized groups. Often unrecognized by those who perpetrate them these subtle slights can accumulate into a tangible burden for the recipient. Awareness is the first step toward change. Through education and acknowledgment of these behaviors, individuals can foster a more respectful, inclusive, and equitable environment for everyone.

As we navigate our bond together, it is essential to grapple with the external pressures imposed by a capitalist society. These forces often create barriers that obscure the authenticity of our feelings, urging us to evaluate our love through the lens of expectations. This letter seeks to explore how capitalism infiltrates our intimate lives, leading to a distortion of what love truly means. The commodification of love love in our contemporary context is often viewed as a commodity. It becomes something to be acquired, traded, or even lost. Capitalist ideologies promote the notion that relationships offer a return on investment. Partners need to fulfill specific roles, emotional, sexual, and  [00:01:15] User: economic,  [00:01:16] Speaker 1: and meet our ever growing expectations. This commodification creates pressure to demonstrate affection through material means rather than genuine emotional connection. We find ourselves caught in a web of societal expectations, seeking to impress each other with gifts and extravagant dates instead of simply cherishing the time we spend together. The illusion of scarcity capitalism cultivates an illusion of scarcity when it comes to love and potential partners. We are conditioned to believe that there are limited opportunities for lasting connections, which leads to a competitive mindset in our relationship. The belief in finding the one amplifies this feeling of scarcity, making it seem as though true love is a rare commodity. Consequently, we may settle relationships that do not nurture our inner selves, driven by fear of being left behind in a capitalist society that romanticizes the idea of permanent partnerships. The impact of financial pressure, moreover, financial pressure exert a significant toll on relationships. Reports indicate that struggles surrounding finance, with rising costs of living and economic precarity marking our existence, it becomes challenging to maintain the emotional intimacy we desire while managing the practical aspects of life. The daily grind demands so much of our time and energy that it inevitably affects the quality bond, us further apart even as we strive for closeness. Cultivating meaningful connections nonetheless amidst the  [00:02:30] Speaker 2: looming influence of cow  [00:02:32] Speaker 1: capitalism, there remains a pathway to cultivate authentic love. Challenging the ingrained notions of commodification and scarcity, can embrace a view of love that transcends transactional expectations. Real love flourishes in the depths of our shared experiences where vulnerability, communication, and empathy take precedence over materialism. Alain De Bottin Upland notes that love must be about mutual recognition and the will willingness to coexist with one another's imperfections rather than fulfilling unrealistic expectations that are often imposed by societal standards. A conscious love as we traverse our journey together I wish to remind us of the beauty lying in our connection that exists beyond societal pressure. Love in all its messiness cannot be neatly packaged into a conventional capitalist framework. It requires courage to confront and dismantle these imposition yet it nurtures an environment where both of us can grow independent from the temporal needs fueled by capitalism. Together, let us cultivate a love that resists the pressure cherishing our shared moments free from the confines of outside expectations. Embracing love with consciousness turns our relationship into a sanctuary, allowing it to thrive amid the noise of capitalism. This, dear one, is the foundation of our love, a place where we recognize love not as a product to possess, but as an evolving journey that demands patience, understanding, and authenticity.  [00:04:01] User: Internalized racism and oppression. Relation to false consciousness from a leftist perspective and social phenomenon wherein individuals from marginalized racial groups embrace an  [00:04:15] Speaker 3: perpetuate the negative perceptions and stereotypes imposed by  [00:04:17] User: a  [00:04:18] Speaker 2: dominant culture. This  [00:04:19] Speaker 3: concept suggests that the systemic oppression faced by these groups leads to an internalization of inferiority, shaping their beliefs, actions, and interactions within society. From a leftist perspective, internalized racism becomes tightly intertwined with the notion of false consciousness, which refers to a misrecognition of one's real social conditions and interests due to dominant ideological forces. This essay will explore the connection between internalized racism and false con, demonstrating how systemic racial oppression fosters a cycle of self-devaluation and collective disempowerment. Defining internalized racism and its mechanisms, internalized racism can be defined as the process by which racially subordinated individuals accept the beliefs, values, and norms propagated by the dominant racial group, leading to a devaluation of their own identities and cultures. This phenomenon is not merely a result of personal failures or individual choice. It operates within a broader context of systemic oppression. For instance, the internalization of negative stereotypes results in individuals rejecting their racial identity, engaging in behaviors such as skin whitening, or adopting Eurocentric beauty standards. According to sociologist Karen DeeDee Pike, this internalization reflects both conscious and unconscious acceptance of a racial hierarchy, wherein individuals perceive the dominant culture as superior and adopt its values at the expense of their own cultural heritage. False consciousness, a leftist framework, the concept of false consciousness stems from Marxist theory, whereby members of the oppressed classes misinterpret their interests due to the ideological dominance of the ruling class. This misrecognition leads individuals to internalize the values that uphold their subordination, resulting in a systematic misrepresentation of their true social conditions. Consequently, false consciousness contributes to the continued existence of inequalities as individuals do not recognize the mechanisms of their oppression, believing instead that they have agency within a system that is fundamentally designed to disadvantage them. In the context of internalized racism, false consciousness becomes particularly relevant as individuals from marginalized groups often fail to recognize their collective oppression. They may adhere to the belief that their social and economic struggles stem from personal failures rather than systemic issues. This idea blindness prevents them from recognizing the shared nature of their experiences and the need for structural change. As noted by cultural theorists, such misrecognition perpetuates a cycle. When individuals internalize racist ideologies, they not only harm themselves, but also contribute to the fabric that maintains these oppressive structures. The interplay between unconscious bias and structural oppression internally. The mechanisms of racism operate through both interpersonal and systemic channels. In many instances, individuals develop a sense of shame regarding their racial identities, which can manifest in behaviors reflecting self-hatred. This shame is fostered by societal narratives that position whiteness as the standard, creating a cognitive dissonance for those who identify with a marginalized racial or ethnic. From a leftist viewpoint, these internal conflicts highlight how capitalism and systemic racism work together to reinforce false consciousness.  [00:08:05] Speaker 0: Structures that marginalize them. Implications for collective action and social change underscores the importance of collective action among marginalized groups. Efforts to combat internalized racism can facilitate a broad understanding of systemic oppression, motivating individuals to challenge the status quo. For example, cultural movements that celebrate racial identity and challenge the societal imposition of inferiority have been effective in fostering resilience and empowerment within communities. Unlearning  [00:09:00] Speaker 1: the internalized beliefs that perpetuate their oppression is essential. By collectively exploring shared experiences of racism, individuals can break free from false consciousness and begin to understand their positions within a broader socioeconomic and political context.  [00:09:25] Speaker 0: And confronting false consciousness are essential steps toward not only individual healing, but also achieving collective liberation and transformative the sociopolitical landscape, to challenge ingrained systems of discrimination.

[03:39] Speaker 1: So, like, if I saw somebody, like, Like somebody like a dude assaulting a chick in the street.  [03:45] Speaker 2: But that wouldn't happen because patriarchy is part of this system of dominance. Nation. I  [03:50] Speaker 1: mean, I'm  [03:51] Speaker 2: just That's the only reason why that wouldn't even be a thing.

Like, a a better example, like, if somebody somebody a lot bigger than the person that they're beating up was beating up somebody a  [04:24] Speaker 2: lot smaller than them. Why would they be beating each other up,  [04:28] User: though?  [04:29] Speaker 2: But that's also a power dynamic. But why would they  [04:32] Speaker 1: But, like, Lay.

[04:42] Speaker 2: What today, why what reasons do people beat other people up for?  [04:46] Speaker 1: Fucking things that they consider property. Okay. Like  [04:50] Speaker 2: So yeah. Property for  [04:52] Speaker 1: the relationship or looking material.  [04:54] Speaker 2: Yeah. Keeping things for yourself. It's all for you. It's all individualist. Type of thinking. It's all about the individual and stuff. Mhmm. That's domination also. But, yeah, But in in if we didn't have this, like, individualist mindset where we just care about ourselves then there would be no beating people up over property. Everybody would have what they need. That's the idea. Not more than they need, and it's not even about once. Once, I don't even know like, I don't I don't know. Can't really I don't know what to say about once. But needs, as far as needs, meaning a place a home.  [05:30] Speaker 3: I  [05:31] Speaker 1: mean, if everybody had their needs met, their wants would be far like, lesser.  [05:35] Speaker 2: Yeah. Exactly. The only and most of our wants are only for things such as status, or power or, you know, just like  [05:43] Speaker 1: Should that doesn't actually mean anything.  [05:45] Speaker 2: Yeah. Exactly. And that like these things these wants are superficial. Mhmm.  [05:50] Speaker 1: We  [05:51] Speaker 2: only want them because it puts us higher up than others.  [05:55] Speaker 0: Yeah. We have bounds. It's not  [05:57] Speaker 1: a lot of you,  [05:58] Speaker 0: babe.  [06:00] Speaker 1: Heard. But.  [06:01] Speaker 0: But  [06:02] Speaker 1: We  [06:03] Speaker 0: already don't have, like, a lot. So, and we don't want it. So well, we don't want it for obvious So these I mean, Whatever. So then we're able to we are more able to Have to love without those bounds than other people with more.  [06:21] Speaker 1: does squarely. Does  [06:23] User: that really? That's smoke.

[00:02:15] Speaker 1: I don't know how many I think balance box only bought 1  [00:02:18] Speaker 5: Let me see. I  [00:02:20] Speaker 4: don't know if she bought 5521 about 5, 6 bites. She won 5 lost one. Everybody should follow with this.  [00:02:25] Speaker 2: Gotcha. Okay. Well, there's, okay.  [00:02:27] Speaker 4: For another example,  [00:02:28] Speaker 2: take away boxing, you know, physical sports like that. What about, like, powerlifting, weightlifting, things like that that men are just naturally better at because they're getting more testosterone. Yep.  [00:02:35] Speaker 1: There was a trans woman who got into the deal with it.  [00:02:38] Speaker 4: Gentleman. Was it was it my way around?  [00:02:41] Speaker 1: Was it by weight loss? I'm I'm not sure, but should be enough.  [00:02:44] Speaker 2: Well, I mean, either way, there's really that men wouldn't have separate It's themselves.  [00:02:48] Speaker 1: In, However, based on 57 2 plus years of, hormone treatment. Would not  [00:02:53] Speaker 4: like, a  [00:02:54] Speaker 1: like an impact sequentially level. That's why it's short. Arena. Most sporting places do have requirements. I think that if you're competing in high school, I don't bear I don't need a requirement.  [00:03:03] Speaker 2: School should be a purple thing as well. Like, I think we shouldn't have sports style. It's all been kind of a different scholarship for sports. I mean, I think  [00:03:10] Speaker 1: sports should be totally High School. And then when you're out of high school, college, I think, is fine to have requirements. To professional sports is fine. Our requirements. It's a nuanced conversation. So I think we should have requirements based on the software levels and things like that. But I also think all sports in general should be that way. I think all sports should be Oh, wait. It's just based on,  [00:03:34] Speaker 2: the  [00:03:35] Speaker 1: different biological metrics  [00:03:37] Speaker 4: Okay.  [00:03:39] Speaker 2: I I I mean, I I disagree with, I think, I mean, if you there's no woman on the face of the earth that could play in the NFL. I mean, other than, like, maybe a kicker, but we've seen the women try to kick in the NFL and college  [00:03:55] Speaker 4: and  [00:03:56] Speaker 2: it's just it it just doesn't work. I I would never be there. Claim there is no woman to to compete the NFL. I think that's a claim that's impossible to  [00:04:05] Speaker 3: sustain. He's done violence  [00:04:06] Speaker 4: In short, we need  [00:04:08] Speaker 3: to wear those vice that converts energy into useful work.  [00:04:11] User: What you doing? Hello?

It's  [00:00:02] Speaker 1: Back up. Clyde, Go down. While Go lay down.  [00:00:05] User: Henry Geld  [00:00:06] Speaker 1: in his victory, saying that he will be going after other members And costs a lot of money to do it. But we have to straighten out the press. Our press is very corrupt. And bemoaned the back that his justice department would do it for him, which is perhaps a harbinger of what he will be expecting. In his second regime. But these chilling words were followed by action. And  [00:00:30] User: you  [00:00:31] Speaker 2: say his second  [00:00:32] Speaker 1: enough,  [00:00:33] Speaker 3: the next day, I Yeah. Actually, I told you I think it's been she called it  [00:00:36] Speaker 1: Against the day moyed register in the pollster and sells our over pull the choke. Kamala Harris ahead in Iowa. The weekend before the election. The poll had shown  [00:00:49] Speaker 3: what  [00:00:50] Speaker 1: was ahead, but during the actual exit, Trump won the state's handlers. Ironically, the same pollster, Anne, was known to be one of the most accurate and who you  [00:01:01] Speaker 2: are  [00:01:02] User: fully  [00:01:03] Speaker 3: fucking I can't even Has the has the  [00:01:06] Speaker 1: Polls Notice shifts in public  [00:01:08] User: opinion.

He said that it's a form of election interference, the absurdity of it all. But he feels emboldened. Because people are kissing the ring and trying to curry favor. I thought one of the most telling disturbing in a way Close that he said, No. That's not what it is. We just had it's a sad statement that the most powerful are obeying in advance. Corporate executives, members of our media obeyed in advance  [00:01:54] Speaker 3: and leaving the orange Why obeying at all? What does that even mean? I wanna point out that America is free country.  [00:02:01] Speaker 1: FBI director Christopher Wray announced he would resign before Trump took office. Reason this  [00:02:06] Speaker 2: bag  [00:02:07] Speaker 1: is  [00:02:08] Speaker 2: and it's  [00:02:09] Speaker 1: atypical is  [00:02:10] Speaker 3: this particular office Go. Sorry. Go. Go.

[00:03:23] Speaker 3: Shit. Good little  [00:03:24] Speaker 2: shit.  [00:03:26] User: Why not?  [00:03:27] Speaker 1: So you're facing put back push back as we've discussed. Trump loyalist who ran in Arizona for governor and senate. No. Los Angeles. On tried to fight both and said there was, you know, something wrong with the election in her state, a real nut job. She is now going to be the director of Voice of America.  [00:03:44] Speaker 4: A  [00:03:45] Speaker 1: federally funded broadcaster.  [00:03:47] Speaker 3: I don't know who that is.  [00:03:48] Speaker 1: That's long. That holds Not too stripy. That's not even really a That's like  [00:03:53] User: surprising or, like,  [00:03:54] Speaker 2: weird  [00:03:55] Speaker 1: Like I said, the fish now would be personally. Now would that the cheap and worldwide. In charge of that The extra voice of America. That was in the other  [00:04:03] User: oh, wait. Never mind. That's not the one. I was thinking of that's voice of America's propaganda except I read at all,  [00:04:09] Speaker 3: really. Oh,  [00:04:10] Speaker 1: great.  [00:04:11] Speaker 3: I don't know. Just some cuckoo person that's all I know. Yeah. Exactly. I know.  [00:04:15] Speaker 1: Yeah. That's why I told you all, you know, rest up now.  [00:04:18] Speaker 4: Because I've  [00:04:19] Speaker 3: had to see what's describing them. I'm just saying, like, I got the gist was that, like, this person  [00:04:22] Speaker 4: is  [00:04:23] Speaker 3: a cry. Person or, you know, had some sort of, like, I just assumed that's what she's talking about because you weren't you were talking about them being a good person. If you're supposed to be in a positive  [00:04:29] Speaker 1: in a way positive. And that is even though we don't really have a way to fight back per se yet. And so I told you all, you know, rest up now, follow what's going on, but give yourself space to breathe. It's okay to tune out. You can catch up on all you need by reading the weekly list, listening to the podcast, the podcast, the the big thing for the big thing. Of our just current and and former law enforcement a, announce he would resign before Trump took office. The reason this matters, and it is atypical, Is this particular office is supposed to be apolitical. It's a 10 year appointment. Trump is the one that actually appointed Ray. And Biden left him in place. Because they're supposed to term serve a 10 year appointment regardless of who is president. Current and former law enforcement officials called the resignation unwelcome and worrisome and an ominous sign. Richard Blumenthal, who's a Democrat, called it a, quote, threat to the independence and integrity of our justice department. Trump also is continuing to close rail nutshots into cabinet positions. He is facing put back pushback as we've discussed. But also on the theme of media, he picked Carrie Lake, an election denier  [00:05:39] Speaker 4: in  [00:05:40] Speaker 3: front of Oh my god. Yes. We have.  [00:05:42] Speaker 2: In  [00:05:43] Speaker 3: Arizona. Great  [00:05:44] Speaker 4: person.  [00:05:45] User: It's  [00:05:46] Speaker 1: said it.  [00:05:47] Speaker 3: Yes. Yes. She was denying her own election result when she lost. There was, you know, something wrong with the comes slogan, like, you know, like, whatever he was doing. Voice  [00:06:01] Speaker 1: of America.  [00:06:03] Speaker 3: Yeah. She's a cuckoo.  [00:06:05] Speaker 1: Trump has long sought to strip the agency of its independence during his 1st regime. And Lake said the mission now would be chronicling America achievement worldwide, which is not the actual mission. A  [00:06:12] Speaker 3: voice of a but  [00:06:14] Speaker 1: that was another note worthy  [00:06:17] Speaker 3: But does it about shit. See, I There's also a part of my house where, like, the  [00:06:20] Speaker 1: conflicts  [00:06:21] Speaker 4: of  [00:06:22] Speaker 1: interest  [00:06:23] Speaker 4: in  [00:06:24] Speaker 1: this  [00:06:25] Speaker 2: week's  [00:06:26] Speaker 1: list. You can catch up by reading it all. But I wanna close off on a pause That is  [00:06:31] Speaker 3: I can tell she's she. No. She's very Like, what Voice of America is bad.  [00:06:35] Speaker 2: It's a  [00:06:36] Speaker 3: bad agency anyways, like, this spreading propaganda.  [00:06:39] Speaker 2: Mhmm.  [00:06:40] Speaker 4: And  [00:06:41] Speaker 3: whatever. So for her to be, like, just saying like, oh, this is gonna be you know, that's not what the mission of Voice of America is, and then just, like, it's like I mean, I don't know. I feel like it's like a that's the wrong argument. Okay? The argument should be this is a propaganda freaking agency that just fucking, like, does harm or whatever. Like, it just needs to go instead of we need the right person in charge of our propaganda machine. Like rice? Uh-huh. But  [00:07:07] Speaker 2: I  [00:07:08] Speaker 4: imagine  [00:07:09] Speaker 2: just based on the fact that she didn't suggest, like, ending that fucking deal Mhmm. That it's gonna be it's gonna exist regardless.  [00:07:17] Speaker 3: I didn't think it was gonna get written, but what do you mean? They're like I know I know they're not gonna get rid of it. That's what I said. You can't, like, expect them to do something that benefits them. Or do something, that would change what something that benefits them.  [00:07:28] Speaker 2: So if they're not gonna get rid of it, wouldn't the best option be to have somebody that's Not 2 feet away from you?  [00:07:34] Speaker 3: My point was that the wrong argument isn't I was saying  [00:07:37] User: never mind. I don't know. I guess it doesn't  [00:07:39] Speaker 3: The fact that she didn't say anything about it being bad means that she doesn't necessarily think it's bad. She just wants to write wants to not hook up person running it. I'm saying most people, if they when they hear this voice of America, they don't understand, like, what it is and what it does. So just leaving that out. I'm talking about talking about, like, well, he said he was gonna make it, like, spread the spread the the American whatever bullshit that that's what Trump said he's it already does. So it was just it's it's as if, like, when the when certain people do it, it's okay. Even though, like, I  [00:08:04] Speaker 4: don't know.  [00:08:05] Speaker 3: She's naive. And also, she benefits from the system the way that she has lots of money. I don't know exactly who she is, like, but she's some prominent person in way. I mean, she's an advocate. I mean, like I said, I take everything with a grain of salt. There's very few  [00:08:21] Speaker 4: people  [00:08:22] Speaker 3: who I think are kinda, like, unquestion not unquestionable, but haven't given me any reason to doubt them. As far as people that we've listened to for anything or that I listen to. Like,  [00:08:29] User: I mean, I  [00:08:30] Speaker 3: but I've been even by those people, I've been disappointed many times.  [00:08:34] Speaker 5: When are you  [00:08:35] Speaker 4: okay?  [00:08:36] Speaker 2: No. It's horrible.  [00:08:37] Speaker 4: Mhmm.  [00:08:38] Speaker 2: Like, I don't know what happened to the food on my plate.  [00:08:40] User: Green, it's too oily or something. Green. Too oily or something.  [00:08:43] Speaker 2: Maybe it's because you can't do  [00:08:45] Speaker 3: it.

World peace is like more like there's no like Mass, like, terror or any kind of, like, yeah. Just violence on a mass level or whatever, I guess. But also even still, no. I think no. I don't I don't agree with you, like, at all. Like, as far as world peace goes, you go being impossible. So you're saying that there will always be wars of against an amongst nations and states and stuff? Conflict. I was that's what I'm asking you. I just asked you. I'm I'm just  [00:20:17] Speaker 1: saying there will always be conflict.  [00:20:19] User: Oh, okay. So you're yes, there would always be violence amongst nations. Right? For whatever reason, greed, whatever. Right?  [00:20:23] Speaker 1: I believe there will always be violence on some level.  [00:20:26] User: Yeah. So that's the s in links, nations, and states. Right? I'm not saying I'm not just talking about individual, like, issues. I don't even think I almost don't even think that that's a thing where there will be there will still be suffering no matter what, because because that's how that's the nature of just, like, living. There will be suffering, and You know? Nothing you can do about that. But that's not necessarily not peace, I guess. It's just Yeah. But for sure, no. I disagree totally that there cannot be no world peace. Truly, I disagree. Because the only reason why there's not now is because of The like, a system that has to withhold or uphold or whatever. By being I mean, that's the only reason why violence is the same now.  [00:21:10] Speaker 1: You can do a peace in the United States.  [00:21:12] User: There is.

But it can absolutely happen. Okay. But thought you're saying that you don't think it's possible. Like, I didn't, like, it's some sort of, like, in our nature thing to, like, not be get along kind of thing and be, helpful or whatever. Each  [00:21:40] Speaker 1: other versus  [00:21:42] User: killing each  [00:21:43] Speaker 1: other. I think that violence is a part of  [00:21:46] User: It's not, by the way, but okay.

[00:01:41] Speaker 2: You just want me to be happy whenever I don't I want to get through this. I don't wanna keep doing this. Or, like, when you tell me that you love me  [00:01:48] Speaker 1: love.  [00:01:49] Speaker 2: That's not Like, as if in in the wrong moment. I'm not saying that you can't love me, but just telling me that you love me in the moment where I am asking you for more you to show me Is It's hurtful to me.  [00:02:01] Speaker 1: It it's just, like, how I, I approach you. Like, that's how I fucking step up to the plate. That's not me swinging.  [00:02:06] Speaker 2: Brian. Do you think I know that that's not, like, understand that's how you do it, but that's also how you just avoid being uncomfortable though is what  [00:02:12] User: I'm saying.  [00:02:13] Speaker 1: It's it's not me avoiding being uncomfortable because, like, It's it was uncomfortable uncomfortable for me to, like, even, like, try to fucking, like, like, approach you at that moment. Like, it was like, I I could've fucking stayed out here and just been, like, I'm gonna be sad in my fucking ice cream. By myself.

Like, where I'm not saying the fucking that everything it's like, it like, the fight is over or whatever the just move forward from here, blah blah blah. I'm not that's not what I was going for. Because I know that that is  [00:02:45] Speaker 2: So what did you what were you planning on doing your planning on going to offer me ice cream and trying to make me smile, and then what? You wanna And then you would try to get back into it? Like, fucking  [00:02:53] Speaker 1: yeah. Try and fucking reestablish some former fucking solid ground.  [00:02:57] Speaker 2: But we have to do like, I don't I mean, it's not a thing where, like, we do it later. We have to address it when it happens. So I know I know  [00:03:03] Speaker 1: gonna have the  [00:03:04] Speaker 2: discussion overall. I mean, you say well, don't know. It's I mean, you brought the ice cream. That was that was a piece of bread. That was that was that was fine. I thought that was perfectly fine, but then if you like, just asking me to smile a moment where I'm like, I guess, like  [00:03:17] Speaker 1: I took too long to fucking get my motives out. They're fucking I did want to  [00:03:20] Speaker 2: No, babe. I'm not saying you did anything wrong there. No. I What I'm saying is I'm like, in those situations, I didn't smile, not smiling because I'm just telling you like when you want me to smile and I don't smile, I feel like I His just acting like or now he's gonna just use this against me and act like I just want to be mad. Or whatever. Whenever I feel like it's just you're not taking it seriously. And But regardless, that's not even that's nothing you need to fight about there. I get it. I do know I know why why you do it. But  [00:03:46] Speaker 1: You're not supposed to chew ice cream with your teeth, babe.  [00:03:49] Speaker 2: Please allow 1  [00:03:50] Speaker 1: here.

Like, fucking splitting having them split into white and black groups and then, like, practice what slavery would have felt like kind of thing. That kind of  [00:06:43] Speaker 1: shit. That's like that's like the fucking the Stanford fucking prison experiment, but, like, way fucking worse.  [00:06:49] Speaker 3: Like, kids doing this? Yeah. Yeah. But it's I don't I don't know what that was. That's when they  [00:06:54] Speaker 1: had fucking 2 groups 1 group was the jailers. 1 group was the prisoners.  [00:06:58] Speaker 3: It was is it separated by race? No. Okay.  [00:07:01] Speaker 5: That's what I was  [00:07:02] Speaker 1: saying. Like, it's so much worse. That your your claim is so much worse. But, it was, like, to show, like, power dynamics and  [00:07:08] Speaker 5: and,  [00:07:09] Speaker 3: That makes sense.  [00:07:11] Speaker 1: How fucking absolute power corrupts absolutely. And fucking, like, I I've I've heard I've heard 2 different fucking things because, like, in the in the psych in my psych one, my one  [00:07:19] Speaker 5: was  [00:07:20] Speaker 1: they fucking gave, like, all credence to it and knew know, said it was a, like, legitimate happening. They actually did conduct those experiments. And, and then after after the first after group 1 was a jailers, group 2 was a prisoners, Group 2 was the jail age, and then group 1 Yeah. And fucking I I wanna say that fucking the second run, was worse than the first. Because the jail the jailers then having the experience as the prisoners fucking invoked  [00:07:43] Speaker 0: That's always will just like show you and like like, show you, like, the research, do all these studies, But I'm, like, what the like, why  [00:07:50] Speaker 1: are you on  [00:07:51] Speaker 0: the  [00:07:52] Speaker 1: why do  [00:07:53] Speaker 0: you guys not ever ever fucking, like, talk about the why? It's like that? Yeah. Why do you guys never like, why is that not something you guys go over and talk about? And sometimes they do. A lot of times they do, but that part's never talked about. Like when whenever we get the abstract or whatever. There's a fucking, like, summary of it. They show us the they show us the study and  [00:08:09] Speaker 2: the comes before the experiment, doesn't it?  [00:08:11] Speaker 0: It just it's just, like, the summary part at the very beginning. It but it doesn't go over the fine the actual findings as to, like I don't know. Sometimes the actual, like, what it means, you know, Like, yeah. Sure. You can say all the data  [00:08:26] Speaker 1: and the trends, but you don't get the fucking  [00:08:29] User: Yeah. Exactly. You get the the the behavioral, like, facts and  [00:08:33] Speaker 0: Wow. I don't remember it being, like, looking, like, this big and open.  [00:08:37] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. They used the fish eye back in camera thing. Lens or whatever they do, and then they kinda do, like, a weird panoramic. Panoramic shot of it. But then, like, also do up and down panoramic shots so that they  [00:08:45] User: some Some sneaky realtor stuff that they do a lot. I mean, you tried going outside and taking a picture of the house like, they have pictures of the house. Well, I guess it had it would have to be that picture of this house trying to get the same picture of this house out Yeah. Yeah. We could do that. I don't know. Do we have any pictures of this house?

[00:00:11] Speaker 1: Him, the white guy himself said,  [00:00:14] Speaker 2: that it was something completely different than that, so you just made that part up in your head for some reason, What do you mean what happened before that? There's no anything that happens before that that anybody has ever seen. But you do have the white guy selling of it and you have the black guy selling of it.  [00:00:31] Speaker 0: Okay. Okay. What? I said okay. I'm not arguing with you. I said okay.  [00:00:36] Speaker 2: I didn't didn't mean  [00:00:38] User: Could be a white dude. You know? So it's 6 Look at his demeanor. That is not a whole contankery. Old man you're trying to, like, say that he's just a innocent guy stuck in the past, like, with his mentality kind of thing or whatever. Even know what that how that was even a defense. Regardless, I mean, so he's 67. He's perfectly, like, he knows exactly what he's saying and doing. He's not just an innocent old man, like really old man, veteran guy, whatever I mean. Like, looking at some black guy who's just being obnoxious crazy, and drawing all his attention to himself. He even said that that was abrasive as fuck. I've been  [00:01:15] Speaker 1: like, this is  [00:01:16] User: thing where black people just love to draw attention to themselves.  [00:01:19] Speaker 2: Like, I don't even know why you made that comment. That was racist. What? Because  [00:01:23] Speaker 1: you Will  [00:01:25] Speaker 3: you will you will you actually listen to me? Will you actually listen to me? I give my commentary on that? Because I have been around a lot of fucking black people I have. And In certain different situations, A lot of the times, they are they have been belligerently loud and obnoxious. Beg when? Like, watching a fucking basketball game or a fucking  [00:01:46] Speaker 2: Is this just a black people thing? Just black people  [00:01:49] Speaker 3: No. It's not just a black people thing.  [00:01:51] Speaker 2: Right. But then why? What do you mean? Do you mean it's just a people thing? Some people do this?  [00:01:56] Speaker 3: Yeah. Some people do this.  [00:01:58] Speaker 1: Okay.  [00:02:00] Speaker 2: There's only black and black people do it or what?  [00:02:02] Speaker 3: No. In my experience, it has happened I've seen Yeah. It's b black people that that do that More than Others, my personal experience.  [00:02:09] Speaker 2: Maybe you just don't like when black people do  [00:02:12] User: it.  [00:02:13] Speaker 3: Oh, no. I'm just why why do you why do you say shit like that? We're not yelling at each other anymore. I'm not yelling anymore. I'm I'm not yelling. Please don't yell at me.  [00:02:22] Speaker 2: Because I want you just to admit you are I don't know why you like are trying to like like, first of all, you're changing the subject. Already anyways. Why are you talking about like, why are you focused on this part right now? I just showed you the video. You don't have anything to say about that? Like, how how you fucking miss like, how you told me this story about something that didn't happen that way?  [00:02:45] Speaker 3: Okay. I haven't watched the video in a long time. I remember it Why do you remember it  [00:02:48] Speaker 2: that way?  [00:02:49] Speaker 3: I I can't I can't answer that.  [00:02:51] Speaker 2: I know why.  [00:02:52] Speaker 3: Why?  [00:02:53] Speaker 2: Because it is racism that makes us think this way. I said us. People, I I It doesn't matter if you're black. You can definitely be racist against black people being black. We're all taught the same thing. We're all taught the same, like, bullshit about just black people being bad. We're all taught it. And, yeah, internalizing it is a thing that happens when that's all you hear. I am I'm I have this same vibe with you over and over again. Again, and I'm tired of having it. I don't wanna have it. I don't even wanna fight with you about it, but you One of the it just always started to me calling you saying I'm calling you a racist and I'm not.  [00:03:27] Speaker 3: I am a victim of the things that I have been taught. The things that have been fucking placed in my fucking brain are still there. I apologize. I'm trying I'm trying. To fucking change that. I  [00:03:39] Speaker 2: am. But why are we fighting about it? I don't understand why it's so hard for you to just be like, I didn't think of it like that or what I don't even know. Like, I am not trying to make us against each other or put us against each other at all. I'm trying to just tell you something that you I that is bad for you to think. Don't understand what is wrong with me doing that. Do you think you you're saying you let me out of it. You've been taught these things. I  [00:04:01] Speaker 3: just said What what you're what you're trying to convey it's it's not bad. It's not inherently bad. It I don't even really truly disagree with it. But the way the way it comes out when we when we start fighting about it that's my that's what I object to.  [00:04:14] Speaker 2: But why do we start fighting about it, Brian?  [00:04:16] Speaker 3: Because I'll say some shit that fucking exemplifies the fucking brainwashing that has occurred in my entire fucking life that you have already fucking surpassed that I still am a victim of, and you talked to me, like, I'm fucking, like, incapable of getting past this shit. Like, I refuse to even try to get past this shit. Wait. When you fight me on it, of course that's  [00:04:36] User: what you're doing,  [00:04:37] Speaker 2: Brian. No. It's it's Why do you fight  [00:04:39] me  [00:04:40] Speaker 2: on it? I'm not fighting with you to be  [00:04:41] Speaker 0: It's about you. You were so insistent on that. And the reason I was asking you these questions was for you to to for you to have some self reflection and think about it. I was asking you questions. Wasn't accusing you of anything. You're the one who chose to answer the questions you chose you the way you did. I mean, why would you insist that you time. Maybe  [00:05:01] Speaker 1: it's Like maybe please.  [00:05:03] Speaker 2: Maybe it's because my dad was in fucking Vietnam. Maybe it's because I fucking I I'm trying to fucking like, sympathize or what the fuck ever with that. Maybe maybe it's because I fucking truly think that when a fucking person is Fucking being shot at trying to fucking survive and they fucking see past each other's fucking race and fucking get each other's back. Maybe I respect that ideal a fucking level that's fucking Fucking, just wrong, I guess. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  [00:05:34] User: I don't know what? What does that mean? So when Why does that mean you fight with me about it and not just like be it's like  [00:05:40] Speaker 3: like, think about what you're saying. I mean, like, do you think that people just because they were, like, in war together, where they were fighting other people that didn't do anything to them, that they could  [00:05:55] Speaker 1: Like,  [00:05:56] Speaker 3: now we also brainwashed by the system just as you have or I have or and everybody else has. Into hating other people, And you think of these things that are false? They're also victims whether or not sure. I'm not saying that they're just inherently bad people even though they were in war with these people, They were in war with these people fighting people who also didn't do anything to them. They were killing innocent people. I wanna believe that everybody do like, would never do this stuff to each other either. But it won't change if that's what we do. Do you think that there's a better way you could have responded to me instead of, like, pretending I had no valid point over and over again, like, by me asking you whether or not you really were saying it wasn't racist or is that really still what you believe?  [00:06:38] Speaker 2: This entire night, could have gone better. Senator Patrick. No. I'm going to answer the question. Like, I do believe that my reactions could have been better and the fucking this entire fucking negative track that we're on. Could have been avoided. Is that  [00:06:53] User: I know.  [00:06:54] Speaker 2: I know. I know. I'm just asking. Is is that that an answer to your  [00:06:58] Speaker 1: question? Not at  [00:07:00] User: all.  [00:07:01] Speaker 3: I asked you if there was some another way a better way you could have responded to me  [00:07:04] Speaker 2: Are you asking for that better way, like, an  [00:07:07] Speaker 1: There  [00:07:08] Speaker 2: denying  [00:07:09] Speaker 3: him being that you were denying there being a possibility it was racist.  [00:07:12] Speaker 2: No. I was not. I was acknowledging the possibility that he that the pa the possibility possibility that he isn't racist. Right. Hey. It does exist in the realm of possibility. Just like the possibility When I when I when I more likely possibility that he is racist. Both possibilities exist.  [00:07:31] Speaker 3: I wasn't even trying to say I I mean, the point really was that what he said was racist Whether or not he's a flaming racist or not is different. That's regardless of the fact that what he said was racist. But you just said to me that either, like, you Your behavior, whatever thing you could have done differently and it would have been a lot better, gone gone a  [00:07:51] Speaker 1: lot smoother  [00:07:53] Speaker 3: So then if it's not that, then what what do you think that it was that you did that was not right, or that you could've done better to, like, avoid the exact same Conflict. Like, what is it that you are even saying that you could've done better then?  [00:08:03] Speaker 2: I could've voiced the fucking harm. Recognizing both possibilities. Opposed to just trying to  [00:08:07] User: k.  [00:08:08] Speaker 3: That was my whole point, was that, no, it wasn't There wasn't both possibilities. The point was they you brought up this This story and I was trying to tell you that this is another instance of you bringing up a story where there's a black guy that's the bad guy and the white guy is the good guy.  [00:08:27] Speaker 2: I did not say either of them were the good guy or the bad guy. I think both of them were in the wrong.  [00:08:32] Speaker 3: Do you know what chastise means? Did you use it incorrectly? I wasn't I wasn't.  [00:08:35] Speaker 2: Was talking about fucking, like,  [00:08:37] User: What is chastise me? Do not  [00:08:39] Speaker 3: listen or, like, listen to  [00:08:41] Speaker 1: the point. Funniest  [00:08:43] Speaker 2: or funny and make But part of your saying  [00:08:45] Speaker 3: Unjustly,  [00:08:46] User: though. Punished. Or criticized.  [00:08:48] Speaker 2: Used the word wrong. Thank you for inviting me. Truly, I'm not fucking being sarcastic. I'm not bullshitting. I'm fucking being genuine here. I fucking did not know that that fucking unjustly was part of that definition. I straight up Did not fucking know that. I used the word completely wrong.  [00:09:06] User: I'm not saying that don't know for sure the  [00:09:08] Speaker 3: definition of that word, but it is always using that  [00:09:10] User: sense or most of the time it's used in that sense whenever you're talking about, like, when you're bringing up  [00:09:13] Speaker 3: in that context, Brian, it's the only way it could have meant was that he was unjustly criticized or attacked or whatever. I'm  [00:09:19] User: pretty sure it is usually, it means unjustly.  [00:09:22] Speaker 3: But the only in that context, the only way you could have meant that was that you thought it was unfair because the re the response was to me talking about a white man getting off on murdering a black dude on a subway. And you said, and then they wanna criticize Epic Beard man We're knocking out a black dude. Or whatever. That was that was what you said in response to me So I don't know how you're saying, like, in that context, you could have understood it to mean something differently. Are you telling me that's not, like, actually what you're, like, are you telling me I'm wrong?  [00:09:52] Speaker 2: No. You're not wrong. Like, I fucking like, my my entire that entire fucking train of thought is fucking stupid, wrong, and I shouldn't have fucking said it. Like, Well, you fucking I I Fucking thinking error. Like Do  [00:10:05] Speaker 3: you think that that's the issue that I have? You think that that's what I'm, like, upset with you about?  [00:10:08] Speaker 2: No. I think you're upset with me for not fucking thinking before I fucking say shit No. That's and then saying shit and then fucking have a remote fucking position to have even said it. And then fucking  [00:10:21] Speaker 0: Be open to, like, listening to a different perspective and, like, learning and learning things you've learned. Maybe. I I am open to it. What do you mean? That's that that whole thing was you not being open to accepting any other thing. You weren't so defensive about it that I was just I mean, I was just questioning your beliefs on that or your understanding on that. I didn't even see the video.  [00:10:45] Speaker 1: That's that's where I don't think that you that you that you're understanding my my position. Like, because I wasn't saying that he I wasn't claiming that he wasn't No. What I what I was trying to what I was trying to convey is that it is possible that he wasn't racist. It that, like, that possibility existed. I I wasn't outright saying the shit. I have no grounds for saying that he's not racist. I have no grounds for dude. Like, I don't.  [00:11:11] User: But but how was it a response to what I said then? I was talking about 1 person doing something horrible to another  [00:11:14] Speaker 1: person. Fucking there's no correlation. There's nothing to be fucking if if they weren't equal, that what was fucking stupid The fucking fact that that that shit happened in my fucking head, I can't even fucking explain.  [00:11:26] User: You called him epic beard man.  [00:11:28] Speaker 1: That's what the video is called on the on YouTube. I didn't make that shit up. I don't idolize this fucking dude.  [00:11:32] User: I would've said if I were  [00:11:33] Speaker 1: you,  [00:11:34] User: I would've said fucking racist white dude did this shit, not epic  [00:11:37] Speaker 2: beard man.  [00:11:38] Speaker 1: That's what that's what it  [00:11:39] Speaker 2: I know. I don't know him by this name, but the fact that that's what you call him. Is what I'm saying. And why would you not just say, oh, white dude or something? Like, why would that not be a thing? Like, why would it be a  [00:11:44] Speaker 1: I'm Because that's how I've Why is to  [00:11:46] Speaker 2: fucking  [00:11:47] Speaker 1: whenever I would show somebody else a fucking video, for not even fucking the analysis part of it, but for the fucking So, like, clown on the way the dude said fucking amber lamps when he said when he fucking says call the ambulance. Like, that's, like, the reason why I've I've watched that video multiple times. Is because fucking people have made other videos off of that fucking making fun of other songs like fucking Black Betty Fucking Woah, Black Betty and Yeah.  [00:12:12] Speaker 2: I I I get it. It's just that, like, those are all racist thing and people doing that kind of stuff though. So either you okay. Either you think that the guy was fucking you think that the whole situation was a racist interaction or not. I mean, I mean people get upset when people say things that are hurtful such as harkening back to, you know, how much to spit shy my shoes. You don't think that that's a justified reason for somebody to get upset? When they've been like sat here, I mean, they're still dealing with this shit today, They have, like, they're showing no fucking sense of, like, they're not, like, shown I mean, I just don't understand, like, how you can't, like, I mean, I get it. You wanna distance yourself from that. I don't, I mean, I get it.  [00:12:52] Speaker 1: But  [00:12:53] Speaker 2: you're not playing victim by empathizing with people. I mean, if you can imagine the people who are, like, who've not been able to get out of their fucking situations and not had any chance for upward, upward mobility, like your father, which is a good thing. It is a good thing. There's nothing wrong with that whatsoever. But everybody should be able to do that, but some people aren't. So just just act like a little Some people did it, and so they if they can't, then that's on them kind of thing. It's kinda like no because it is being done to them. It's not their fault. Regardless of how bad they are. It's fine. Like, I understand that there's like shitty people in those in areas of, like, in areas where there's a high number of black people, brown people, whatever, and they're living in poverty, living off of welfare, But these are all Band Aids and these are all like band aids and excuses for just fucking treating them like shit and like acting like they're the reasons for all of our problems. And their own But you remembered even a different story. Like a completely different story. And the one you remembered made it out, like, there was the antagonist and protagonist. And which one was which?  [00:13:43] Speaker 1: I think they were both antagonists.  [00:13:45] Speaker 2: Your story was not the story that actually played out though, Brian. I'm  [00:13:48] Speaker 1: telling you what I what I think of the situation. Having watched it just now,  [00:13:52] Speaker 2: I But that's not what we're talking about. I wanna talk about, like, what we were like, what the fight was about.  [00:13:55] Speaker 1: The fight was about me making an association that had no fucking they had no right to be associated.  [00:14:02] Speaker 2: I'm asking you to be, like, self Like, reflect on your way to, like, to tell me this story in a way that didn't actually happen and what that would mean if you said way, you said it that way.  [00:14:12] Speaker 1: It means that fucking I saw shit differently than how shit was. Correct?  [00:14:16] Speaker 2: Yes. You did, but I'm I'm you know what I'm asking you to do, not just say obviously, yeah. That's what I've said. But I wanna know, like, I'm trying to I'm trying to show you, Brian, because I don't want you to because I'm not trying to call you racist. I'm not trying to tell you you're racist. I don't think that you're racist at all. I'm trying to show you your your thinking, like, how you, like, think about things is actually It's harmful to, like, Think that way. Trying to show you what I mean every time I say that you always defend white people like, at the chance like any chance that you can, what would never jump on the chance to defend like, tell a story or talk about it story or talk about, like, the fact that black people are, like, dealing with white people other than yourself. You talk about experiencing racism a lot. I've never heard you talk about anybody else experiencing racism.  [00:15:01] Speaker 0: If you had to take all of the races That we are defined by and put them in a hierarchy how do you think society would place them?  [00:15:09] Speaker 1: Why do you call black and brown?  [00:15:12] Speaker 0: That's what I mean when I'm not trying to fight with you ever. When you say things and it's okay. I'm not I'm not mad at you for saying them. I mean, maybe I maybe I have, like, been Maybe I get, like, 2, like, I lose my fucking patience too soon or too like much more quickly now. But it's because I already know exactly what's where it's going and it already it goes there. There's no, like there's nothing different about it. I'm asking you questions and instead of like if you disagree if you truly disagree with me, then why don't you just ask me questions and try to convince me to think differently? Why don't you? Why does it not matter to you that I do think it's racist? If don't think it's I'm not saying you do because if you truly like, realize what I'm saying or, like, realize or Just know what you said. I'm just saying in those cases or, for example, like, If you think that I'm wrong, if I'm wrong, about you being wrong, convince me. Why don't you ask me questions? Make me challenge my own thinking or self reflect on my thinking. I want you to do that. I would I mean, I ask you questions all the time. Because I'm trying to understand and I'm trying to, like, I don't know. But It's a losing battle because if you don't if you can't answer a question, instead of thinking about why you can't answer it, you say, oh my god or Jesus Christ and then you get frustrated and you then it just goes downhill from there. And this is a pattern. This is a pattern. I'm talking about, like, the initial starting of the fights not when we're fighting the things that we do because we both yell at each other, we both cut each other off, we both, like, we both do those things, and that's whenever things get tense and tense, and they shouldn't it shouldn't get to that point. But that's why I wanna talk to you about these I, like, I'm  [00:16:30] Speaker 1: been trying to tell you and that I want to do. Is come to, like, this, like, understanding of what we, like, how we avoid getting to this, like, the point where we're, like, screaming at each other. And not listening at all, or cutting each other off, But in order to do that, we have to identify, like, what went wrong and what needed to be  [00:16:50] Speaker 1: different.  [00:16:51] Speaker 1: What should have been different? I mean, like, who did what wrong?  [00:16:54] User: And  [00:16:55] Speaker 1: I always come to the conclusion that it's me telling you how I feel. It's it  [00:16:58] Speaker 2: it's not It's not usually how you feel that puts me at ends it's it's I I recognize the lack of patience Like, whatever whenever I say something, like, that fucking doesn't jive, It like, the tension fucking drops It, like, immediately. Like,  [00:17:09] Speaker 1: I don't think this. I think that you just get defensive because you're trying to tell me right now that I can't just be tell you I literally was only asking you questions at first, Brian. That's it. I just asked you, like, I don't fucking know. I mean, I was not immediately like, impatient with you on this at all. I couldn't believe what you were telling me because it was the same old thing, and I don't like, I'm sorry. It is frustrating that I've tried to tell this so many times. But you always come to like this, you always have this story about how white people are being treated badly or how black people are just like being shitty to white people. Something like like you always you always have these stories and I've told tried to tell you this so many times and every time I do, But It it it ends up, like, horribly. Like, you don't care to, like, you don't you don't care to get my perspective You don't ask me questions and try to change my mind. But when I'm trying to make you self reflect, you get frustrated.  [00:18:05] Speaker 2: That's not true. Like, I do fucking care about your perspective. I do. But And, like,  [00:18:09] Speaker 1: But why do you not try like, then why wait. What do you mean? It's not that you don't if you do, then why did you not why you're not asking me questions to understand my perspective? You're saying you just understand. And that's the part that's the problem right there. That is a huge problem. I don't know, like, how you think that that's acceptable. But anything, but yet, I'm sitting here asking you questions, or you're being defensive. Stop it. I mean, stop. Stop. Stop it. Stop it.  [00:18:30] User: No. Stop it. Stop. Stop.  [00:18:31] Speaker 1: Oh my god. Stop. Hey, Hey, Is it a party  [00:18:34] Speaker 2: on. Go, buddy. Come on. Come on.

Does it matter to you that, it could that that kind of stuff is actually harmful and is actually racist? Or does that matter at all? Like, what if it is So it ranges. If  [00:08:15] Speaker 0: it is actually if it is actually racist, then I'm fucking wrong.  [00:08:18] Speaker 1: So but why give him the benefit of the doubt? Why not? Because it is racist. Because if he's racist, then there's there's harm. And if you're just getting the benefit of doubt and it is racist, then you're  [00:08:30] User: This is what I mean.

I  [00:11:32] Speaker 3: If your answer is, then nobody's got wasted and  [00:11:35] Speaker 4: was  [00:11:36] Speaker 2: a  [00:11:37] Speaker 3: young person can  [00:11:39] Speaker 4: be fucking racist.  [00:11:40] Speaker 3: No. I didn't ask. Didn't say no. It's not a matter whether it can be racist. The reason why people were chastising him is because he was racist. Excusing people's beliefs because they're old is not is not the way you do things. They're still wrong. You say that this is something that, you know, it's not racist because You know? That's just how old men are or whatever. And then, basically, he would say to anybody. You think he would say it to anybody. For no reason at all. But you can't show me an example of this being a thing that people tell white people. Or the this is a thing where you see old Pentankar's white men say this to white people. So I don't understand how you could just say like Show  [00:12:05] Speaker 4: me another video of a fucking white dude saying, Angel Black dude.  [00:12:09] User: Alright.  [00:12:10] Speaker 1: I got  [00:12:11] Speaker 2: you.  [00:12:12] Speaker 4: I don't understand, like, what that would prove anyways. What what do you mean? Like,  [00:12:16] Speaker 1: I don't How would it  [00:12:18] Speaker 3: not prove something? Well, so based you're just saying that it wouldn't prove anything because white people aren't racist against black people ever. Like, I don't understand why we wouldn't prove anything. That's  [00:12:27] Speaker 4: not what  [00:12:28] Speaker 2: the fucking saying at all.  [00:12:30] User: Yeah. Jesus fucking  [00:12:31] Speaker 2: Christ.  [00:12:32] User: That's how.  [00:12:33] Speaker 1: That's how you do it.  [00:12:34] User: Maybe you should fucking do your research before you fucking, like, sit here and try and talk shit to me.

[00:13:11] Speaker 3: But you ask, like, like, I'm trying to tell you that your experience doesn't matter, but what are you doing to else? I'm not trying to do that. I'm trying to get you to see the other people's experience who are suffering from this kind of issue. Like I said, whenever you bring up stuff, I don't know I don't know enough about, I don't argue with you about it. And I don't, like, even say anything  [00:13:30] Speaker 2: contrary to what you say until I fucking research and I know what I'm talking about. At least. But you don't even care enough to do that.

**Title:** Impact of Ocean Heat on Extreme Weather and Future Climate Projections

**Overview:** The conversation discusses the connection between ocean heat absorption and extreme weather events, highlighting data from the State of the Climate 2024 report. Between 2005 and 2023, oceans absorbed an average of 3,100,000 terawatt hours of heat. This has contributed to a rise in atmospheric moisture levels, leading to more frequent extreme weather events such as hurricanes and cyclones. In India, there was an increase in extreme weather events in the first nine months of 2024, with 255 out of 274 days experiencing such events, resulting in significant loss of life. The conversation also touches on future climate projections, warning that current carbon dioxide emission levels could exhaust the 1.5°C carbon budget in six years, with a potential breach of the 2°C limit within 27 years. This poses significant challenges for future generations, including higher sea levels and more extreme weather conditions.

The state of the climate 2,000 24 report says between 2005 and 2023, the ocean absorbed an average approximately 3,100,000 terawatt hours of heat. This is more than 18 times the world's energy consumption in 2023. According to the Glaseous Clapeyron equation, for every 1 degree rise in global average temperature, there would be a 7% rise in atmospheric moisture levels. The impacts of this are evidenced by recent extreme weather events.  [00:00:31] Speaker 1: Hurricanes, cyclones, torrential rains, and others. In we take the case of India, let's look at this graph. It shows day wise extreme weather events in India in the 1st 9 months of 2024. 255 days of extreme weather events out of 274 days. Last year, the numbers were lower at 235 days for the same period. 3,238 people lost their lives due to such events in 2,034. Compared to 2,755 in 2022. A rise of 18% in just 3 years. So what does the future hold? In 2034, carbon dioxide emissions are expected to be 52% higher than preindustrial levels. The 2,024 global carbon budget warns that at current rates, we'll exhaust the current budget for 1.5 degree Celsius in just 6 years. Even the 2 degree Celsius limit could be breached within 27 years. For generation alpha, this means living with higher sea levels, more extreme weather, and shrinking chances of turning things around. So the final question is, can we act in time to give them a chance for a safer future? Or test their survival as we witness greater losses.

That are fighting against Ebola. And I think that either way, we can only really to our life as students, and then we can try to what we can as individuals to make the world a better place.  [00:28] Speaker 2: Do you thank men do you thank men for giving women the right to vote?  [00:32] Speaker 1: I would say that Inherently, was it however it happened? I mean, I understand men played a huge part in women's having the right to vote. But I I would say that either way, that doesn't make women of any less value or men of any less value. I think that culture changes and shifts, and, You know, we're in a much different place now than we were back before women had the right to vote. So I would like to speak to the right here and now if that's okay. So wait. I hear you saying that you don't wanna talk about the general culture. Of the USA  [01:10] Speaker 3: and people in the USA not liking or protecting women. You don't like to acknowledge the that's a thing. You don't like to acknowledge that your friend's story helps so many people because a large majority of people have been in situations like that. A large majority of women. I understand you don't wanna talk about that and that you wanna talk about your own personal experience. So I guess that I'll ask you from your own personal experience Can you give us an example of something that your husband has protected you from actively?  [01:42] Speaker 1: Sure. First, I'd like to acknowledge that I'm hearing you putting words in my mouth, and I don't appreciate  [01:47] Speaker 3: Hear again?

First, I'd like to acknowledge that I'm hearing you putting words in my mouth, and I don't appreciate that. But As far as what my husband has protected me from, I just Think on a daily basis, he's protective of me and of our family. I think that, okay. I'll give you one example. We used to live in a very unsafe neighborhood. We didn't know that it was unsafe when we, decided to live there. You know, we just we're looking up houses on this or whatever, and we found one. That was reasonably priced, and it looked nice enough. When we moved in, we found out it was not a great neighborhood. And, and while we were there, you know, we would hear gunshots, almost, nightly and there was a lot of drug stuff going on. And, there was more than one time that my husband had to get up in the middle of the night and, to go out to figure out what was going on outside. You know, there were a lot of shady here, and there's that we'd come by our house and flood out, like my children are wearing safe to play outside. We only stayed the first few months and got Now we own a house somewhere else, but that's fine. That's the  [03:09] Speaker 4: way to do it. Okay.  [03:11] Speaker 1: I'm being willing to lay down at white even your kids  [03:14] Speaker 3: the night? That's  [03:15] Speaker 1: I think you're I  [03:17] Speaker 5: like the view of  [03:19] Speaker 3: the way that he protected you in any of those situations. You just and and and also, it sounds like if there's drugs where the drugs In your home? Like, what was so like, so there were drugs in the area.

There was a lot of drug activity in my neighborhood. There was we lived across from a drug dealer, and there was another one down the street. I'm  [04:00] Speaker 3: pretty  [04:01] Speaker 1: sure there was one  [04:02] Speaker 5: it  [04:03] Speaker 3: was a  [04:04] Speaker 1: very That's true.  [04:05] Speaker 3: Fewer.  [04:06] Speaker 1: See the d words. It says substances or something else. Oh, I saw  [04:09] Speaker 4: I  [04:10] Speaker 1: I don't know what what else to call.  [04:12] Speaker 2: I did get a I did get a $5 retip from Buck. Buck said, can you ask Holler why she can't just answer a question normally instead of rambling 6 minutes about something vaguely related?  [04:24] Speaker 1: But, Okay. I'm sorry. I have many words. I'm a writer. So I  [04:28] Speaker 4: apologize.  [04:29] Speaker 1: I will try to be more direct with my answers.  [04:32] Speaker 2: Taylor also sent a a a read tip and said if y'all were hearing gunshots why would your man go outside? 10 survival skills.  [04:40] Speaker 1: Our house that and he would go out  [04:43] Speaker 5: and  [04:44] Speaker 1: he himself was on to make sure that nobody was gonna try to get by us. And more than one time, he put himself in harm's way to protect our neighbors as well. Oh, give an example. A  [04:56] Speaker 5: lot of that  [04:58] Speaker 3: The big example would be great because it sounds like he's just inserting himself into other people's business and but so far, what you're saying, right, is that he was, like, insertion cell into situations that he wasn't a part of that put your family in danger. And was judgmental of the neighbors.  [05:19] Speaker 4: That sounds  [05:20] Speaker 3: so a specific example of how he protected you would be great.  [05:24] Speaker 4: I'm  [05:25] Speaker 1: sorry. Said that he was just mental as a neighbor that was kind of spewed up our other name is Do you hear yourself? I'm so sorry. That is just so silly.

[06:24] Speaker 3: I would say I I think  [06:26] Speaker 2: I  [06:27] Speaker 3: think  [06:28] Speaker 2: is really quickly. I think it doesn't matter what your husband has done for  [06:31] Speaker 4: you  [06:32] Speaker 2: when the bulk of women have had a violent experience at the hands of a man they know. I would say most would probably have had violent experiences at the hands of men they know. So, like, whether your husband Okay. Does not remove the inherent issue of sexism that exist within our current society.  [06:54] Speaker 1: I would say that and I am sure that this is gonna be a lot of less deals. But I would say that the problem isn't so much spectrum,  [07:01] User: or race  [07:02] Speaker 1: the other thing. This is the problem, and I noticed that the dog it there. I think the inherent problem that we have is Sprint. We have that, Hey. Oh, god. And that's the one to abide 5. It says No.  [07:18] Speaker 2: Shut up. I gotta restart I gotta restart the live.

[00:00:01] Speaker 1: Within a century, if you go as high as a billing deaths, all the time. No matter what way you call it, you're listed, in stability or its on rate of profit. Or it's It's good for business to express what has proven  [00:00:17] User: Always  [00:00:19] Speaker 1: US today. Or force the depression of wages to as low as they can This results in decolonialism for capitalist gain in Oh, secure markets, and secure be unemployment, All of this degradation of infrastructure, and limitations on the access base. Republican or Democrat, liberal, conservative, it doesn't matter. It still happens. Can we hear about socialism Not only is it projection, those that promote capitalism like the poverty. Than any of the evidence. What of the Black Book of Communism The number of 100,000,000 can realistically be traced only to this academic work, and I use those words loosely.  [00:01:03] User: Wow. Oh, wow.  [00:01:05] Speaker 1: Because, you know, that makes sense. Basically, fertility rates went down in, for example, 8 times. A woman who would have had 4 kids now only had 2, have more kids in the family. It's Oh, wow. Fucking ridiculous this is. Counting propharmists that would brown out the majority of Jews And finally, the nail in the coffin is that 2 of the 3 main officers publicly distanced If you're interested in a more detailed dive into the the sad excuse of a book, take a look at Revolution Left Radio's episode on it. But We can move on to an actually productive Hello? To one very special dislike American foreign policy and government as a direct result of American action in and around the countries. The sacred very rarely extends to regular American people, likewise victims of the same oppressive structures in other ways. Despite the time being beneficiaries of the carnage and dimensions the US carries out globally. Today's country is it on. With an ancient cultural heritage going back 1000 of years and boasting the oldest declaration of human For priority's sake, we'll start with the 20th century, specifically, 1920 1, 1, during which the British supported into It was not a normal coup, however, and while Rilla was really in charge from his post s I when he was crowned Mark, as will become a theme in this video, motivating factor for this school was the forced oil.  [00:02:43] Speaker 0: Alright. Dan, do you disagree with any of the announcements on the board? Yes.  [00:02:48] Speaker 1: It was kind of so for the Cummins and Gutter Cleaning,  [00:02:52] Speaker 2: Alina, you were basically dead on the  [00:02:54] Speaker 1: 2138. Dead on the money. That is crazy. Okay, Dan. So I my apologies. Yeah.  [00:03:01] Speaker 2: So I'd ask you. I'd be like, I  [00:03:03] Speaker 1: as sort of, like, as the abolition of private property or, like, if I wanted to find it, like, in a really broad sense, I say money. Which the means of production have been granted to the community as a whole.  [00:03:12] Speaker 2: K. So, like, I feel like practical person where if I look at cognitive metabolism, see capitalism very much like the garden for And I have a bit of time to use when they can go. Can I  [00:03:20] Speaker 1: see the better?  [00:03:22] Speaker 2: Much better, more wholesome ideology whereas the world today, I go if I want for at least a there are many of people, like free health care, How is he I see that  [00:03:31] Speaker 1: a  [00:03:32] Speaker 2: better way we're not back at the pathway to this is something like that. Would be through, like, a strong central government providing social services to people within the capital of society And I don't know about the big bucks.  [00:03:39] Speaker 1: Sorry, Ricky.  [00:03:41] Speaker 2: The problem is  [00:03:42] Speaker 1: Social services is just a way for capitalism to pass the of responsibility for paying people a livable wage onto other people in the working class.  [00:03:49] Speaker 2: So  [00:03:51] Speaker 1: we're we're paying for for welfare and SNAP benefits and unemployment and all that through our taxes, it's because the businesses are not paying Walmart is one of the is I think it's the number one employer of welfare and snappers A Walmart or grocery store. Eat pays its so little that they have to go on welfare and SNAP benefits. To afford to buy a burger. They work in a grocery store. This is a dystopia.  [00:04:23] Speaker 3: Obviously, because they work there and they  [00:04:25] Speaker 2: Yeah. Like, we may not have been passed to force large corporations to pay with more of a fair share providing these social services so that they all had passed on to, like, the So what you know, for the blimp that we're in, that it it it not happening but I can get past 4 where it could happen compared to past where, you know, the whole tablet, which I have a little bit in  [00:04:50] Speaker 1: Sorry. I'm chewing. I don't wanna chew on my throat. Okay. The biggest issue here Like, at its core, I think capitalism is unethis.  [00:04:57] Speaker 2: Reason I  [00:04:58] Speaker 3: believe  [00:04:59] Speaker 1: this is because I think it is unethical to own private get I think it really it really showed I think it's unethical to come in purchase a lake of fresh water and then sell that water people. I think it's unethical to own land. Right? I don't I don't understand how we're we're  [00:05:14] Speaker 2: we're  [00:05:15] Speaker 1: justifying land ownership in in in the world. Right? I think it's unethical to own private property. Thus, we'll make happen with the long time. The only way to pro to to maximize profit is to undervalue your labor.  [00:05:26] Speaker 0: Going through a ball against the  [00:05:27] Speaker 1: the owning class. As they continue to be pushed. As they continue to continue and we've and we've seen this In every society, ever, right, we've literally seen that the people in the ruling class tend to get overthrown if they push the lower class too far. And I genuinely think of, capitalism is is going to hit that stage. We may not soon, but definitely hit that stage. before you say, like, you you Only they produce for, like, what you would need based off your ability. How and where do you, like, want to check inside of Cognizant? Because, for help from people. But, like, some people want larger houses, or they want nicer view. How do you how do you I don't care about what people want. I love While there's still  [00:06:19] Speaker 2: people that need to be liberated, I don't care about the wants of of people that have already been liberated.  [00:06:24] Speaker 1: Right. I don't care about that.  [00:06:27] Speaker 2: What I want and what I wanna see happen under a communist framework is that the people who are suffering have their needs met. Once we've met everyone need everyone needs, then we can start talking about wants. I don't care that little Jimmy wants a PlayStation. When little when little, Jonathan is a slave. In the Congo because the America wants more iPhones. Right? I don't care that that that Steve from Ohio wants a larger house when Jeff in, Latin America is suffering because the United States is installing big cases for imprisoning his family. Right? The Wats knew nothing until liberation of our nation.  [00:07:05] Speaker 3: Like, not everybody wants the same things. And also in a sense, a site like that, like, you know, when we're talking about the commitment to the community, Okay. Well, maybe you can get the bigger house, but you have to, you know, contribute 30 hours a week. Versus, like, if you just get the 1 bedroom apartment, you have to contribute 6 hours a week.  [00:07:20] Speaker 2: So I'm  [00:07:21] Speaker 4: not gonna trade that.  [00:07:22] Speaker 2: Personally personally, I think we should we need to demolish a lot of these larger houses  [00:07:27] Speaker 3: Can we talk about houses that have, like, 9 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms? Like, why? Why do you need more bathrooms in a bedroom? Like, maybe one extra one, like, for a for a guest bath, but, like, there's a these are ridiculous.  [00:07:36] Speaker 1: I think we need to we need  [00:07:38] Speaker 2: more half that.  [00:07:39] User: Just  [00:07:40] Speaker 4: because,  [00:07:41] Speaker 2: like, if someone's taking a shower and I have a piss, bro. I got a piss.  [00:07:43] Speaker 3: I love a good half bath.  [00:07:45] Speaker 4: Let's  [00:07:46] Speaker 2: say let's say America wants to wants to, let's say, we're moving more to a socialist economy system and we and we have to figure out how we do houses. What I would do is the way we set the system up. Is I'd say every house sitting on land has a €100 lease. Right? You get a 100 year lease. In this house. The land is not owned by you. The house is owned by you. But, you know, you can build a  [00:08:05] Speaker 4: car  [00:08:06] Speaker 0: And, like, whoever wins that lottery, You what? I don't actually know. Well, how you sort of, like, limited resources, like, sort of, like, like, certain, like, types of housing or just, like,  [00:08:17] Speaker 1: some sort of the majority do about what would want They were 1 Have it having to shoot you something like that. Yeah. I sure. I don't think there are limited resources. That's that's my answer. Right? Let's let's take housing, for instance. I don't think there's limited resources when it comes house I just don't think we affect we we officially do housing. Right? Like I said, we have how many, how many large homes that one person or 2 people live in? Right? When you said we can utilize that land to make much more housing. Like,  [00:08:42] Speaker 2: right, we should be we should be doing stuff like that.  [00:08:44] Speaker 1: Many how many older buildings that we can be converted converted into communal living spaces? When it comes to food sources, the the earth, we we throw away on the planet, like, planet wide. More food than than isn't that that is needed. Right? And we think we can all the food waste that we have would  [00:09:02] Speaker 2: feed  [00:09:03] Speaker 1: everybody.  [00:09:05] Speaker 2: Right?  [00:09:06] Speaker 3: Water duplicate duplicative businesses.  [00:09:08] Speaker 2: Can  [00:09:09] Speaker 3: we  [00:09:09] Speaker 3: repurpose those buildings? Like, how many mattresses or do we need?  [00:09:13] Speaker 1: Pro, I drive past 3 mattress firms.  [00:09:15] Speaker 4: To get to the  [00:09:16] Speaker 1: How many dollars do you hope for later?  [00:09:18] Speaker 4: Spaces. That that takes like, material domain hours And, I mean, if there was a wrapped amount of these sort of resources available now. I mean, like, the reason why certain copies of primary thing. There's one of the  [00:09:34] Speaker 2: most  [00:09:35] Speaker 4: Materials  [00:09:36] Speaker 1: are not limited. We have the materials.  [00:09:39] Speaker 2: Is  [00:09:40] Speaker 3: enough.  [00:09:41] Speaker 0: I meant like I have some makeup on but just like the foundation. And because I came and opened the door, I don't think I rubbed it all in. So if there's any weird spots, that's fine. Thank you so much. Get lighter? Yes. I'll go. Now I'm gonna see what's one little Uh-huh. What is that? What popped off. Oh, okay.  [00:10:00] Speaker 1: But that's the  [00:10:01] Speaker 0: color it's gonna be. Oh, that color is so cool.

The guy is going back. see  [00:00:02] Speaker 1: is the way it was because we were forced to be uneducated for 100 of by America. So so if they're if they're forcing us to not be  [00:00:08] User: Actually,  [00:00:09] Speaker 2: I I listened to something the other day that made, like, a very good point about like, the way that That  [00:00:13] Speaker 1: culture group.  [00:00:15] Speaker 2: The way that some black people say, like, they'd be doing this or whatever. I don't know. I'll I'll tell you  [00:00:20] Speaker 1: later. I said  [00:00:21] Speaker 2: What'd you say? Oh,  [00:00:22] Speaker 1: I  [00:00:23] Speaker 2: was saying that I heard, something that made a very good point, like, was very they explained, the way that some black people talk, like, very well. Like, the whenever they say, like, something like, they'd be doing this whatever. And, like, how it's, like, not proper English, but actually, like, I don't know his explanation for alright. It was a very good it was a very insightful, video that made perfect sense, actually. He gave he explained why they talk like like what how that happened, like, how they talk like that anyways the first place. But he made a pretty good point on, like, that kinda, like I forgot. I can't I'm I don't wanna repeat it, but show you  [00:00:57] Speaker 1: later,  [00:00:58] Speaker 2: basically.  [00:00:59] Speaker 1: That I would to me, that would be like supremacist.  [00:01:01] Speaker 1: Do  [00:01:02] Speaker 2: you guys need to speak properly well? This guy  [00:01:04] User: You guys  [00:01:05] Speaker 2: hello?  [00:01:06] Speaker 0: Very directly what it was that Ira Ira and Kanye West had to use when you submitted, and you said it was the change of vernacular. Right? It was. Yes. So then why Okay. For lack of a little bit here. But they were never allowed to get a step outside of that racial etiquette. We had to get that in a lot of  [00:01:25] Speaker 1: cast, and most of them are old. That's not about that's not about the population. It's not about  [00:01:30] Speaker 0: population Right?  [00:01:31] Speaker 1: We don't have a book on the books official language. We just happen to speak English. Yes. Because that will only lead to people who are down on the That was late. Okay. Well, we can come to a very diverse person in American. The entire melting pot, so to speak. So making it official would be probably extremely problematic and would require a lot of pragmatic So, there's probably a reason why it's not official. But the overall is gonna be limited in there. So there's really no it's nothing to define that or to defeat that purpose, and it's saying it's not efficient. So  [00:02:13] Speaker 2: Yeah. All all all I'm saying all  [00:02:15] Speaker 1: I'm on Mickey. All plenty out there. Is that the idea that all a  [00:02:18] Speaker 2: I didn't  [00:02:19] Speaker 1: It happens. Other stuff does, and it's not a racist concept that is not. It's liberalism that is. Oh,  [00:02:24] Speaker 2: speaking,  [00:02:25] Speaker 1: they're speaking Korean. So Damn. Can't understand those techs, but it's  [00:02:29] Speaker 3: not gonna be  [00:02:30] Speaker 1: a problem.  [00:02:31] Speaker 4: I don't know the answer to it, but the statement is not to continue to learn languages. So we're not able to hear you. Saying your English wasn't even related to the English spoken on this country in this country,  [00:02:43] Speaker 1: right,  [00:02:44] Speaker 2: or on I'll say on this continent. Right? When English was not the language book in English, English was coarse, on the people who lived here by colonizers as for the English. This is my premise. This is why this is why the worst on the American  [00:03:01] Speaker 4: set up.  [00:03:03] Speaker 0: It's just changing over time. Right? I've been talking about? They're crazy.  [00:03:06] Speaker 1: people don't remember the language that they used to speak. And now  [00:03:09] Speaker 0: The slaves, they destroy people's lineage. Right. So they it's like there's linguistic  [00:03:12] Speaker 1: I do not wanna call you games, but you cannot sit here and stay at the headphones need spoken  [00:03:16] Speaker 0: I didn't say just because white people spoke with the right language. You didn't  [00:03:19] Speaker 1: because that language has been forced onto other And Oh my god. My question. The reason that they urge them to keep in representation What the fuck? Quite what you say to do the ventilator and fly out with operations with that It's  [00:03:34] User: a debate.  [00:03:35] Speaker 1: So just because you believe it doesn't mean it's a little bit. As being it's gonna be truthful or proven to be biased. This is not what an anecdotal event  [00:03:41] User: Yeah.  [00:03:42] Speaker 1: Statements like, oh, I'm gonna change you. Savages language and You you absolutely get more quoting it from a book, and it really doesn't help. People. Yeah. Colonizing for the Yeah. I'm I'm sure. Anyway, like I was saying, like I was saying, it's it's not just I believe that our, concern to me is changing. It's the values of the team. Like, I'm here for understanding not not to hear and apologize, but this is why I told the way to the point when you are claiming that a white spoken language is racist alongside the fact of them putting it on other people, which still isn't racist. That cultural language, at all. To debounce the point of your idea of your category. This 50. That's the true gold answer to take for 1 or not yet to express. They were like that. But there's all the There's going to be a perception of the brain. Just like how the they're not number 1. It's too big drive below. One of these fenders came over and fired guns. Was becoming quite hot with the dot dot, so it sounds like thunder. You have to understand the to having this social conflict and white people. So I'm not gonna disprove your point. Am just saying that most of what you're going at is halfway. You're just demonizing and then standing on the dead grave. It doesn't seem very well. If you could easily point out that there are multiple values and cultural cultures that coalesce in this way. You know? So so the thing you said there, you can dish out a little bit there.  [00:05:01] Speaker 2: One, 1 directly from the National Museum of American Indians. Although there was a recognition of native rights to own land, official American documents use terms like savage, and uncivilized to describe native people. They quite literally wrote these words in their manual back that they didn't post. Hold on. Hold on. You said that by saying this, I was using anecdote 11. I'm not. This is actual history to claim this anecdote is historic. Second,  [00:05:34] Speaker 1: correlate it. That's all. Wanted to know because there's also another thing that you made about, English. And  [00:05:39] Speaker 2: I'm going to get to it if you stop talking.  [00:05:41] Speaker 1: I'm gonna get  [00:05:42] Speaker 2: to it. Jones.

So, like, is it like the argument was never that I think that as well, which is what they're what people are trying  [00:04:35] Speaker 1: to deny.  [00:04:36] Speaker 3: How was this? It's it's  [00:04:39] Speaker 2: think he's trying to say something way more nefarious, and we're just gonna have our mind blown in a  [00:04:43] User: second. I have no idea.  [00:04:45] Speaker 3: Yeah.  [00:04:46] Speaker 1: That too. On the first.  [00:04:48] Speaker 5: Yeah. It was the thing,  [00:04:50] Speaker 3: but  [00:04:51] Speaker 2: he's having a really hard time, though.  [00:04:53] Speaker 3: I she left about then. 30 years ago, 40 years ago.  [00:04:57] Speaker 4: I think because you don't see what Martin Luther King or Malcolm x, would be disregarding the massive amounts of work that are under gun in black neighborhoods. The litany of organizations that exist to, like, help  [00:05:04] Speaker 3: with  [00:05:05] Speaker 4: disparities in black neighborhoods. Like, right? I just because you might have to see them, but see that they don't exist. Just because No. No. No. I I  [00:05:10] Speaker 3: of this, Jim. Let me tell you about the oven.  [00:05:12] Speaker 4: The shot the CIA shot and killed them.  [00:05:15] Speaker 3: Not like history. It's not mix the same.  [00:05:17] Speaker 2: I thought he said it's not my history, but, yeah, that makes sense too for him.  [00:05:20] Speaker 3: Point.  [00:05:21] Speaker 1: But I was like,  [00:05:23] Speaker 2: wait. Then why are you fucking invading  [00:05:25] Speaker 1: this? What are  [00:05:26] Speaker 2: you talking about? Maybe I don't know. I don't think he's not he sounds like he's not  [00:05:30] User: from the  [00:05:31] Speaker 2: US, so that's why I thought he said that.  [00:05:33] Speaker 3: Heat the the  [00:05:34] Speaker 1: He's having  [00:05:36] Speaker 2: a really hard time trying to say when a shit today. This is fine. It's okay. She's just I mean, You can't, like  [00:05:41] Speaker 1: he never said  [00:05:43] Speaker 2: he was, like, a debater or, like, any kind of, like, person who professionally speaks, like, speaks or whatever. I  [00:05:47] Speaker 1: don't know.  [00:05:48] Speaker 3: Debate on this. I'm I'm sorry about that. Alright.  [00:05:51] Speaker 4: Will  [00:05:52] Speaker 1: do.  [00:05:53] Speaker 3: I would like to I'd like okay. We this is more of a a debate, but you see capitalism is harmful. I've heard you talk about bringing the  [00:05:58] Speaker 1: power of Wait. Hold on one second.  [00:06:00] User: Yep. Yeah, Helen.  [00:06:02] Speaker 3: So okay. So the the the capital is down for for the countries that Welcome. Hey, I  [00:06:06] User: gotta quit. So Thank  [00:06:09] Speaker 3: you. It has nothing to do with the fact that when support is sent to countries, that the country's governments are using the same capital as we say, hey, we're going to increase the taxes on said resources. Checkpoint. No.  [00:06:15] Speaker 4: It doesn't matter about these resources  [00:06:18] Speaker 1: we  [00:06:19] Speaker 4: set, like, what aid being sent to these countries. Look at the history of these countries. These countries have been stripped for the natural resources for fucking all for 100  [00:06:25] Speaker 1: of years.  [00:06:26] Speaker 6: Sending them a little bit of data, they can see what it is. But them in charge of their own country and not sending in fascist dictators And when  [00:06:31] Speaker 4: America gets a little mad that a country votes in the socialist leader  [00:06:34] Speaker 6: is, you know, kinda stupid.  [00:06:36] Speaker 1: So I  [00:06:37] User: What? I'm gonna put  [00:06:38] Speaker 1: butter.  [00:06:39] Speaker 2: Did you eat my friend's house? So are we  [00:06:41] Speaker 3: always different? I'm  [00:06:43] Speaker 1: just  [00:06:44] Speaker 5: kidding. I  [00:06:45] Speaker 2: just wanted to get a reaction. American  [00:06:48] Speaker 1: capitalism? Love you.  [00:06:50] Speaker 2: I love you.  [00:06:51] Speaker 1: I put it I didn't put it anywhere where he could get it.  [00:06:53] Speaker 2: He's fine. Maybe he's fine. He's not doing anything. He's singing. Sort of way  [00:06:56] Speaker 3: kind of  [00:06:57] Speaker 6: 1500. UK,  [00:06:59] Speaker 3: Saint Peter's  [00:07:01] Speaker 6: any capitalist country is gonna do an imperialism. It means the motive of capitalism is to expand.  [00:07:05] Speaker 3: It's  [00:07:06] Speaker 4: profits, and you can't expand profits without expanding to other regions and, like, increasing your production. Right. In order to increase this production, they tend to expand into countries that have the resources they need  [00:07:14] Speaker 2: to increase their production.  [00:07:16] Speaker 6: And they try to get those, resources for as little money as possible.  [00:07:19] Speaker 3: Bye. And how would a different system be any less harmful?  [00:07:22] Speaker 5: Yep.  [00:07:23] Speaker 6: The socialism would would not put the power inside the business owner.  [00:07:27] Speaker 1: It  [00:07:28] Speaker 5: would  [00:07:29] Speaker 4: put the power  [00:07:31] Speaker 2: into No.  [00:07:32] Speaker 6: And the workers are going to make the decisions for everybody. As of so worker the workers collectively together So for instance, if we give you workers the means of production, a country like Chile, where they now have control over their mining operations, they're not going to  [00:07:38] Speaker 4: sell America all their resources and get no money in  [00:07:41] Speaker 6: return.  [00:07:42] Speaker 4: Right? Because they now own those resources. They own that means of mining. Right? Whereas right now, the mining is  [00:07:46] Speaker 1: owned  [00:07:47] Speaker 6: by by a fascist government instead of just giving America whatever they want. For some kickbacks, but without pushing any of that back  [00:07:52] User: Brian, go.  [00:07:53] Speaker 3: Working  [00:07:54] Speaker 4: those mines This is how socialism would do this better.  [00:07:57] Speaker 2: 5. Mhmm.  [00:07:58] Speaker 3: So now you have a a a mine owned by the people. I that mine? I still yet to find someone who can compete for a pure ore or pure coal or whatever. That needs to be translated into a means of bread electricity, water, etcetera, right, basic needs. Uh-huh. They  [00:08:06] would  [00:08:07] Speaker 6: just sell the resources  [00:08:09] Speaker 2: like The people does he what does he not understand? The people are the ones who do all of those things. They they do the work. Like, not the people who have money. So what do you mean? It's not like it would be impossible if we didn't fucking capitalists. That doesn't make  [00:08:16] Speaker 5: sense. Resources,  [00:08:18] Speaker 3: you're trying to take it  [00:08:20] Speaker 1: to  [00:08:21] Speaker 6: market.  [00:08:22] Right?  [00:08:23] Right? So America wants to  [00:08:25] Speaker 5: buy  [00:08:26] Speaker 6: copper.  [00:08:27] Speaker 4: And they go, well, this is the only copper mine. What are you gonna do? Kinda have to buy copper from the copper mine. They can't where are they else are they gonna get the copper? Right?  [00:08:33] Speaker 3: Right. But it's not the only customer.  [00:08:34] Speaker 6: America  [00:08:35] Speaker 4: gets, like, 70% of its resources is copper from  [00:08:37] Speaker 1: Chile.  [00:08:39] Speaker 3: Right. But as I said, that is mine 1 of somebody out today. Right? Because Yeah. There are multiple mines of volatility. They were all put in the in the  [00:08:43] Speaker 5: Yeah.  [00:08:44] Speaker 3: No. So we would  [00:08:46] Speaker 4: not allow people to own the  [00:08:48] Speaker 6: home. Oh. Yeah. That would be a thing. Uh-huh.  [00:08:50] Speaker 0: We could say both are on the copper line. What do you mean workers' aid? So so killing is a big country. I  [00:08:55] Speaker 1: can't No. But that's the thing. That's the point is it. There's no competition. We're all working together. It's all to benefit everybody. You know? There's no comp there's no need to compete.  [00:09:02] Speaker 0: Think of it like more in the shop in the in the shopping mall. It's spread over the whole kind of The people who work for the mines who collect ore, those are the works. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So those workers  [00:09:12] Speaker 1: in the Sao Paulo, Chile, 1 heat. The markers in the north part of QUE, 1 to eat. 8. Do they then come together and say, oh, we'll call say we sell alcohol for x amount of money. Or is it, hey. You really wanna eat. We we have one of those set up. So I'm not gonna give it for 2 months. Those minds would just be folded together to be be be mock like, to be one  [00:09:30] Speaker 2: one group. Right? The minds wouldn't be wouldn't be 2 separate mines. Like, the workers of each mine would collectively own both mines. Right? This is how this is how it works. Otherwise, you're gonna put in direct competition with each other. So it's Marley's makes not strides, but they they already make  [00:09:38] Speaker 1: Okay?  [00:09:39] Speaker 2: So they have a they have the work on waste right away.  [00:09:43] Speaker 0: Wire from you down to 2 x. The mind's speech. That's where they needed that industry. So instead, what they did is they they instilled violence tools in Chile. Right? They could have gone somewhere else. They didn't. We already know this isn't the case. If they we already know that they they are only gonna get it from one place to them, one place being Right now, that's where they're going for this because of time source. Right? Otherwise, they would have gone and got it from another one. When Chile did this, when, Ayende took power, but they didn't. They violently destroyed the the Okay. You  [00:10:06] Speaker 1: know, we would say it's that, but we would say there's no capitalism as a whole. Did you say he's the USA.  [00:10:09] Speaker 2: Oh my god. Global  [00:10:10] Speaker 1: leader  [00:10:12] Speaker 2: in  [00:10:13] Speaker 1: maintaining worldwide capitalism. The USA will destroy any any hint of socialism or communism that he gets whip up because if he doesn't, the USA is at risk. So they maintain top down from worldwide.  [00:10:15] User: Yeah. They're the ones, like why they wouldn't doing most  [00:10:18] Speaker 2: coos and stuff. Right?  [00:10:20] Speaker 3: Why we went into Venezuela. That's why we went into cub tried to go into Cuba. That's why we went into Honduras. That's why we went into Puerto Rico. That's  [00:10:24] Speaker 1: why we went into Haiti. Like, there's so many. There's so many that we went  [00:10:28] Speaker 3: into  [00:10:29] Speaker 1: because we know that if any country is socialist, it's a risk to us. And democracy in the United States as a whole. If the world can see the social  [00:10:33] Speaker 2: acceptance  [00:10:34] User: of the  [00:10:35] Speaker 2: means  [00:10:36] Speaker 1: of production and not enforce them to their poverty by the working by the owner class. Right? They know workers are gonna rise  [00:10:39] Speaker 3: up.  [00:10:40] Speaker 1: And so they fly to stop that in any way they way, shape, or form that they can. This is all I've stated, by the way. The CIA admits to doing all  [00:10:43] Speaker 4: of that. No. No. No. No. I I know I know the document. Yep. Well, there was a bug in the way. Yeah. Yeah. So he knows he's drinking the Solade. Yeah. I understand. How denies the  [00:10:48] Speaker 2: Kool Aid. Mhmm.  [00:10:50] Speaker 4: I mean,  [00:10:51] User: But they didn't deny  [00:10:52] Speaker 4: it. Oh, they're not denying it. He does. He does. But he has. I  [00:10:56] Speaker 2: Knowing what is being said,  [00:10:58] Speaker 4: when you would  [00:10:59] Speaker 3: say being the leader  [00:11:01] Speaker 2: in  [00:11:02] Speaker 4: the  [00:11:03] Speaker 3: post market  [00:11:05] Speaker 2: is  [00:11:06] User: can't just be keep continue we can't continue just  [00:11:08] Speaker 4: being violent  [00:11:09] User: to other people elsewhere, like, forever. It it will not end. It will not Like,  [00:11:12] Speaker 4: Do you think the same would happen  [00:11:14] Speaker 5: if Eventually,  [00:11:16] User: they're gonna  [00:11:17] Speaker 5: Like,  [00:11:18] Speaker 4: Getting  [00:11:19] Speaker 2: tired of  [00:11:20] Speaker 4: my  [00:11:21] Speaker 2: student? Yeah.  [00:11:23] User: And or, like, just the what is it the roosters come home to roost?  [00:11:26] Speaker 3: Right? The USSR imploded from the inside when you  [00:11:29] Speaker 4: look  [00:11:31] Speaker 1: at  [00:11:32] Speaker 4: well,  [00:11:33] Speaker 3: there's American influence, but their their capitalist revolution came from the inside. From people who wanted to bring in a capitalist market because they wanted control Right? So the US is will help you do that. Right? So, actually, maybe they can do it happen in the  [00:11:38] Speaker 4: USSR  [00:11:39] Speaker 3: USA because the I don't know that the Yeah. The capitalist revolution in the USSR would have would have had the backing that they did had it not been for the USA backing  [00:11:43] Speaker 5: Of course.  [00:11:44] Speaker 1: So I don't know. I  [00:11:46] User: don't know of another We don't don't we take credit for  [00:11:49] Speaker 6: all the time? Like, what's the  [00:11:51] Speaker 4: Like, the  [00:11:52] Speaker 1: US does, whether you would where they will, like, help any any administration But  [00:11:55] Speaker 4: if they  [00:11:56] Speaker 6: see. It's really funny that, like, how how violent the communist are and stuff like that. Like, how the problem they are and how brutal and how, like, Like, sadly, they treat the people there. But then but then you'll hear them say,  [00:12:02] Speaker 4: like,  [00:12:03] Speaker 6: you've heard them say, oh, we are much stronger than the than communist Russia or whatever. Like as soon as we got there, they just gave up, like, raise their hands. It's like, wait. So what the fuck? Are they really brutal, like, or not? Like, they didn't even fight  [00:12:07] Speaker 4: you.  [00:12:09] Speaker 6: Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Not to people who are trying to just join the communist way of life. Right? Okay.  [00:12:12] Speaker 4: That  [00:12:13] Speaker 6: makes no sense.  [00:12:14] Speaker 3: Social?  [00:12:15] Speaker 2: So  [00:12:16] Speaker 1: maybe not  [00:12:17] Speaker 4: not.  [00:12:19] Speaker 6: How's it? It did that yesterday whenever it died. It's, like, echoed at the very end, like, right before it died.  [00:12:23] Speaker 4: So it's it's and and it's it's sort of in a different place. Are there no negative speech socialist?  [00:12:26] Speaker 1: They're a negative standing system. I'm implying socialism. It's perfect. Right?  [00:12:29] User: I guess 6:30 ish  [00:12:31] Speaker 4: the same you should 7  [00:12:33] Speaker 2: don't  [00:12:34] Speaker 3: know. Get rid of how terrible  [00:12:36] Speaker 4: cap capital I  [00:12:37] Speaker 6: don't know.  [00:12:38] Speaker 1: You know, there is a golfing system. Right? I wanna look at which system would engage in, like, harm reduction in giving the workers control over the profits that they earn. Probably gonna be less harmful than giving that to 1% of people.  [00:12:43] Speaker 2: Right.  [00:12:44] Speaker 4: And How does socialism handle stuff like, hand being handicapped, being unable to work,  [00:12:48] Speaker 1: people that can't afford these things. They'll probably be more expensive.  [00:12:51] Speaker 3: Because the workers would be the ones  [00:12:53] Speaker 1: we'll just do it that  [00:12:54] Speaker 4: way.  [00:12:56] Speaker 3: So  [00:12:57] Speaker 4: So so the people paying for obviously, insurance noncompetent.  [00:12:59] Speaker 2: Yeah. That  [00:13:00] Speaker 6: is actually  [00:13:01] Speaker 2: how all in  [00:13:02] Speaker 6: 2,  [00:13:03] Speaker 2: 3.  [00:13:04] Speaker 4: Wow.  [00:13:05] Speaker 6: Oh my  [00:13:06] Speaker 1: god.  [00:13:07] Speaker 4: But  [00:13:08] Speaker 3: what the issue was just expanding that nationally so  [00:13:11] Speaker 2: that  [00:13:12] Speaker 1: the pot is bigger. What  [00:13:13] Speaker 2: the  [00:13:14] Speaker 3: the fuck? And you're probably gonna be paying less because you're gonna be cutting off the  [00:13:17] Speaker 4: fat  [00:13:18] Speaker 1: of the middleman. Like, in America, at least, like, 40% of all insurance costs are  [00:13:21] Speaker 4: just has  [00:13:22] Speaker 1: increased. We cut off the administrative  [00:13:24] Speaker 2: flow.  [00:13:25] Speaker 1: And immediately it was a bit different. America is spending more for less Right? So clearly, the privatized health care system is working. Spend about 12,000 per person, and we don't get free health care work  [00:13:29] Speaker 3: per person.  [00:13:30] Speaker 1: At least their health care is free. At least it's free at the point of a point of service. You don't get turned away because you don't have insurance and can't afford the treatment. So so you have to risk it's, going to the ER and spending major ER bill just to get seen for something. Right? So I I just I I would just say, any any industry that is required for people to live, so health care, housing, food, water. I think all 4 of these should be not in America in America specifically, there are 600,000 It's Tiger. It's Tiger.  [00:13:34] Speaker 2: It's Tiger.  [00:13:36] Speaker 1: How many unoccupied houses there are. In the country?  [00:13:39] Speaker 3: I was shot  [00:13:40] Speaker 2: in  [00:13:41] Speaker 4: the gun. Half shot in the back, quarter of the of the  [00:13:44] Speaker 5: mouth?  [00:13:45] Speaker 1: There's 16,000,000 unoccupied houses in America.  [00:13:48] Speaker 3: We can house everybody.  [00:13:49] Speaker 1: It would take us  [00:13:50] Speaker 4: literally nothing. Yep. Since  [00:13:52] Speaker 2: the  [00:13:53] Speaker 3: HUD, the the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Development, only estimates that up to $20,000,000,000 a year. How to end homelessness in America. We spend a trillion on our military  [00:13:57] Speaker 4: budget. That's  [00:14:00] Speaker 2: how business That's a model account. It's  [00:14:02] Speaker 3: we don't because housing is a commodity.  [00:14:04] Speaker 1: The Wall Wall Street owns 41%  [00:14:06] Speaker 3: of all housing in America.  [00:14:08] Speaker 1: Right? Housing is a commodity. There's a profit incentive  [00:14:11] Speaker 3: to it. So  [00:14:12] Speaker 1: nobody has any incentive incentive To get housing away. Right? It because it's on a for profit model. This is why the government is trying to figure out how  [00:14:17] Speaker 3: to do it.  [00:14:18] Speaker 1: And we should remove the for profit element of housing. That way we can give people the people that are unhome Homes.  [00:14:22] Speaker 4: But you're talking about giving people homes.  [00:14:24] Speaker 2: Oh  [00:14:25] Speaker 1: my god. Everybody homes. You got a mortgage right now, your mortgage is forgiven. You're paying rent, not no more. Yes. I would give people these homes.  [00:14:29] Speaker 3: If we have  [00:14:30] Speaker 1: the resources to do it, the only reason not to do it is because we wanna generate a profit.  [00:14:34] Speaker 4: What what  [00:14:35] Speaker 2: what  [00:14:36] Speaker 4: so it's not a bank for a bank?  [00:14:37] Speaker 1: Wouldn't that bankrupt bank?  [00:14:39] Speaker 2: I'm not  [00:14:40] Speaker 3: gonna fire  [00:14:41] Speaker 2: out.  [00:14:42] Speaker 4: Mhmm.  [00:14:43] Speaker 6: Yeah.  [00:14:44] Speaker 1: We can work  [00:14:45] Speaker 2: all  [00:14:46] Speaker 3: that out  [00:14:47] Speaker 1: pretty  [00:14:48] Speaker 4: easily.  [00:14:49] Speaker 1: Right? We can make sure sure banks stay above  [00:14:51] Speaker 4: water.  [00:14:52] Speaker 3: We do it all the time anyway. Anytime a bank fucks up because they  [00:14:55] Speaker 1: The  [00:14:56] Speaker 3: they overdo it when it comes to housing. Bail them out anyway. How about this time when we bail them out, we get something in return?  [00:15:01] Speaker 4: Right. But yeah. That stuff that they can't pay. We get back. Right?  [00:15:04] Speaker 1: Again, if we didn't have the resources resources to use it, I probably have a business  [00:15:06] Speaker 4: partner.  [00:15:08] Speaker 2: But  [00:15:09] Speaker 7: we have to  [00:15:10] Speaker 1: resources necessary to do well. Right? The only reason we  [00:15:12] Speaker 4: don't  [00:15:14] Speaker 6: What about the banks? Well,  [00:15:15] Speaker 4: Should we go back? I mean, I know this is on your on your list. And you probably want to give someone else a call in. Should we go back to a trading economy? Based on solid  [00:15:19] Speaker 2: growth?  [00:15:20] Speaker 1: As as a as somebody who wants to eventually reach communism, let's do it. I'd I'd be so happy to be done with money. That's what we believe in anyway.  [00:15:24] Speaker 4: We believe in it as  [00:15:25] Speaker 3: stateless, moneyless, classless society when it comes to common So I'm totally fine with us moving back to a barter a trade and barter system. Right? I don't think we need money at at, like, at all.  [00:15:30] Speaker 1: I don't even know that we necessarily need trade as much either, but, like,  [00:15:34] Speaker 3: yeah, I'm totally fine with that. I have no no issues with us wanting to go back to like, this is what this is what Mark's writes anyway is that we the need  [00:15:39] Speaker 2: for  [00:15:40] Speaker 1: for money in the terms of, like, a state controlled currency won't be needed in a in a communist system. We won't need a state controlled currency.  [00:15:44] Speaker 2: Okay.  [00:15:45] Speaker 4: Okay. And then my last question and then I'll free up the lines. And thank you very much for this debate. Sure. Some people probably think, well, this this isn't a debate, but I some insights and I've I've been going out  [00:15:51] Speaker 7: for  [00:15:52] Speaker 4: what is stopping when It shouldn't really sound like  [00:15:55] Speaker 6: a debate to me. He was just sharing what he's understanding if he was. And then be learning otherwise.  [00:15:58] Speaker 4: People putting down their watch same.  [00:16:00] Speaker 6: No. Not that's not Not call me not capitalism, even communism. Whatever pillage you  [00:16:03] Speaker 2: can.  [00:16:04] Speaker 4: Right. You're not gonna yeah. No. I'm I'm yeah, I'm just saying, like, oh, I I don't wanna make ploy the put toilet case for safety. That'd be  [00:16:08] Speaker 2: Yeah. Go go just enough.  [00:16:09] Speaker 3: People are gonna do the jobs that that are there. Right? Peep there are people who like working in factories.  [00:16:12] Speaker 1: It's a thing that they're good at. It's a thing they like to do. They'll still do that. They're are people who like being garbage.  [00:16:16] Speaker 2: Gonna still do theft.  [00:16:18] Speaker 1: Right? The jobs will get done. And if we if they're being collectively done by the community, right, If somebody said, hey. Instead of working, 40 hours in an office every week, If you do 4 hours, out in the farm, that's it for your weekly duties.  [00:16:23] Speaker 3: Most people are gonna be like, sure. Yeah. After fucking a little bit. And then I give the rest of the time to myself?  [00:16:26] Speaker 2: Yeah.  [00:16:27] Speaker 4: Why not?  [00:16:29] Speaker 3: Correct. Right. American. They wouldn't be they wouldn't be  [00:16:31] Speaker 7: Well,  [00:16:32] Speaker 2: know  [00:16:34] Speaker 8: it's a pretty good  [00:16:35] Speaker 3: racist letter occurred on white Americans  [00:16:38] Speaker 4: Yeah. So why so what's the most reason why these tickets would not be possible for them to screw the  [00:16:42] Speaker 2: because  [00:16:43] Speaker 1: racism has to be backed by system  [00:16:46] Speaker 2: or,  [00:16:47] Speaker 3: Structures  [00:16:48] Speaker 1: specifically racist  [00:16:50] Speaker 2: Outcomes  [00:16:51] Speaker 1: against  [00:16:52] Speaker 3: different groups. My direct debt reduction that I use is,  [00:16:55] Speaker 1: the oppression of 1 racial group for  [00:16:57] Speaker 8: the  [00:16:58] Speaker 3: political, social, or economic benefit of another social group. And black people Actually, no no rights other than white people in that are able to to do that because the all of the systems that operate in our country are are strictly white supremacists.  [00:17:03] Speaker 1: System. So no no no  [00:17:05] Speaker 8: 84  [00:17:06] Speaker 2: I  [00:17:07] Speaker 4: guess, base of understanding But, so people can make up the system, and the system slash state is a, corroborate of the people. So if the issue is that  [00:17:10] Speaker 1: you have a state that is  [00:17:12] Speaker 4: racist, you have to be systematically racist.  [00:17:14] Speaker 9: Does it have to be since the system is intrinsically tied to the k.  [00:17:16] Speaker 7: Yes.  [00:17:18] Speaker 9: Is it just a general societal value rather than a state value or a people value?  [00:17:21] Speaker 1: No. I believe racism has to be systemic. And in order to be a racist, you have to uphold a racist a system of racism. That would be my  [00:17:26] Speaker 7: belief.  [00:17:27] Speaker 1: Countering that with, like, white people and  [00:17:29] Speaker 6: Oh my  [00:17:30] Speaker 9: god.  [00:17:31] Speaker 2: You people?  [00:17:32] Speaker 8: She  [00:17:33] Speaker 5: said you people  [00:17:34] Speaker 6: for sure. Hold on, babe. I didn't I didn't hear  [00:17:36] Speaker 3: you. I know. From white White.  [00:17:37] Speaker 2: White.  [00:17:39] Speaker 3: Racial group with not a white racial group.  [00:17:41] Speaker 1: Group. So white supremacy will oftentimes target other white groups to to kinda hide itself. Because at the end of the day,  [00:17:45] Speaker 3: white cisterncies just pop pop up a capitalist Our  [00:17:48] Speaker 8: section?  [00:17:49] Speaker 3: So right to front see exist to make sure that,  [00:17:51] Speaker 9: like,  [00:17:52] Speaker 3: poor people stay poor and rich, people stay rich.  [00:17:54] Speaker 1: If rich white people realize they like, if rich white people realize they can do that, by throwing some white people under the bus they're going to. But the second the structure start to change in any meaningful way, they're going to to bring back in those white people in the  [00:17:58] Speaker 2: fold.  [00:17:59] Speaker 3: To target,  [00:18:00] Speaker 1: other minority. So for for an example of this, directly with what you you brought up, the union, the dockworker unions in the early 1900  [00:18:03] Speaker 3: were were were, created with black and Italian people. Right? So or I'm sorry. Irish Americans.  [00:18:07] Speaker 1: No Italian Americans.  [00:18:09] Speaker 3: Sorry. Italian Americans. So black and Italian Americans it probably was Irish Americans as well. So black, in in Irish and Italian Americans started to form docker unions because of the mistreatment. And then the people that  [00:18:12] Speaker 1: owned these companies were like, hey. This is bad for us. So what can we do to to kind of stop this? So what they did is said, okay. Well, the Irish and Italian American you guys can form with unions, it will give you a better working condition, but you have to lead the black people in the best we  [00:18:17] Speaker 3: are not doing that.  [00:18:19] Speaker 1: The second they were able to reintegrate back into whiteness they left black Americans in the desk. So this is just how white supremacy operates and it's how it's how it's been able to survive so long is via these kind of shady practices.

Of course. They're very loud. They argue a lot. That's just, like, the way they are.  [00:05:36] Speaker 1: I shouldn't debate your mom on your show. Why? It's fun. Like, talking to a girl is alright. That's not right? My my mom died 4 years ago. He's  [00:05:42] Speaker 2: I can say that's how we show and we're about each other. She's  [00:05:45] Speaker 1: a maggot idiot. You shouldn't drag her  [00:05:47] Speaker 2: your trauma onto other people.  [00:05:49] Speaker 1: Okay? Because you sound pretty  [00:05:51] Speaker 2: traumatized.  [00:05:53] Speaker 1: Why do I need to, like Oh, no. I'm happy about it. What are you talking about? No. You're projecting it onto me. Like,  [00:06:00] Speaker 0: Like, oh my god. That's so good for you. I watched the World Wars. Yes. Actually. You're you're you said it as a joke, but that's true. Yeah. Really? I was happy, but went to Facebook and she was getting all of her news from, like, the memes and then, like, Alex Jones. Like, my mom will send me texts like,  [00:06:12] Speaker 1: why don't you treasure your mom?  [00:06:14] Speaker 2: I, like, I, you know, didn't tell her about it before she died, and now  [00:06:17] Speaker 0: look at what this guy said. And I'm like, mom, this guy tweeted 2 days ago that I was a cut That's why she's watching. I'm kind of more of, like, a  [00:06:23] Speaker 1: like a wildcard, like Really?

[00:07:04] Speaker 2: Twin baby babies with a Mercedes Benz with a tick those up to the meat Calling men ladies. That's what you do for your dog, though? Sorry, doc, but I'm being crazy. Do you ever go 8 mile in a debate? Where you're, like, I live in a trailer. My mama got much houses. I'm gay. Why don't you try  [00:07:22] Speaker 1: that? I'll try that. Yeah. I actually stopped with Simon and because he said he hadn't worked enough for me. So oh, I thought it was because this is awfully hot coffee pot freestyle against rope. Think there's an argument to be made that drugs can unlock parts of our minds and that when he stopped doing drugs, he away. Parts, like the wrapping  [00:07:39] Speaker 2: parts. Are you a drug guy?  [00:07:41] Speaker 1: I'm not like a crazy drug sky, but I like, you know, like, mushroom LSD, MDMA, that kind of stuff. You like tripping? Sometimes. Yeah. Not anymore. Yeah. Sometimes it's  [00:07:49] Speaker 2: scary. No? A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes you, like, realize that everyone in your life hates you and laughs at you behind your back.  [00:07:55] Speaker 1: Really?  [00:07:56] Speaker 2: But then you come out of it and you realize you're the most popular guy. So you dropped out of school? Yeah. Okay. Why? Because you sucked in music?  [00:08:01] Speaker 0: Me at all. What  [00:08:02] Speaker 1: I was doing at the time was  [00:08:04] Speaker 0: that email, the one up, and cc. In my mind, I'm like, oh, it's like an accountability Not me at all. Like, well, let's go through these write ups. And and then she, like, did you come in So  [00:08:12] Speaker 2: okay. So then you you were an early adopter of streaming in Twitch. Right? Arguably, the first. Full time job to do streaming. Yeah. So you saw the vision. No. I just carpet cleaning sucked. How did you gain providence or was, like, a funny guy to watch, play video games. Like, I'd, like, say funny things, argue, scream at people, whatever. Like, that was my Yeah. Part of that Cool. The experience. And then how did that how did you correlate that into debates or politics? By the time  [00:08:41] Speaker 1: Like, rules were trying to make video games. They it was just a whole there was there was probably a legitimate complaint about some girl that had some bad relationship with, like, a reviewer or something. I I think there was there's some, like, element of legitimate complaint there, but it blew up into, like, just the most ridiculous journalist? Yeah. Who reviewed the game, I think. I don't even wanna say that name because I don't know, like, 100% of the details. I don't wanna fuck it up, but the problem is whenever you get a a a movement like that, there's a whole bunch of riffraff that can come in When you're playing a game and, like, You're, like, you're,  [00:09:10] Speaker 2: chatting shit at another guy. Yeah. It becomes, like, kind of embedded in the culture. Is that is that  [00:09:15] Speaker 1: Oh, a little bit. Yeah. Because you don't see each other face to face. You have to ramp up the reality as much as possible. Yeah. So  [00:09:21] Speaker 2: you don't  [00:09:22] Speaker 1: think  [00:09:23] Speaker 2: like a left leaning kind of  [00:09:25] Speaker 1: guy. Yeah. From 2016 onwards, especially with Trump, like, every single fucking thing in life is, like, political hardcore now. Like, all of the culture was kind of moving more, wanna say woke, because that makes it sound bad, but, like, to be more inclusive and stuff. So, like, Black Panther came out and we're like, oh my god. Black superhero Yeah. Marvel movie. And Anita Sarkeesian and, yeah, women in game And I mean, some people just had a lot of opinions about Anne.  [00:09:49] Speaker 2: Right. Because they Just so many people there. Like, we gotta get some blanks in these movies.  [00:09:53] Speaker 1: The Wakanans? No. No.  [00:09:55] Speaker 2: I mean, the executives of this Oh. The the Jewish executives in the Jewish media.  [00:10:00] Speaker 1: Yeah. Jews controlled the movie industry. Yeah. It's like we're in  [00:10:04] Speaker 2: Palestine. We invented it. Yeah. Yeah. You're doing the 7 days a week for family hours? 10 hours a day?  [00:10:08] Speaker 1: No.  [00:10:09] Speaker 2: It's  [00:10:10] Speaker 1: like Like, my schedule is, like, 7 days a week, 8 hours, but I'm there's a lot of other stuff I'm working on too. So, like, I do 2 podcasts and other stuff, so I don't always have time to stream.  [00:10:16] Speaker 2: So how much into your week are you working? Basically, every waking hour. Who are the people that, like, typically, like, make up the like, that are in this community? Like, my community or yours? Excuse me.  [00:10:28] Speaker 1: Heavily male. I think 88% was our last survey. Probably  [00:10:32] Speaker 2: heavily, like,  [00:10:33] Speaker 1: White. Just because it's, like, tech and politics and shit. And they're watching 10 hours a day. No. Probably not all of them. Not most of them. But they are watching probably for like an hour or 2, which is a lot to consider. With a person. Yeah.  [00:10:45] Speaker 2: Yeah. Can you get you can get pussy up to this?  [00:10:47] Speaker 1: Yeah.  [00:10:48] Speaker 2: Do you think it's a good have you ever has a woman ever watched you, like, winning a debate and just become, like, you notice that her in the  [00:10:54] Speaker 1: I mean, this is dating and,  [00:10:56] Speaker 2: like,  [00:10:57] Speaker 1: fucking chicks? Isn't that all kind of, like, a debate? Is that what you're doing when you go to dinner? You're trying to make the best argument for why? They can't win?  [00:11:03] Speaker 2: Do you debate women? We all debate women. Life is a big debate against women. It's not fair. Is it No, dude. What happens is is you're winning, and then they cry, and then you instantly lost. It's not fair. It's fucking cheating. Uh-huh. Even if you're if if demolishing them with facts and logic. Is there one moment that you're, like, you feel it is a crowning achievement? Do do you think that that was my biggest dub? Or Like,  [00:11:26] Speaker 1: I mean, like, different debates feel good, I guess, for different reasons. So, like, there are debates that are big. Give you a lot of popularity or notoriety. They're a device that I, like, prepared very heavily for. And I feel like I do good, but they might not be as popular. So I guess it just depends. What feels like satisfying for you while you're it?  [00:11:47] Speaker 2: I  [00:11:48] Speaker 1: don't wanna step on any toes and and open the most divisive issue ever for a prior guest, but, did a lot of preparation for the Finkelstein interview.  [00:11:55] Speaker 2: People said I cooked them way harder than you.  [00:11:57] Speaker 1: I don't think that ever I don't think we've ever debated anything It's not Aussie debate.

What kind of vehicle do I have? You don't have the  [00:01:06] Speaker 1: privilege of not facing the disproportionate effects that black people face in America such the privilege of not being targeted, for the criminal justice system just because you're black. You have a privilege when it comes to driving. When we see the disproportionate effects that happen on pullover, on black people. You have a privilege when it comes to the medical field because black people disproportionately are affected by, by the medical field in terms of having you typically a higher mortality rate than white people. You have the privilege of, typically being born into a family with more wealth, white families,  [00:01:36] Speaker 2: have  [00:01:37] Speaker 1: a wealth of about a  [00:01:39] Speaker 2: 170  [00:01:40] Speaker 1: to $200,000 or black families. Only have a wealth of about 9,012. Arm $9,012,000. Do I need to keep going?  [00:01:48] Speaker 2: I think those are all, Well, you're taking a small sample size of saying that people black people get pulled over and it's not  [00:01:54] Speaker 3: a small sample  [00:01:55] Speaker 2: size. Definitely is. Nope. Nothing to prevent black people from health care in hospitals.  [00:02:00] Speaker 1: Did I say that black people were prevented from health care hospitals? But sure. Let's just let's just let's just let's just do not let's just dismantle your  [00:02:06] Speaker 3: first argument, first and foremost. I'm  [00:02:08] Speaker 1: talking about traffic stops, I'm using the male darkness study. Which analyzed 95,000,000 traffic stops across the US. Is 95,000,000 a small sample size?  [00:02:16] Speaker 2: And what and when they're not I don't know. Sorry. Answer  [00:02:19] Speaker 3: that  [00:02:20] Speaker 2: first question for  [00:02:21] Speaker 1: me.  [00:02:22] Speaker 3: 95,000,000 in the small sample size? No. But  [00:02:25] Speaker 2: I'm Right.  [00:02:26] Speaker 3: I'm  [00:02:27] Speaker 2: asking when  [00:02:28] Speaker 3: they  [00:02:29] Speaker 2: analyze them, what they find?  [00:02:32] Speaker 1: Yeah. They found that black people get pulled over more than white people unless it's nighttime when the dark, Mexican driver can't in which case the pullover rate even out. That is racist. That is racist.  [00:02:42] Speaker 3: I'm  [00:02:43] Speaker 1: saying you can't see the race of any driver in a car at nighttime because it's nighttime. Does stupid run-in your family, or is that just, like, you thing?  [00:02:51] Speaker 4: Yeah. But I  [00:02:52] Speaker 2: didn't get that  [00:02:54] Speaker 4: notice.  [00:02:55] Speaker 1: You clearly did.  [00:02:56] Speaker 2: Why? Because I am not positioned? No. Because you said because you said dumping. No. You said that you Eric. You said I didn't get that genetic Yeah. I'm teasing. I just wanna check up on that. Yeah.  [00:03:07] Speaker 4: Yeah.  [00:03:08] Speaker 2: Also, again,  [00:03:09] Speaker 1: analyze 95,000,000 traffic stops were analyzed. Thank you. 95,000,000 traffic stops were analyzed. They found black people get pulled over more than white people unless it's nighttime in which the color of this get the driver can't be seen and that and then which case the pullover rate to eave it out. They account for everything in the study. They account for time of day. Account for type of car. They account for whether or not a ticket was issued. They account for all of these things in the study. The study shows that there is a racial bias in the police system, especially when it comes to, police stops. There if you are white, you have a specific privilege in which you are not being, racial profiled  [00:03:47] Speaker 3: by the police.  [00:03:49] Speaker 1: And we're all really seeing, you know,  [00:03:52] Speaker 2: is it  [00:03:53] Speaker 4: in  [00:03:54] Speaker 1: general? Which one? Get pulled over more during the daytime. So when it becomes nighttime, it evens out. Accounts for that. I don't know if you heard me when I said that it accounts for all of this. 2nd, of all, it when it comes to nighttime, what they do is  [00:04:05] Speaker 3: they take places where it becomes nighttime at around the same around different times of the year. So for instance, I don't know if you know what daylight saving time is. But sometimes we get nighttime at 5 o'clock at night. Some it becomes night at, like, 7 o'clock at night. So they will have it, and they don't, like, bring the  [00:04:19] Speaker 2: Because you  [00:04:20] Speaker 3: talking like a brain dead. So I'm gonna talk to you like you are brain dead. So when it comes to I'm sorry.  [00:04:24] Speaker 4: I'm  [00:04:25] Speaker 2: sorry.  [00:04:26] Speaker 3: I'm I'm I'm giving you I'm giving you my full time time. Full time job is content creation. Sorry. I make money doing what I like. Sorry. I make money doing something I like if you hate your job. That's a thing that you need to reconcile within yourself. So again, so again, so again, talking about the study, because I have been able to pull up evidence for the claims that I make. Right? which is here is evidence So when it comes to pullover rates, what they did is they look at a specific place and they look at the pullover rates during the time of year when it's nighttime and the time of year when it's daytime. Typically, when it's 5 PM, the same people are going to be driving these roads because they're coming home From what? So they're looking at the time of day then and analyzing the differences between when it's daytime and when it's nighttime. And you know  [00:05:21] Speaker 4: what  [00:05:22] Speaker 2: they found out, Eric? I'll tell you what they found  [00:05:25] Speaker 3: out because I'm sure you're attention. They found out that black people get pulled over more when it's daytime, and the pullover rates even out when it's nighttime.  [00:05:31] Speaker 4: Well,  [00:05:32] Speaker 2: you can have a good night follow-up.  [00:05:34] Speaker 3: You  [00:05:35] Speaker 4: can try.  [00:05:37] Speaker 0: No no no tickets. No traffic impact. If you want to look at the entire culmination of data from the 95,000,000 stops, you can do that. But the overall I'm sorry. Are you not listening? Or You have the information. I'm asking you Are you are you not listening? Or if you want to look at the entirety of the data, you can. The overarching, points from the data stop is that typically black people are about 16 times more likely to be over than white people even when there is no infraction happening. So  [00:06:00] Speaker 1: tables. Go look at the data tables. So so if I'm black, I'm 16 times more likely to pollute for no reason. Based on that study, And you were saying that the, the work times, they drive home from work? Well, most black people don't work. Are you you you have, like, a safe job.  [00:06:21] Speaker 2: Do you have a source on  [00:06:22] Speaker 1: that right now? Hold  [00:06:23] Speaker 2: on.  [00:06:24] Speaker 1: It was under Say nothing. Call my  [00:06:25] Speaker 0: The group of fossil capital seems an escape. We've been under this past for so long that we rarely pull away and see the broader strokes of history which teaches us that capitalism and more specific capitalism facilitated by the engines of fossil fuel, of fossil capitalism, is not inevitable. It only exists as a tiny boy on the geological timeline. Even though  [00:06:45] Speaker 1: collapse. The everyday people have rocked and toppled the absolute and defying rule bazards.

Right. I don't even know. Like,  [00:03:47] Speaker 3: she undermined I don't even  [00:03:49] Speaker 2: know what I'm in.  [00:03:51] Speaker 1: You're cheap ass if you only donate 5.  [00:03:53] Speaker 2: About  [00:03:54] Speaker 3: Oh, I didn't think it was like that. I didn't I didn't take it like that necessarily. I feel like I don't know what I thought. I don't know  [00:03:59] Speaker 4: what I  [00:04:00] Speaker 2: think she was trying to  [00:04:01] Speaker 3: accomplish or what they were trying to accomplish by saying wording it like  [00:04:04] Speaker 1: that, but  [00:04:06] Speaker 3: maybe, like, yeah. I don't know. But, yes, I don't think that that was the what she was going for. Necessarily, but the She  [00:04:10] Speaker 1: definitely wasn't trying to get people to fucking donate  [00:04:12] Speaker 4: more.  [00:04:13] Speaker 1: Yeah. I'm just saying, like, That's that's how that's how I interpreted what Yeah. Okay. I  [00:04:17] Speaker 2: mean, there's different ways to interpret it either way. Either way, they failed miserably at, like, looking trying to convince people that this is a terrorist guy. Because they weren't people were not having it. They're like, no. You're sitting here defending the fucking CEO and how he didn't do anything wrong kinda thing. He's an innocent guy.  [00:04:34] User: It  [00:04:35] Speaker 3: failed.  [00:04:36] Speaker 2: Yeah. Nobody posted it, though.  [00:04:38] Speaker 1: I've been  [00:04:40] Speaker 5: but refused to, provide it to the general public. That's okay. And so when I, obtain the documents, and, looked through it, I didn't see any  [00:04:47] Speaker 4: reason.  [00:04:48] Speaker 2: Yeah. This guy really was, like, the only guy who  [00:04:50] Speaker 1: put  [00:04:51] Speaker 2: proposed this shit. Did that? Mhmm. I see his name everywhere whenever it's being referenced as the published version  [00:04:56] Speaker 5: of it.  [00:04:57] Speaker 2: Or maybe they made a  [00:04:59] Speaker 6: decision that they don't want the publicity. News for you. To the public deserves to know about.  [00:05:03] Speaker 5: The Oval Office focused on the health care, system  [00:05:06] Speaker 1: without saying to advance those  [00:05:08] Speaker 5: goals. But to see In this, the fact that it wasn't just a completely random act of violence As in fact, the mayor repeatedly asserted it was. If you look at, there's one particularly egregious case by CMS in how they were trying to paraphrase the contents of the document again without providing the underlying document to the public to come to their own conclusions saying that in this,  [00:05:27] Speaker 2: It's mainstream media, Gerald. They are  [00:05:30] Speaker 5: in and such. Very clear from it. I had  [00:05:32] Speaker 4: some  [00:05:33] Speaker 2: very  [00:05:34] Speaker 5: by grievances about the health care Great  [00:05:37] Speaker 1: moments, Lisa.  [00:05:38] User: Important thing  [00:05:39] Speaker 6: that our So that's why it's important to talk about the public. I  [00:05:42] Speaker 3: mean, on their part,  [00:05:43] Speaker 2: feel like every fuck up today  [00:05:45] Speaker 3: The fucking the fake prisoner thing that was CNN. That was  [00:05:48] Speaker 6: yeah.  [00:05:49] Speaker 4: That  [00:05:50] Speaker 1: you said that they came out and fucking admitted that it was a  [00:05:53] Speaker 6: fake? I don't know. Maybe. For some shit, it. I  [00:05:56] Speaker 3: think that they did because I don't know. Let me see. That's not a  [00:05:59] Speaker 6: question.  [00:06:00] Speaker 5: Yeah. Yeah. He made the cut out of a  [00:06:02] Speaker 7: 3 d printer. Dude, that's some that's some nerd Yeah. Are  [00:06:06] Speaker 1: you fucking serious?

[00:06:16] Speaker 7: Like, but  [00:06:17] Speaker 3: so that but that was a main  [00:06:19] Speaker 2: stream media saying it like that. So let me see somebody who's not fucking  [00:06:22] Speaker 5: mainstream.  [00:06:23] Speaker 7: And  [00:06:24] Speaker 4: see  [00:06:25] Speaker 2: if there's, like, any other 2 that  [00:06:27] Speaker 7: 26 is the real age.

[00:06:34] Speaker 4: I  [00:06:35] Speaker 6: don't know that. I don't know how to do that. It's definitely  [00:06:38] Speaker 2: yeah. I don't know how true that is at all. It's the it's a very, propaganda type  [00:06:42] Speaker 6: fucking channel.  [00:06:43] Speaker 2: But then again that's funny. I wonder if it's you. It was, like, 5 days later that they got it.

[00:06:56] Speaker 5: A budget or will need to cook meal when, dare I say,  [00:06:59] Speaker 8: idea.  [00:07:01] Speaker 7: Instagram, like  [00:07:02] Speaker 5: the handle  [00:07:04] Speaker 2: being I didn't even hear any of his fucking jokes  [00:07:06] Speaker 3: know we're talking  [00:07:07] Speaker 2: about, like, in between stuff more so.  [00:07:09] Speaker 5: Please do the same channel member by going to youtube.com/collected sports  [00:07:12] Speaker 1: I can't I can't tell if you just, like,  [00:07:14] Speaker 6: trying to fucking  [00:07:16] Speaker 1: like,  [00:07:17] Speaker 3: The Canadian, currently? No. The the  [00:07:19] Speaker 1: commentary, I couldn't tell if he was, like, poor or just  [00:07:22] Speaker 2: Oh, it was 4. Yeah. He was 4.  [00:07:24] Speaker 6: Yeah. Because, like, when  [00:07:26] Speaker 2: I didn't but I didn't hear any of the jokes at all. Like,  [00:07:29] Speaker 7: every  [00:07:30] Speaker 2: time he would say something, I started talking about something else, whatever. Whenever,  [00:07:34] Speaker 1: like, the end at the end of the video, whenever he's, like, telling everybody to look at the fucking scene, like, socials and shit, I was like, wait a minute. Know if he's what?  [00:07:41] Speaker 3: Yeah. Oh, yeah. He's just promoting him, I guess.  [00:07:43] Speaker 2: Great.  [00:07:44] Speaker 1: But I could I like I said, I didn't hear any of this joke. Something like it sounded like just based on the tone that he was, like, arguing  [00:07:50] Speaker 6: with. The community.  [00:07:51] Speaker 2: Okay.  [00:07:52] Speaker 6: I see. I see. So whenever, yeah,  [00:07:54] Speaker 1: whenever you said I respond to the socials and shit, I was like, wait. What?  [00:07:58] Speaker 3: Well, he was arguing with because he played 2 clips. He would play the clip a clip that was relevant to whatever the comedian was talking about, and he would  [00:08:02] Speaker 6: also, like,  [00:08:03] Speaker 2: say whatever about the clip that he played that was in, like, yeah. Yeah. He was making the same arguments or what the the comedian was making. But when he played the clip, that was relevant to the argument just to show, like, what he was saying. Maybe that's what he's talking about. Whenever he sent it to your  [00:08:07] Speaker 8: clerical.  [00:08:08] Speaker 6: Sounds like Probably. Thank  [00:08:09] Speaker 7: you.  [00:08:10] Speaker 0: That's really weird to have, like, many Super Like, I don't know. I guess, some propaganda types stupid says on here that just spread fucking, like, lies are reporting on CNN's lie. And I wonder if it's because they're, like, they're more right or they're right wing. And so just because CNN is painted as this, like, liberal, like, fucking media channel that that's why they're all on it, That's a  [00:08:26] Speaker 1: probably reporting on that just because, like, see, look. Us credibility. Because See you then.  [00:08:29] User: Uncredible. Yeah. That's I mean, yeah. That's too I mean, that's essentially what they're trying to do is basically be like, liberals back even though, yeah, they are back to do so. Whatever. But it makes it seem like there's half Americans that watch CNN, that agree with CNN, and then other half don't They're on the Fox News side. Mhmm. That's not how it works.  [00:08:47] Speaker 0: I'm doing a big ass fucking Oh, yeah. Donut. I like the same as the Amazon. I was gonna do that. I felt like there's,  [00:08:53] Speaker 0: I'm trying to see how you're the story when you're doing it. I think it's just a Just imagine you're a golf you know, That this is a person. Mhmm.

Goldfish  [00:09:04] Speaker 1: have, like, a fucking memory that lasts  [00:09:06] Speaker 0: Thank  [00:09:07] Speaker 1: you. I  [00:09:08] Speaker 2: mean, I don't think I think that's  [00:09:09] Speaker 1: fucking evolution in action right there. But at the same time, it's evolution in  [00:09:12] Speaker 0: reverse. I mean, does Clyde remember things from longer than 5 minutes  [00:09:15] Speaker 2: ago?  [00:09:16] User: I mean, I know, like like, repetitive, like, training, like, those kind of, like,  [00:09:20] Speaker 3: like, different tricks or commands that way they remember, but for longer than 5 minutes. But, like, what use is a memory to a dog about what happened 5 minutes ago? I guess. Or you know what I mean? I don't know. It's fine. But because a fish knows that you know, some some animals will eat them, so they run away. Right? Threw them away.  [00:09:31] Speaker 1: I was gonna let it slide.

Doing, motherfody?  [00:00:05] Speaker 1: Of controlling these patterns and living according to scientific pattern. Of choosing food between birds and eagles. All this seems opposed to the secret influences. The mobilizations of myths, to slip the field to be irrational, so characteristic of propaganda. But this development within the democratic framework can be understood clearly if we look at it not from the level of principles but from that of actual situation, If so far, you have concluded inside a democracy propaganda is normal and indispensable. Even if in the regime, nothing seems to make propaganda obligatory in external relation. There, the situation is entirely different. There, the democratic state will want to present itself as the carrier of its entire public opinion. And the democratic nation will want to present itself as a coherent whole. But that creates some difficulty because such desire does not correspond to a true and exact picture of democracy. Moreover, this implies an endemic permanent state of war. But, Lorenzen, it is easy to show that permanent wars established themselves at the same time as democratic regimes. It is even easier to demonstrate that these regimes express a strong desire for peace and do not systematically prepare for war. Possibly provoke general conflicts. But that the regime such as it is is not organically timed. It is Bowland's nobles. And it adjusts poorly to the situation of the cold war which is essentially psychological. Another circumstance in prison's democracy in the ways of propaganda the persistence of some traits of the democratic ideology. The conviction of the invincible force of truth is tied to the notion of progress and is a part of this ideology. Democracies have been fed on the notion that truth may be hidden for a while. But will triumph in the end. The troops in itself carries an explosive force. The power of fermentation that will necessarily lead to the end of lies the shining operation of the truth. This truth was the implicit core of the democratic government. One must stress furthermore that this was in itself a truth of an ideological conflict ended by making history because it imposed itself on history. This attitude contained the seeds of but was at the same time and still is, the exact opposite of current Marxist attitude that this one is true. Proof through history is nowadays regarded as He in whose favor history decides Was right. But what is to being right? One speaks of history, it is to win. To survive. That is to be the strongest. This would mean that the strongest and most efficient now and then is the possessor of the truth. Truth does has no content of its own. But it just only as history produces it. Truth receives reality through history. One can easily see the relationship between the two attitudes and how one can pass easily from one to the other. For if truth possesses an invincible power that makes it triumph, itself upon. It becomes logical. By a simple but dangerous step. That triumph is true. But and this is frightening. The consequences of the 2 attitudes are radically different. To think that democracy must triumph because it is the truth, leads me to be democratic. Between the democratic regime as opposed to regimes of oppression, its superiority will declare at first some to the infallible judgment of man and his The choices are certain. What amaze me is displayed again and again by Democrats, particularly in Democrats, When they see that a man selects something else, and the history is indecisive, In such cases, they decided to use information Because democratic reality was not known, people have made a bad Short. And even there, we find the same conviction of the power of truth. But it is not born out of thought fact. We will not establish a general law here. Sure. But we will say that it is not a general law. The truth triumphs automatically. Though it may in certain periods of history ignore with respect to certain verities. We do not generalize here at all. History shows that plain truth can be so thoroughly snuffed out that it disappears. And that in certain periods, the law is all powerful.  [00:05:10] User: Even  [00:05:12] Speaker 1: when truth triumphs, there's a triumph to itself because of its truth? After all, the eternal barriers defended by an integrity were in the eyes of history have yielded to Creon even if Sophocles had not exited. But in our time, the conviction of democracy and its claim to inform people collide with the fact that propaganda follows an entirely different performs a function entirely different from that information. And the knowledge base stops to not assume reality in the people's eyes unless they are established by propaganda. Propaganda, in fact, creates truth in the sense that it creates a main subject all the signs and indications of true believers. From other men, propaganda is really creating This means that fruit is powerless without propaganda. And in view of the challenge the democracies face, it means that supreme importance that they abandon their confidence in truth this such and similar themselves to the methods of propagation. Unless they do so, considering the present tendency of civilization, the democratic nations will lose the war conducted in this area. Democratic propaganda Convinced of the necessity for using the means of propaganda. Students of that question have found themselves facing the following problem. Totalitarian states have used propagandism to dominate. Domestically in order to create conformity and make for their public opinion and adjusted to the decisions of the government. Externally, conduct the comb board. Undermine the public opinion of nations considered enemies, and turned them into living victims. Beneath these instruments were used principally by authoritarian states. And with democracies whose structures seemed made for their means did not use them, can they help the use of our democracies? By that, I mean, that the propaganda of the authoritarium special would seem inseparable from that state. Must democratic propaganda have other traits? Is it possible to make democratic propaganda? Let us quickly dismiss the idea that a simple difference in content would mean a difference in character. From the moment that propaganda is used to promulgate democratic ideas, it is good. If it is bad, it is only because of its authoritarian content. Such a position is terribly idealistic and the principal condition of the modern world. The promise of means wherein But what they say, and this is a matter worthy of reflection, that democracy itself is not a good propaganda object. Not to bring all propaganda efforts to promulgate democracy have failed. In fact, one would have to modify the entire concept of democracy considerably make it a good propaganda object. Would be present if he was not. Also in person, will mention the following thought. The love that democracy uses this instrument, propaganda, Propaganda becomes democratic. This thought is not often expressed quite so simply and aggressively. But it is an implicit notion found in most American writers. Nothing can touch democracy. On the contrary, it impresses its character on everything it touches. This prejudice is important for understanding the American Democratic mythology. And the tentative adoption of this principle by other popular democrats. Such positions are so superficial and so remote from the actual situation They do not need any besides. Besides, they usually come from journalists However, retain the conviction that one can set up a proper propaganda system that exposes the democratic character. And does not alter the working of democracy. That is a double demand that one must make for propaganda. Democratic machine. Is argued that the first condition would be met by the absence of a monopoly and a democracy in And by the free interplay of various propagandists. True compared with the state monopoly and the unity of propaganda into totalitarian states, One finds a great diversity of press and radio in democratic countries. But this fact must not be stressed Too much. Although there is no state of big or monopoly, there is, nevertheless, indeed a private monopoly. Even when there are many newspaper publishers, concentration as a result of newspaper changes is well established. And the monopolization of news agencies of distribution and so on is well known. In the field of radio or a motion pictures, the same situation prevails. Obviously, not everybody can own propaganda here. In the United States, most video and motion picture corporations are very large. The others are secondary and unable to compete, and centralization still go on. It trained everywhere. This is the direction of a very few very powerful companies who control all the propaganda in India. In any event, as you have already seen, the state must make its propaganda. If only under the aspect of disseminating the need. Assuming that information is an in this what It is necessary that the information promulgated by the state be credible. Without credibility, it will fail. But what happens when a powerful private propaganda organization is not that some force advised information who can tell where truth lies. On whom can the citizen rely to judge the debate? It is on this level that the dialogue really takes place. The problem then is whether the state will support a private competitor who controls neither equal or superior to its own. That makes different propaganda. It may even be entirely legitimate for the state to suppress or annex, such Some will say freedom of expression is democracy. To prevent propaganda is to violate democracy. Certainly. But it must be remembered that the freedom of expression of 1 or 2 powerful companies that do not express the thoughts of individuals or small groups that have capitalist interests or an entire public, does not exactly corresponds to what was called freedom of essentially a bill. Is not the same instead of the speaker who has all the radio set in the country at his disposal. All the more, as the science of propaganda gives to these instruments, their shock effect had been non initiated. And are equal. I refer to the excellent study by Rivera who demonstrates the immense difference between the 19th and 20th centuries in this respect. Technique In In the 19th century, the problem of opinion formation through the expression of thought was essentially a problem of contacts between the state and the individual. And the problem of acquisition of a freedom. But today, thanks to the mass media, the individual finds himself outside the The debate is between the state and powerful groups. Freedom to express our ears is no longer at stake in this debate. What we have is mastery and domination by the state. Or by some powerful groups over the whole of the technical media of the famous formation. The individual has no access to them. Is the stake. What matters for him is which voice he will be permitted to hear. And which words will have the power to obsess in. It is in the light of this perfect analysis that one must ask oneself what freedom of expression still means in a democracy. But even if the state held old and instrumental propaganda, that has become increasingly common for political particularly so far as GE is concerned, in France. What terrorizing democracy is that it commits the expression of difference This is true. But it is impossible to permit the expression of all opinion. The immoral and aberrant opinions are justifiably subject to censorship. Purely personal opinions, and an even more certain political are necessarily excluded. No freedom for the enemies of freedom. Is a watchword then. Thus, the democracies create for themselves a problem of limitation and degree. Greeting will exclude certain propaganda instruments. For the fascists, the communists, and the enemy is in truth. The communists, the enemies of freedom by the bourgeois, the fascist, the fascist, the communist, and for the democracy obviously, all elements of democracy. Now there's an even more serious In time of war, everybody agrees that news must be limited and controlled. From that fact goes a unified propaganda. The problem that now arises is this. We have talked at the Cold War. But it seems that the democracies have not yet learned that the cold war is no longer an exceptional state. A state analogous to hot war. Is transitory. But is becoming a permanent and endemic state. There are many reasons for that. I will name only one. Propaganda itself. Propaganda directed the territories outside one's border is a weapon of war. This does not depend on the will of those who use it or on a doctrine, but as a result of the medium itself. Hopaganda has such an ability to affect psychological transformations and such an impact on the very core of man. That it inevitably has military force. Used by government and directed to the outside. There is no simple use of propaganda. A propaganda conflict is hardly less serious than an armed conflict. It is inevitable, therefore, that in a cold war, the same attitude says in the case of hot war. One feels they need to unify propaganda. Their democracies are called inner vicious circle from which they seem unable to escape. The other principal aspect of democratic propaganda is that it is subject to certain guidelines. It is not unfettered. It is an instrument not of passion but of reason. Footnote, by the separation of powers and so on. See, for example, titans in 20th century propaganda. By Ernest Chris and Nathan Leitisch who contrasted the appeal to the superego and to the irrational, by authoritarian propaganda with democratic propaganda. Which is directed at the ego. Therefore, democratic propaganda must be essentially truthful. It must speak only to truth and base itself only on facts. This can be observed in American propaganda. It is undeniable that American information and propaganda are truthful. But that does not seem to mean characteristic of democracy. The formula with which Americans explained their attitude is improved That is propaganda based on truth is more effective than any other. Besides, statement of a lie is not a typical trade of propaganda. There is an unmistakable evolution here. Lies and falsifications and useless and blessed. We have already said that. The use of precise facts is becoming increasingly common. Conversely, the use of nuances and a certain set of reveals an attitude to democracy. At bottom, there is a certain respect for the human being, unconscious would have becoming steadily weaker, but nevertheless still there. Even the most nontheologian, the Democrats respect the conscience of his listener. And does not treat him the case to contempt. The tradition of respecting the individual has not yet been eliminated. And this leads to all sorts of consequences. First, it limits stop again. The democratic state uses propaganda only if driven by circumstance. For example, traditionally, afterwards. But whereas private and domestic propaganda is persistent in its effect. Governmental and external propaganda evaporate. It's a such propaganda is not total. Does not seek to envelop all of human life, to control every form of behavior. To attach itself ultimately to one's A third trait of democratic propaganda is that it looks at both sides of the The Democratic advocacy is frequently close to that of his university. There is no absolute truth, and it is acknowledged that the opponent has some Some justice, some reason on his side. Question of nuance. There is no strict rule except in time before about good on one side and bad on the other. Finally, the democratic cop again or democratic state will often have a bad conscience about using propaganda. The old democratic conscience still gets in the way of burdensome. He has delayed even Thus, for the propaganda center democracy, he felt himself fully into the task. It is necessary that he leave Russia has seen still another difference between democratic and totalitarian distinguishing between contrasted incitement and The first consists of a senior of a sunburst by the instrument authorities in order to produce in the masses and in fact, in which those in power do not participate. This, according to last week, is the customary method of Conversely, the positive and excitement symbolizing the extended brotherly and a stimulus that springs from part the powers that the really feel. In which they want to make the masses participate. It is a communal action. This analysis is roughly accurate. All this represents the situation in which democracies find themselves in the face of propaganda. And indicates the differences between democratic and authoritarian propaganda method. And I must now render a very serious judgment on such activity. Democratic propaganda, All that I have to slide down is a truth ineffectual propaganda. Precisely, to the extent that the propagandist retains this respect for the individual? He denies himself the very penetration that is the ultimate aim of all propaganda. That are provoking action without prior thought. By the setting nuances, he reflects the major law of propaganda. And the assertion must be trenching into total To the extent that the democratic propagandist has a bad conscience and cannot do good work, nor can he, but he believes in his own propaganda. As concerns last well's distinction, the technique of propaganda demands one form depending on circumstances. In any event, propaganda always creates a schism between the government That same schism I have described in the book, The Technological Society, and that is provoked by all the techniques. These practitioners come to see the sole they can see the technicians. And to modify the structures of the state. According to Lasseo's analysis, propaganda based on contrast of incitation expresses a despotism. I would rather say that it expresses an irresoftness. But the famous massive democracy corresponds to that. Is that ultimately, even if one tries to maintain calm confidence and communion between the government and the government, All propaganda ends up as a means like which the prevailing powers manipulate the masses. The true propagandist must be as cold lucid, and rigorous as a surgeon. There are subjects and objects. The propaganda team needs in pushing and lets himself become a victim of his own gain. He'll have the same weakness as a surgeon who operates on a loved one. Or a judge who presides at a trial of a member of his own family. To use the instrument of propaganda nowadays, one must have a scientific approach. The lack of proof was the Clearly, after 1943, one could see from its contents that governments had begun to be needed. So some of the market's fundamental aspects paralyzed the convo of propaganda. There is, therefore, no democratic propaganda. Propaganda made by the democracy seems ineffective. Various propagandists are permitted to express themselves, they become ineffective with respect to their immediate objective. This in effect of this was regarded as a citizen to the Let us nearly emphasize here that our copy agenda is out classed by that of totalitarian states. This means that ours does not do its job. But in view of the challenging place, it is imperative that ours need effective. 1 must therefore abandon the traits that are characteristic of democracy but paralyzing for propaganda. The combination of effective propaganda and respect for the individual seems impossible. There is a last element, contractual mention briefly. Jacques, demonstrated that propaganda is totalitarian in its essence. Not because it is the handmaid of the totalitarian city. But because it has a tendency to absorb everything. This finding is the best part of this work. Paris, a Cola, 1950. It means that when one takes that move, one cannot stop One must accept and developments over the past 1000 years show it. That the democracies will abandon their precautions and their new launches in the hardly into effective propaganda action. But such action will no longer have a special democratic character. We must know it's only the effect that the making of propaganda has on democracy. To measure that, we must distinguish between external and domestic. We must not retain the illusion that propaganda is merely a neutral instrument that one can use without being effective. It is comparable to radium. And what happens to the radiologists? Is well known. The effects of international propaganda In the domain of external politics and the proper propaganda any diversity of propagandists. Even parties indentions to a foreign government and thus making propaganda different from that of their own national government. Direct their propaganda to the interior. But what character does this unique form of propaganda directed to the outside tape. And for repercussions has it on a democracy that conducts Can it be that it maybe exists? In the domain of information? We have a London proof nowadays that straight information addressed to a foreign country is entirely useless. Good note. We are talking here primarily of propaganda directed at the communist countries. Where the problem is to overcome national antipathy, which exists even between Sundays, Allegiance to a different government Have a flight? Restrict anything from straight information. To verify, we're you're smiling about is nothing against Oh, no.  [00:35:10] User: Definitely  [00:35:12] Speaker 1: not. Masses of a foreign country only through the myth. It cannot operate with simple arguments pro and con. It does not address itself to already existing feelings, but must create an image to us doesn't just have an emotional character that needs to be of the entire being.

I like that one.  [00:36:06] Speaker 1: Experience, it seems that the democracies have used it in the midst of peace. A freedom, of justice, and so on. All that has now been used and is all the more unacceptable because everybody uses these words. I understand. But the way I use about propaganda must be used. The meat of blood and soil was remarkable. Right.  [00:36:25] Speaker 2: What  [00:36:26] Speaker 1: specific made the server for democracy?

[00:36:59] Speaker 1: Only from this aspect does democratic propaganda have some chance of the penetration into other foreign countries?

I thought I didn't see for sure, but  [00:43:33] Speaker 2: that  [00:43:34] Speaker 3: spot was, like, in that weird position where it looked like it glitched. Yeah. They keep glitching and killing me. I'm like, what the fuck?  [00:43:37] Speaker 9: When I was a little kid, sometimes my grandfather would talk about World War 2  [00:43:40] Speaker 7: finally  [00:43:41] Speaker 9: started getting bombed.  [00:43:43] Speaker 5: The funny god, cartoons, and with the spinning spinning god head.  [00:43:46] Speaker 4: Oh,  [00:43:47] Speaker 5: yeah. That's the same.  [00:43:49] Speaker 7: Normal.  [00:43:50] Speaker 2: That's his  [00:43:51] Speaker 5: normal  [00:43:52] Speaker 1: content.  [00:43:53] Speaker 5: I don't know. This is, why  [00:43:55] Speaker 8: some  [00:43:56] Speaker 5: death is celebrated. Is the name of this video. Entire  [00:43:58] Speaker 9: populace with That's huge. Would they put people through the only tools we have to stop will turn to violence. Will be glad Talk to her  [00:44:03] Speaker 4: guys.  [00:44:04] Speaker 9: That's what I don't want it to come to. You should do everything in your power to avoid avoid the point in which violence becomes necessary. Mhmm. Because only then,  [00:44:09] Speaker 7: only with all  [00:44:10] Speaker 9: peaceful avenues have been  [00:44:12] Speaker 5: explored. He's like at like,  [00:44:14] Speaker 3: it's  [00:44:15] Speaker 5: like a tough guy look or whatever, like, biker look, and he's, like, very sweet.  [00:44:18] Speaker 9: It takes a lot of Anger. To overcome such disgust. Of feeling stabbing, a shooting, can all be such disturbing things to see. That's when violence is at its most explicit.  [00:44:22] Speaker 3: I bought you a diaper  [00:44:23] Speaker 5: a long time ago. Stroke of  [00:44:25] Speaker 9: a pen. However,  [00:44:27] Speaker 5: So I hate circling. Also, that's why I'm still on  [00:44:30] Speaker 3: the face of fucking because after all, I'm  [00:44:32] Speaker 4: just trying to get the fucking  [00:44:34] Speaker 3: mission. Paul.  [00:44:35] Speaker 5: Right.  [00:44:36] Speaker 9: Propaganda has limits  [00:44:38] Speaker 7: I  [00:44:39] Speaker 5: didn't know this was gonna be about propaganda whatsoever.  [00:44:41] Speaker 4: It's  [00:44:42] Speaker 3: probably.  [00:44:43] Speaker 9: So you can't rely on that forever.  [00:44:45] Speaker 1: Those with the real  [00:44:46] Speaker 9: responsibility to avoid violence Lie not with the people but with the powerful? Those with power can freely choose to do what right or wrong. The choice is yours. But the results  [00:44:50] Speaker 1: I turned  [00:44:52] Speaker 7: around  [00:44:53] Speaker 5: her time. I really did not really to to I think what he's saying.  [00:44:55] Speaker 9: That the world that would result from that is not a world  [00:44:57] Speaker 4: During the Visit people. Years  [00:44:59] Speaker 9: of the  [00:45:00] 20th century, there were 300 60 school shootings in the United States. People call We are still in the Q1 of the 21st century, and yet so far in the 21st century, there Thanks. 575 school shootings. That's Already far more than the entire 20th century.  [00:45:05] Speaker 2: Now  [00:45:06] Speaker 4: some of these Booking shoes. Were inspired  [00:45:08] Speaker 9: by each other and  [00:45:09] Speaker 6: powered each  [00:45:10] Speaker 7: other.  [00:45:11] Speaker 9: Yet they were all universally Everyone was disgusted by what they did. It was seen as monsters. Terror my regular people people like myself, as I have a child in school, Everybody knows that children don't deserve to be killed Well, most of us know that.  [00:45:14] Speaker 2: Not talking about the Palestinians. Now  [00:45:16] Speaker 9: Oh,  [00:45:17] Speaker 5: yeah. That's what he was referring to, like, some of the  [00:45:19] Speaker 3: children that  [00:45:20] Speaker 2: are  [00:45:21] Speaker 5: advisory.  [00:45:23] Speaker 7: We  [00:45:24] Speaker 5: all  [00:45:25] Speaker 4: know  [00:45:26] Speaker 5: children  [00:45:27] Speaker 4: don't deserve to be killed. Yeah. I know. Become a trend. But it's like a it's a thing right now. It's a thing where,  [00:45:30] Speaker 1: like,  [00:45:31] Speaker 5: majority of people in Gaza are kids. Seems to me like that  [00:45:34] Speaker 1: at least You know?  [00:45:36] Speaker 5: That's just, like, a big thing that's  [00:45:38] Speaker 7: being  [00:45:39] Speaker 5: said over and  [00:45:40] Speaker 3: over again all the time. It's  [00:45:41] Speaker 5: just, like, these are kids. Like, all of the babies have been  [00:45:43] Speaker 6: killed  [00:45:44] Speaker 3: and  [00:45:45] Speaker 7: gone.  [00:45:46] Speaker 3: So what the fuck?  [00:45:47] Speaker 7: And it's the same kid. So consideration.  [00:45:49] Speaker 9: There are  [00:45:50] Speaker 4: That's how you  [00:45:51] Speaker 8: look  [00:45:52] Speaker 4: in do a genocide. You fucking take out all the fucking  [00:45:54] Speaker 9: Of  [00:45:55] Speaker 4: course. You don't hear about the vast majority. People that  [00:45:57] Speaker 9: can reproduce or all the all the fucking Brother-in-law. That  [00:45:59] Speaker 7: entire  [00:46:00] Speaker 4: generation, the latest generation, couple of mothers. And  [00:46:02] Speaker 9: it was shocked Basically,  [00:46:03] Speaker 4: the rest of them die out. I believe maybe on the  [00:46:05] Speaker 5: way with about $1. I I was just just  [00:46:07] Speaker 9: about it in a local newspaper.  [00:46:08] Speaker 4: That's  [00:46:09] Speaker 7: it. The  [00:46:10] Speaker 9: murderers were never caught. The police did not seem to care all that much. Them, it was boring,  [00:46:12] Speaker 7: routine.  [00:46:13] Speaker 9: It was as if they already knew the killers would never be caught.  [00:46:15] Speaker 3: That's We  [00:46:16] Speaker 9: were already  [00:46:17] Speaker 7: written  [00:46:18] Speaker 9: off. It's a very good story. With someone  [00:46:20] Speaker 4: Not both  [00:46:21] Speaker 2: of those.  [00:46:22] Speaker 5: Yeah. That's what I was saying. Like, how, like, crazy they went trying to find the killer for this guy. Cops and everybody, like, the manhunt that went the CEO guy. That's why this is Alright.  [00:46:24] Speaker 9: Shooting of the  [00:46:25] Speaker 2: UnitedHealthcare  [00:46:26] Speaker 5: He was just talking about how people  [00:46:27] Speaker 4: don't  [00:46:29] Speaker 9: know. United's weren't there. It was as if they already knew they away with about $20. There was a single paragraph about it in a local newspaper. That's it. The murderers were never caught. The police did not seem to care all that much. Who  [00:46:32] Speaker 4: is this he's talking  [00:46:34] Speaker 2: about?  [00:46:35] Speaker 5: Just a random person. I don't know who somebody Some normal people are caught. It's just an example, basically. It's it happens all the time.  [00:46:37] Speaker 9: But it's a very different story when someone of note What I saw among the general public sees United for a  [00:46:40] Speaker 7: bit.  [00:46:41] Speaker 9: The media tries the pandemics and some tries  [00:46:43] Speaker 3: But some  [00:46:44] Speaker 9: partisan politics. But that does not seem to work.  [00:46:45] Speaker 7: Now there was one thing  [00:46:46] Speaker 9: political affiliation. It was a unification of sentiments that I had not  [00:46:48] Speaker 7: seen  [00:46:49] Speaker 9: since  [00:46:51] Speaker 7: the  [00:46:52] Speaker 9: that took 3,000 lives What if you were deaf at a similar reaction?  [00:46:54] Speaker 4: That's  [00:46:56] Speaker 7: a  [00:46:58] Speaker 10: hell of a thing,  [00:46:59] Speaker 9: isn't it? Imagine millions of people either celebrating your death or at the very least, not minding  [00:47:01] Speaker 5: it? It's a  [00:47:03] Speaker 9: scary  [00:47:04] Speaker 4: thought.  [00:47:05] Speaker 7: I  [00:47:06] Speaker 9: would imagine that it's at least disconcerting for the PSG of that CEO, especially as  [00:47:09] Speaker 7: they  [00:47:10] Speaker 9: try to believe that a society  [00:47:12] Speaker 3: Mhmm.  [00:47:13] Speaker 7: She feared for this  [00:47:14] Speaker 9: killer. A society that is more heavily wrong message, which will be the status quo. Plus more security. To the views of that CEO, but I'd much rather see you And I want that to be the reason that you are no longer in Danger. It wasn't like the CEO was a well known man, not like Osama bin Laden was. We all know that the vast majority of people who cheer for  [00:47:18] Speaker 2: his See, they kept doing  [00:47:19] Speaker 5: that. Oh, okay. Well, I felt like he, like, stretched his out real quick and just,  [00:47:21] Speaker 2: like, smack you. Have been though.  [00:47:23] Speaker 4: Yeah.  [00:47:24] Speaker 9: No. No.  [00:47:25] Speaker 4: And then I still fucking cut  [00:47:26] Speaker 5: it too close. Yeah. True. There's a combination, but for yeah. I saw that. I had clicked.  [00:47:29] Speaker 4: Yeah.  [00:47:30] Speaker 9: Workouts. And that's all they need to know. So it's not even  [00:47:32] Speaker 4: about recycled Dutch food and mushrooms and a new fucking potato. Mhmm.  [00:47:34] Speaker 9: Every  [00:47:35] Speaker 4: day. Oh, fuck. What the fuck?  [00:47:38] Speaker 9: When your chosen perfection affects  [00:47:39] Speaker 10: the  [00:47:40] Speaker 2: lie,  [00:47:41] Speaker 9: of ethical behavior impossible.  [00:47:43] Speaker 2: Mhmm.  [00:47:44] Speaker 9: And the mere act of doing it becomes an indictment.  [00:47:46] Speaker 1: 1  [00:47:47] Speaker 9: but merely because it's part of  [00:47:49] Speaker 4: So with the Nazis so much more.  [00:47:50] Speaker 5: Well?  [00:47:52] Speaker 7: I don't  [00:47:53] Speaker 3: know if we're  [00:47:54] Speaker 5: if we were making excuses. Those same excuses for them, though. So yeah. Right?  [00:47:56] Speaker 3: I guess.  [00:47:57] Speaker 5: But you know how we've demonized the Nazis over here.  [00:47:58] Speaker 7: But  [00:48:00] Speaker 2: but this  [00:48:01] Speaker 5: guy, every all of the somebody  [00:48:02] Speaker 7: else.  [00:48:03] Speaker 3: All of the the  [00:48:05] Speaker 5: rich people and the news people, they're all like, he was just doing his job, and he didn't have to be murdered. Don't go fuck it. I  [00:48:08] Speaker 7: already They're all  [00:48:09] Speaker 9: overseers of pain, suffering, and death. Some do it because of hatred. All others do it for profit. Mhmm. It's nothing personal to them. But, of course, to you, it's the most personal it can be. It's your life.  [00:48:12] Speaker 3: Mhmm.  [00:48:13] Speaker 9: In the end, though, matter how someone dies, the fact that they die carries an impact. And that works both ways. 10 days after the UnitedHealthcare CE was killed, the billionaire founder of the Mango Fashion  [00:48:15] Speaker 7: Hello?  [00:48:17] Speaker 5: Really? I didn't know.  [00:48:19] Speaker 10: I  [00:48:20] Speaker 9: Yes. Did these commenters know that man? Did they wake up feeling wrong before that day? Probably not. What he did do however, was accumulate 1,000,000,000 of dollars during a time when many of us are struggling. That's what those who did not care about his death  [00:48:24] Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  [00:48:26] Speaker 2: Understood.  [00:48:28] Speaker 4: All the way up to number 1 this time. It's  [00:48:29] Speaker 9: okay to be rich  [00:48:30] Speaker 2: and  [00:48:31] Speaker 9: successful.  [00:48:32] Speaker 2: Is  [00:48:34] Speaker 5: that good?

[00:49:02] Speaker 7: You  [00:49:03] Speaker 9: would not try to defend it as ambition or admiral in any way. It's only partially about health care. That's what others need to understand. I'll get into that shortly.  [00:49:05] Speaker 4: But we'll see what's  [00:49:07] Speaker 1: happening.  [00:49:08] Speaker 9: Connected, and we started hearing about how other countries free health care.  [00:49:09] Speaker 4: So  [00:49:11] Speaker 7: then they started  [00:49:12] Speaker 4: arguing that it's not directly  [00:49:13] Speaker 1: that. Clean.  [00:49:14] Speaker 9: On their profits.  [00:49:15] Speaker 1: It's fully  [00:49:16] Speaker 7: understood.  [00:49:18] Speaker 1: He says  [00:49:19] Speaker 3: But she's probably playing in Chicago or Dallas.

Someone won  [00:49:36] Speaker 0: Stopping Suffering and death. People  [00:49:38] Speaker 1: who may people  [00:49:39] Speaker 0: and investors. We  [00:49:41] Speaker 1: Hardly any people even made a decision on I don't know. How many how many people making $30,000 a year, but if actually make a shine a day, come on. Okay.  [00:49:44] Speaker 0: It's the systems.  [00:49:45] Speaker 1: forced him back to company to be this very work wish the system were different. That's an obvious lie.  [00:49:48] User: And  [00:49:49] Speaker 1: if the very people in charge of the system can't be blamed, then who can be There's a reason health care is so expensive in the first place. The CEO of the parent company of UnitedHealthcare said that he's super proud to be part of an organization that does so much good for so  [00:49:51] User: many.  [00:49:53] Speaker 1: Every one of us  [00:49:54] User: recognizes  [00:49:55] Speaker 1: Yeah. It couldn't be further from the truth. You answered, sir Dix?  [00:49:57] User: Nothing. How are  [00:49:59] Speaker 2: they? Oh, no. Well,  [00:50:00] Speaker 3: They get to decide whose  [00:50:01] Speaker 2: care is necessary, I  [00:50:02] Speaker 3: guess.  [00:50:03] User: And  [00:50:04] Speaker 3: sustainably.  [00:50:05] Speaker 2: What? Why?  [00:50:06] Speaker 3: Oh my  [00:50:07] Speaker 1: lord. First of all, insurance companies have no business making medical decisions. To decide what's necessary.  [00:50:10] Speaker 2: Yeah. They're not that's  [00:50:11] User: crazy.  [00:50:12] Speaker 1: While Americans struggle more and more every single year. So I don't wanna hear about this version of unsustainability. What he really means is  [00:50:14] Speaker 2: that  [00:50:15] Speaker 1: the level of profit margin that they currently enjoy would be  [00:50:16] Speaker 2: unsustainable.  [00:50:17] Speaker 1: So people are going to have to be sacrificed on that alter. The altar of sustained high profits. That's what you really need.  [00:50:20] Speaker 2: And  [00:50:21] Speaker 1: the news media flooded us with puffed pieces about  [00:50:23] Speaker 2: how  [00:50:24] Speaker 1: wonderful this other CEO, Brian Thompson, was. And how the positive reaction to his death was appalling, but was only 8 fringe few. That's a lie. Wasn't a fringe  [00:50:27] Speaker 2: view. Yeah. It was not.  [00:50:28] Speaker 1: Constantly trying to craft a narrative like that. When it takes Mhmm. Regular people as months So I would not celebrate his death or anyone else's death. They've been through worse than I have. We can't expect them to be in good motion, this robot. Motionless like the people who sealed their face with the stroke of a That we look, Sybil, that was anything but. In doesn't. CBS piece. It says  [00:50:30] Speaker 2: that  [00:50:31] Speaker 1: outlined, quote, their new based care to keep patients healthy. CEO's love lying to investors. I'm fully covered under UnitedHealthcare.

These  [00:50:37] Speaker 1: lies. And that's nothing compared to what others deal with. I can't even imagine the agony of dealing with financial battles. Thinking your cover, while you're having to endure a medical crisis or watching a loved one in I have  [00:50:40] Speaker 2: Medicare whenever  [00:50:41] Speaker 4: I got my fucking shoulder  [00:50:42] Speaker 3: surgery.

Itself. For its discontinuation would ask too great a sacrifice of the propaganda deed. A 2 0 limit is at himself. But we realized the propaganda can and does produce contradictory psychological results. This has been made clear but should be We shall therefore examine 4 examples of these contradictory effects. Aside from the fact already studied, it propaganda satisfies certain needs while arousing others. Can simultaneously create some tension to these others. We have shown how it was responds to the need of the individual in our society. Who lives in an unhealthy state of anxiety. I would consults the individual helps him decide his conflict. But it must not be forgotten that it also creates an anxiety and provokes tensions. Particularly after a propaganda of fear or terror the listener is less unstable emotional tension which cannot be resolved by kind words or suggestion. Only actions can resolve the time for future, or who will be questioning Zion and reduced capacity in case he cannot stand discord in opposition. A propagandist must try to find the optimum degree of tension in their side. This rule was expressed in the letters by the elders. Therefore, one thing I saw the patient with an accidental psychological effect very, and then cause the death. Too little tension does not push people to life. They remain complacent and seek to adapt themselves passively. It is therefore necessary to reinforce any challenge in some case. For example, concerning the effect of a military defeat. In others, to reduce tensions, they become too strong for people to handle by themselves. For example, the fear of air brake. The ambivalence of propaganda of creating tension in some cases and reducing it others explains itself largely, it seems to lie, by the propaganda and integration propaganda. The first would change the graphic file and caption must arouse feelings of frustration, conflict, and aggression. Which lead individuals to action. The latter did 6 men's conforming with his group. Including participation in action, relaying with the reduction of tension. Adjustment to the environment, acceptance of the symbols of authority. Moreover, the two factors can overlap. For example, a revolution Nazi party will employ propaganda of tension with respect to things outside the party. Propaganda of acceptance with respect to the party itself. This explains the attitude of universal acceptance of all that is said or done in the party. And the opposite attitude of universal challenge and rejection of everything outside it. And even with this as the second contradiction of which propaganda creates self justification and the good conscience, and at the same time, guilt free comes into bad conscience. We have seen the strength of propaganda develop from a furnace the individual a freedom of security and righteousness. Propaganda also stimulates guilt feelings. In fact, to develop said feelings is it possible to adjust of his own cause, his country, his army, and his group. For the man who feels guilty loses his effectiveness and his desire to fight. To convince a man that those on his side, if not he himself, commit immoral and unjust acts is to bring on the disintegration of the group to which he propaganda can be made against the government, the army, the country's war aims, even the values that underpinned by individuals. Bad conscience in this way. Strange as everything. Probably because of its passion with the In many event, propaganda creates a conscience among its partisans in the in 1935 in 1935, and even more so at the beginning of 1957, Sustained by campaigns on torture, colonialism, and the injustice of the French colony. This is characteristic of the French. This scene created by propaganda Absolutely, partially legitimate. So it's the essential cause of the division of the FLN.

[00:06:04] User: They are able to diagnose and troubles like, identify  [00:06:05] Speaker 2: what they need to do to do to recreate and, solve the problem.  [00:06:06] Speaker 1: It's  [00:06:07] Speaker 2: just a method of basically  [00:06:08] User: fixing issues in  [00:06:09] Speaker 2: programming  [00:06:10] User: or development, software development, or  [00:06:11] Speaker 2: whatever it is.  [00:06:12] User: So right now, what  [00:06:13] Speaker 4: you  [00:06:14] Speaker 2: just  [00:06:15] Speaker 4: did was you  [00:06:16] Speaker 5: were just  [00:06:17] Speaker 1: I  [00:06:18] Speaker 4: was  [00:06:19] User: not a distraction. No. It was not  [00:06:20] Speaker 2: at  [00:06:21] Speaker 4: all.  [00:06:22] Speaker 2: It was not accurate whatsoever. Oh,  [00:06:23] User: I saw my jacket on.  [00:06:24] Speaker 2: And that's not for That's not for That's not for Of  [00:06:25] Speaker 1: course. Being justice  [00:06:26] Speaker 2: You're probably hotter.  [00:06:27] Speaker 4: I was gonna say it comes back.  [00:06:28] Speaker 2: I was not I don't feel hot. Oh, yeah. Problem. It's been  [00:06:29] Speaker 1: seen poultry. Eviscerical, perf, mediocre, Propaganda must always fight against privatization, the feeling that needs man to consider his private affairs and is most important and produces skepticism toward the activities of his state. The owner may ideology, such as was right in Germany after 1945. The conviction that all is useless. It evoke means nothing. That it's not worthwhile to die for god's sake. Propaganda has absolutely no effect on those who live in such indifference of skepticism.  [00:06:30] Speaker 4: Mhmm. One of  [00:06:31] Speaker 1: the great differences between propaganda before and after 19 40 was that in Western countries, the latter had to face skeptical and privatized individuals. A modern state can function only with the citizen's digital security, and that's the can be obtained only if prioritization is erased. If propaganda succeeds in politicizing all questions, in arousing individual passions for political problems,  [00:06:32] Speaker 5: in  [00:06:33] Speaker 1: convincing them that activity in politics The church itself can participate in timespanning. Without understanding that they are propaganda. I do. The songs you demonstrate  [00:06:34] Speaker 3: You're welcome.  [00:06:35] Speaker 4: The  [00:06:36] Speaker 2: white.  [00:06:37] Speaker 4: Oh,  [00:06:38] Speaker 1: Same time, injustice, propaganda is an agent sir, of the regime. It produces this effect sometimes without intention to, sometimes deliberately, This reaction of hybridization occurs in the phenomena of the goal and skepticism when 2 opposing propagandists work on the same group with almost equal force. Then the privatization of that is involved in the. But in many cases, propaganda deliberately seeks to produce privatization. For example, a propaganda of terror seeks to create a depressing effect on the opponent, and leads him to adopt a fatalistic attitude. Footnote, the terrorist action of the OAS in 1960 2 was at risk. Nothing helps. That the opposing party or army is so strong that no resistance is possible. In this connection, the appeal to the value of private life is used. The feeling is aroused that one risks the death which has no meaning. The decisive argument of privatization, propaganda. Such arguments are useful for paralyzing the memory. They can give up the struggle and withdraw into egoism. They are equally valid in political or military conflict. One aspect of privatization propaganda by the state seems us even more important. When it creates a situation not His propaganda that neutralizes and paralyzes its his opinion. By reiterating a simple set of truths such as that the Egyptian scientists' political power is very participation in political controversy in the industry So what good business do? Why don't you Individuals receive their comfort because condensation is a spontaneous reaction of individual vendors eyes by reaction to criticism. But it is propaganda which sustains his attitude of privatization and skepticism, leaving to the government complete freedom to us as it thinks proper. The reasonable appeal of such propaganda will be defeated I read Because in general, man does not like to assume responsibility. It is enough to remember the sigh of relief that went through all the friends in 18 50 2. And again in 1958 when the similar authoritarian state paid Frenchman's opinion that they would no longer have to make decisions for themselves. But these would now be made for them by others. Thus to save in various ways by terror in the English journey. By political education in the Soviet Union, neutralizes the masses. Forces them into facility, chose them back on their private life in personal happiness. Actually, according to some necessary satisfactions on this level, In order to leave a free hand to those who are intolerant, in the astro, to the new earth, This method offers very great advantages. For the state. Chapter 5. The socio committed to look at  [00:06:39] Speaker 4: One,  [00:06:40] Speaker 5: propaganda.  [00:06:41] Speaker 1: Ideology. The traditional relationship. A relationship between propaganda and ideology has always existed. The pattern of that relationship became  [00:06:42] Speaker 4: more or less a style  [00:06:43] Speaker 1: before the end of 19th century. I will not give here an original or a specific definition of ideology, but will merely say that society rests on certain people beliefs since no social group can exist without such beliefs. To the extent that members of the group attribute intellectual malidity to these disease, one may speak of an ideology. One might also consider a different process by which ideology is formed. Ideologies emerge for adopting to degrade and vulgarize. And for that element of beauty, enters England. However that may be, it has long been known that some ideologies are compatible with but most of them are active. That is a cushion into action. Moreover, to the extent that members of a group may be their ideology to represent the truth, they almost always assume an aggressive posture in try to impose that ideology elsewhere. In such cases, ideology becomes bent on conquest. The drive toward conquest may arise within the society as a conflict between groups. For example, the proletarian ideology versus others within the nation. Or can you make targets outside? A national of Cardiology will? The expansion of an ideology can take various forms. It can accompany the expansion of a group and imposes itself on collectivities being embraced by the group. As with the Republican ideology of 1793, or the communist ideology of 1940 5, which accompanied the  [00:06:44] Speaker 4: army.  [00:06:45] Speaker 1: An ideology such as that of labor and a bourgeoisie. May extend by its own momentum on a purely psychological plan. In this case, the ideology assumes nonmaterial starting too. Meanwhile, penetrates the group that represents such an In this fashion, the ideology of labor helps bring about the bourgeois orientation of all Western societies even.  [00:06:46] Speaker 4: Finally, an  [00:06:47] Speaker 1: ideology can expand by certain other means. Without force and without setting an entire group in motion. At that point, we find propaganda. I Propaganda appears spontaneously or in organized fashion. As a means of spreading an ideology beyond the borders of a group. Or fortifying it within a group. However, in the White House, police's propaganda is directly inspired by ideology in both It is equally evident that what house here is to spread the content of that ideology. Republican does not need a lie So that in the course of history, you find This work in process is a relatively simple and there there's no Lenin and Hitler found the world in which the process great innovation, you must understand that the modern world is essentially a world all the means at Manav's disposal and that aims and means that they can protection of  [00:06:48] Speaker 4: man.  [00:06:49] Speaker 1: All in many cases, are more important than all. That is what and on the other to dig the doctrine itself a level of importance secondary to us With Hitler, one part precisely is the same point. There was 2 different things. First of all, a total In most cases, such former and customary aspects of the ideology as it images and vocabulary. He's been modifying national social studies diodesiology several times according to the requirements of comprehensive. Best is known when establishing Moreover, the claim launched by Raymond and Hitler touched on all prevailing ideologies, all of which now exist in connection with much each or not. It was no longer possible to turn back. Only adjustments The new relationship These new propaganda methods has consistently changed the relationship between propaganda and ideology. And as a result, the role and value of ideologies in the present world. Have  [00:06:50] Speaker 4: changed.  [00:06:51] Speaker 1: Propaganda's task is less and less than propagated ideology. Knowledge. It's an old being have its own balls since it becomes a common.  [00:06:52] Speaker 1: In political liberty without the respect that he would have for it if he believed me. He could be inspired contempt for these popular images and feelings. In his work, he must change the propaganda themes so frequently that he cannot possibly attach himself to any formal sentimental, political, or other aspect of the ideology. Audiology is only one of the incidental and interchangeable cons. It is often stated that the propagandist eventually comes to despise not the organization served by propaganda is not basic interested in disseminating the doctrine spreading an ideology, or creating an orthodoxy. It seeks instead to unite within itself as many individuals  [00:06:53] Speaker 4: the  [00:06:54] Speaker 1: The aim was the power of the pardon or state supported by the problem is no longer whether or not a political ideology is valid. The propagandist cannot ask himself that question. For him, it is senseless to debate  [00:06:55] Speaker 5: whether  [00:06:56] Speaker 1: the Marxist or whether the racist doctrine is true. Matters have no importance in the framework of propaganda. The only problem is that of effectiveness. Of utility. The point is not to ask oneself whether self economic or intellectual doctrine is valid. But only whether it can furnish effective catch words capable of mobilizing the man here and now. Therefore, when faced with an ideology that exists to the masses and commands a certain amount of unique, The propagandist must ask himself some questions. 1st, is this existing ideology an obstacle to the options we're taking? In many cases, such an ideology will indeed be an obstacle to blind action. It only to the extent that it starts some intellectual activity. No matter how feeble or provides criteria, no matter how insecure or judgment or action. In this case, the propagandist must be careful not to run head on into a promoting ideology. All he can do is introduce There's some hard to get. Reflective in  [00:06:57] Speaker 4: sunlight.  [00:06:58] Speaker 1: In a narrow country, colonized by black and Jews with the trauma You can become an ardent protagonist of Islam without  [00:06:59] Speaker 4: and profitable.  [00:07:00] Speaker 1: And because the time is already formed as part of public opinion, I would opinion you so uncertain and unclear as to the content that is coming out of the east that he follows the one that says the magic  [00:07:01] Speaker 4: words.  [00:07:02] Speaker 1: And proclaimed by the new organization in power.  [00:07:03] Speaker 2: But  [00:07:04] User: as we can see, but it's good  [00:07:05] Speaker 2: to but it's  [00:07:06] Speaker 1: just can take  [00:07:07] Speaker 2: one of 2 I'm saying how they did  [00:07:08] Speaker 4: it.  [00:07:09] Speaker 1: In fact On the one hand, an ideology can be expressed in a textbook, It can be reduced to a simple idea, neatly anchored in the popular consciousness. In  [00:07:10] Speaker 4: public  [00:07:11] Speaker 2: That video. Used to reacting  [00:07:12] Speaker 5: automatically.  [00:07:13] Speaker 1: Words such as democracy, country, and social justice can now set off the desired reflexes. They have been reduced to stimuli capable of obtaining reflexes in public opinion. Can turn from adoration to hatred without transition. They evoke past actions and aspirations. To be sure, if a formula is to be able to stimulate, it must correspond existing conditioned reflexes that were forged gradually in the course  [00:07:14] Speaker 4: of this  [00:07:15] Speaker 1: The propagandist limits himself to what is already present. From there on, he can use any ideological content at all, no matter Differences in application will be determined according to psychological, historical, and economic criteria. To ensure the best utilization of ideology in the realm of action. I have said that ideology is a complex system capable of evoking one aspect while leaving out another. The propagandist stability will consist precisely in making these choices. On the other hand, the propagandist can proceed by trans it. Some ideologies can indeed serve as a springboard for the creation of myths, the propagandists. Such transformation rarely takes place spontaneously. Generally,  [00:07:16] Speaker 5: ideology  [00:07:17] Speaker 4: is quite  [00:07:18] Speaker 1: vague. Has little power to movement, do action. And cannot control the individual's entire consciousness. But it furnishes the elements of context and beauty, It wags itself to myth by the complicated mixture of ideas and sound by grafting the irrational onto political and economic elements. Ideology differs radically from it in that it has no basic roots, no relation to human primitive myths. I've already said that it would be impossible to create a complete new myth. True propaganda, However, the existence of an ideology within a group is the best possible foundation for the elaboration of a myth. In many cases, a operation and a more pressing and decisive formulation will suffice. That the message must be formulated for use by the man media automatically contributes to  [00:07:19] Speaker 4: this.  [00:07:20] Speaker 1: The fact that the widespread belief is now expressed in 1 third, the number of words, and shout evigments of loud speakers using new force and urgency. The coloration supplied by psychological techniques the power of efficiency demonstrated by the integration in an action, the overall nature attributed to the construction of a new intellectual universe in which ideology is the keystone all that can be accomplished by the propagandist. In such fashion, socialist ideology was transformed into a by Leninist propaganda. Patriotic ideology became national news. And the ideology of happiness was transformed into myth at the end of 19th century. In this fashion too, the myth of progress was constructed from a group of papacy based on the law and neurology. Finally, the propagandist can use ideology for purposes of justice I have shown on several occasions that justification isn't the function of propaganda. The existence of a generally accepted ideology is remarkable instrument for providing a good conscience. And the propagandist refers to collective beliefs, The man whom he induces to act in accord with those beliefs will experience a feeling of almost unshakable self justification. Throughout the conformity with collective duties, provides security and the guarantee that one acts properly. Propaganda reveals this consonance to the individual. Renders the collective deemed perceptible, conscious, and personal for him. It gives him a good conscience by making him aware of the collectivity of  [00:07:21] Speaker 4: the needs.  [00:07:22] Speaker 1: Propaganda rationalizes the justification that man discovers in the prevailing idea and this in the power to express himself. This holds true the ideology of peace utilized by the kind of art. As soon as this ideology is used, everything, even hate to a succinct idea accepted by all. Our interested in objective moral of our state be outlined by an  [00:07:23] Speaker 4: ideology.  [00:07:24] Speaker 1: Democratic ideology sparked such an inquiry. But the relationship of ideology to propaganda has completely changed  [00:07:25] Speaker 4: here.  [00:07:26] Speaker 1: In a group in which modern propaganda is being made, man no longer acts in accord with his spontaneous ideology. But only through impulses that come to him from such propaganda. Only the ignorant can still believe that ideas, doctrines, beliefs can make man act without the utilization of psycho sociological method. Ideology not used by propaganda is trying to Torture of political enemies is implicitly of a detainee. Which expresses its dismay only in words. But not  [00:07:27] Speaker 4: in action.  [00:07:28] Speaker 1: Regard to the war in Algeria, it is well known that the most ardent of PHC Mole and then return it to expose the practice of torture during that war. Once they were in combat, plunged into action such ideas were relegated to a which on both sides accused the enemy of torture, thus legitimize its own actions took over again. The same is true for Christian ideology, which no longer inspires action. Christians are caught in a psycho sociological mechanism. I'm not interested in that. Those ideas remain pure ideology. Because they are not being taken over by propaganda. In this fashion, such an ideology loses its reality and becomes an abstraction. It loses all effectiveness in relation to other ideologies being used Moreover, in this relationship between radiology injection, we emphasize that nowadays, action creates ideabics. Not vice versa. The idealist who relate to past situations still would like to be mean. Through action, one learns to be mean in some truth. Even to formulate it. Today, ideology progressively builds itself around actions sanctioned For example, in order to justify certain actions in Algeria, an entire complex ideology was created. Thus, in various ways, all the result of propaganda Ideology is increasingly losing its importance.  [00:07:29] Speaker 4: In the modern world.  [00:07:30] Speaker 1: It is devalued like the propaganda used to promote. And cannot prevail against the competition. In the former because when used, it is broken up. Oh my  [00:07:31] User: god. You fucking lied. Personal  [00:07:32] Speaker 1: side. The same holds true for ideology as for guns. The transformation of the Marxist doctrine dotcom begins first, Lenin's and then Stalin's. Works such as those by Jean Chambre, Delachem, and Lukacs explained this evisceration of doctrine by propaganda very  [00:07:33] Speaker 4: well.  [00:07:34] Speaker 1: All those believed, known, and accepted is what propaganda has promulgated It is the same for ideology, which is nearly a popular and sentimental One can no longer establish anything at all on genuine ideologies and social One can no longer hope to find such ideologies as solid part of support for an aggressive manner of society. Ideology has become part of the system of propaganda. The bank depends on this can have decisive consequences.  [00:07:35] Speaker 0: Propaganda on the side they pride from the individual. Which I attempted to sketch in the preceding chapter. Obviously, I've collected consequences. Massive effects. If only because the mass is composed of individuals and because propaganda designs to act on the mass at the same time change People become influenced and quartered. This leads necessarily to modifications important for new changes in the concept of public opinion. For example, whether a favorable opinion of Negroes turns into  [00:07:36] Speaker 1: for note. This coincides with a well known fact that there were relationship exists between the structure of opinion and the size of organization of groups. Propaganda simultaneously commodifies the structure of the and make a group both sympathetic and peaceful. Modification of the constituent elements of publication. On the subject, I will not repeat for John Stipson has already demonstrated in his case detail based opinion. Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris,  [00:07:37] Speaker 2: Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris,  [00:07:38] Speaker 1: Paris, Paris, Paris, in Paris, 1983, To begin with, certain factors of change are easy to It is often been said that come with opinion forms itself while exchanges of opinion on a controversial question. And shapes itself by the interaction of these different viewpoints. But an examination of the effects of propaganda must radically destroy a central view of the formation of public opinion. On the one hand, as I've already shown, the question that Abigail takes upon itself cease to be controversial. Truths are pronounced, they do not dare discussion. They are viewed or not believed, and that is all. At the same time, interpersonal communications cease. And propagandize new communications no longer in place in interpersonal patterns, but in patterns by the propaganda organization. There is action, but no interaction. As I have shown, the propaganda and the nonpropagandy cannot discuss. No sociologically acceptable communication or exchange is possible between them. Finally, in large societies, in which propaganda is at work, opinion can no longer form itself except to be an  [00:07:39] User: essential Ryan.  [00:07:40] Speaker 1: Bye. No opinion was of any consequence unless the first communicated to him by the vast media of dissemination of propaganda. In due to reject the turn of laws. Public opinion and propaganda. New York, Henry Colton Company 1948. Chapter 5. One can easily see that propaganda plays precisely the role that you've assigned to public opinion. To reduce frustration, anxiety, and so on. And the propaganda directly creates propaganda by eventually creating, conforming, and externalizing inner opinions. But I don't proceed along any other way. The first effect I will try to analyze is what is state we call crystallization of public opinion. Shirley Stetson is right when he says, on the basis of a man process is not so simple as it seems. Frequently, it is said that a few scattered individual opinions suddenly by a mysterious operation unite in form of a defendant. It is then said that one of the elements in this process is propaganda. Stetzel has shown that things do not happen that way. But the pain does not arise from individual opinions. Here, we are faced with 2 heterogeneous colleagues. We cannot speak of a crystallization of individual opinion. Rather a vague, inconsistent, unformulated, latent opinion which one might hold raw opinion is transformed by propaganda to a true process of crystallization into explicit opinion. What does this imply? From here on, we will be in the presence of organized opinion having a serve cellar. There is no progression at all from a state of private opinion to a state of public  [00:07:41] User: opinion.  [00:07:42] Speaker 1: But only from one state of public opinion to another state of that same public opinion.  [00:07:43] Speaker 2: A  [00:07:44] Speaker 1: changing in versatile opinion becomes fixed. Is given strict orientation. Propaganda specifies precisely the objectives of that opinion and to their many needs, there In that way, propaganda also affects the individual reducing his field of thought and angle of vision by the creation of stereotype. But we're only vague in connections until intervention propaganda now take the form of ideas. This is all the more remarkable because propaganda, as you have seen, adds much more through emotional shock than through reasoned conviction. And, nevertheless, produces by that shock and ideological elaboration that gives great precision and stability to the ensuing appeal. But this hardening of the opinion is neither totally nor coherent. That is why I speak about scale. This makes even more sense if one keeps in mind that the process of propaganda can consisting of micro groups. Highly organized and endowed with great strength and conviction. These are precisely destined to crystallize opinemia. Help it to formulate and thus to play the role in scale. This was Lenin's theory. Crystalization takes place at certain points. Propaganda does not produce generalized and differentiated ideas, but very specific opinions which cannot be applied just anywhere. And the degree of effectiveness of a propaganda depends precisely on its choice of A working hardening opinion on a certain key point. One can control an entire sector of opinion. This heartening of opinion soon makes it impervious to all contrary reason, proof, and thought. Laden opinion subjected to such complicated even as well made, without discrimination. This will cause a thing in the past to the stage of crystallization. And from that moment on, opinion will no longer accept anything that is different. I already have shown that even approved that. Do nothing against crystallizing the thing. Such organization of opinion leads always to a certain unification. Opinion will begin to eliminate its own contradictions and establish itself as a function of identical touch words that will inevitably have a unifying effect. Besides, at that moment, individual opinions also changed. Where the hardening of public opinion distorts their originality. Details and nuances A good example of this process is the formation of press consciousness by Marxist propaganda. After the creation of Christ consciousness, like the foundation of information, of which I have spoken  [00:07:45] Speaker 2: above.  [00:07:46] Speaker 1: In the transformation of this blind's consciousness by propaganda, into a system. The criterion of judgment. Of even The stereotype. Abbogadov led to the elimination of all of the evil entire views and finally granted Labour's opinion impenetrable. To all that did not conform to the initial tariff. Present day class consciousness is a typical product of character leads us to a second propaganda effect on epidemic. By the process of simplification, propaganda makes it take shape more rapidly. Without simplification, no public opinion can exist anywhere in the world. The more complex problems, judgments, and criteria are, the more the case of individual. The more the case of individual, nuances and gradations prevent public opinion from forming. The more complicated it is, the longer it takes to assume solid shape. But in the case of such diffusion, propaganda intervenes with a force of simplification. Our routines are reduced to 2, positive and negative. In plain view, propaganda will simply place anyone with more differentiated opinions into one room or the other. For example, a man not altogether favored will climb communism is simply thrown into the fascist creep by propaganda. Even if he tries to think in terms of social justice. And even if he rejects capitalism, without being an ally of bourgeois imperialism, he becomes one.  [00:07:47] Speaker 2: Oh  [00:07:48] User: my god. You feel nice.  [00:07:49] Speaker 1: By simplifying the thoughts of the masses and reducing them to primitive  [00:07:50] User: patterns,  [00:07:51] Speaker 1: propaganda presents the complex process of political We have taken that as previously unavailable only to experts and the small number Discussion Footnote, news. Mason and Istov This 1935. Answers to problems are clear cut. White and black. Under such conditions, covered the pain points rapidly. Breaks, loops, and expresses itself. It then carries along on its irresistible course all differentiated and average opinions that have appeared too late for inclusion in the process crystallizing opinion. We already have seen how from the psychological point of view, propaganda reinforces and even creates stereotypes and prejudice The producers now, they cannot of the solely individual psychology. It is the individual in relation to others who has prejudices and their crystal Of course, prejudices arise spontaneously. Propaganda uses them for the formation of over the corner. Which in turn becomes simplified under the rigid separation very judiciously demonstrated by Stetson between individual and covered The distinction between stereotype opinions and profound attitudes leads us back to the distinction between public and private Stereotypes are the categories of public opinion. Profound attitudes, on the other hand, exist where people live by the laws And the 2 types of opinion can coexist without interchange or natural influence. We are thus thinking in two ways. As members of a social body and as individual. In the former case, one may say that we are abandoning ourselves to a thought that is not ours. And there is no reason why diverse opinions of that kind should be coherent or unified in the system. That is the task of propaganda. But we also have our private views. The effect of propaganda is to separate the two types of opinion still more. Ordinarily, some theater play between the 2 sectors continues, but this is short circuit with this nice and over. Relations of the local Why would you possible  [00:07:52] Speaker 2: Yeah. Because they had,  [00:07:53] Speaker 3: the more Hard plastic linings because it was, like, more vigorous. It sounds  [00:07:54] Speaker 1: development of the press in radio has considerably reduced the number of  [00:07:55] User: So are you, like,  [00:07:56] Speaker 1: The more individual the claims you confirm, the In this fashion, non psychological processes separated into 2 underrelated elements. I'm a painter to action. I've said on several occasions that propaganda aimed less at modifying personal opinions than at meeting people into action. This is clearly its most stunning result. When propaganda intervenes in public opinion, it transforms the public into an acting crowd or more precisely into a participating crowd. Often propaganda translates itself only into verbal action. This will be examined later. But what matters is that the crowd passed from the state of being mere spectator filled with opinions to the state of participants. Even if a moviegoer is taken with the film, he remains passive. He has a personal opinion of the future we see.  [00:07:57] Speaker 3: External.  [00:07:58] Speaker 1: The spectator at a bullfight is in a somewhat different situation. His participation in the killing ritual is sometimes passive, but sometimes active. When he storms into the ring, Robagadda goes much further and demands an acceptance that is not that of a set leader. It demands his support as a mirror. His active participation is a maximum. Firdna, On the subject of passive appearance, alas, in remarkable example is contained in a pamphlet by the OAS, February 10, 1962. Which states that we do not ask all officers to join our ranks but merely to show no zeal from applying government direction. Abigand evidently plays its part when a normal spontaneous development of opinion itself into private noncollective attitudes. Only very rarely is opinion by itself. It has often been said that propaganda is not create attitudes that merely uses them. Taking the term in the specific sense of social psychology, I must agree but the fact is not so simple. It is evident that propaganda itself does not modify either. But when propaganda needs to action, it modifies, first of all, the response that would otherwise be a direct result of the fundamental attitude. The individual expressing his attitude would not act, but under the influence of other which, if often repeated, will change his behavior pattern. Moreover, when the individual is engaged in action, the has been set in motion by propaganda, he cannot escape counterbloat an orientation  [00:07:59] Speaker 2: different from that  [00:08:00] Speaker 1: preparation for action. Is only an attitude. But this attitude is also determined by the action which is engaged and by the social context The continuous and automatic action into which propaganda plunges the individual Undoubtedly also creates attitudes that determine further actions. Does this progression from opinion to action through the channel of propaganda take place? New is one of the few. Attitudes affect behavior. If their force is so great, there's an irreducible except by action. This force, which may be weak or strong in the beginning, accumulates when the individual feels that action is necessary. For he to show the action,  [00:08:01] Speaker 2: which I do this for  User: him.  [00:08:02] Speaker 1: In short, the achievement of a prepared response is only the last of the series of preliminary stages, which though necessary for the final action to take place, do not guarantee that it will. Seeing this perspective, action is the result of a certain number of coordinated influences created by  [00:08:03] Speaker 3: footnote.  [00:08:04] Speaker 1: One must note for the individual, a specific preord simple task we undertake at a given moment. From the moment propaganda succeeds in personalizing its appeal, the individual who feels concerned is placed in a situation that demands a decision Mao has achieved this completely with his Oh  [00:08:05] User: my god. I'm doing  [00:08:06] Speaker 2: this.  [00:08:07] Speaker 1: Propaganda can make the And at the same time, top again, the show's important. Individual who burns with desire for action but does not know what to do is a common type in our society. Must do act for the sake of justice. Peace, conquest. Does not know how. If propaganda can show him this how, it is Action will surely follow. The individual also must be convinced of the success of his action or of the possible reward or satisfaction we get from him. Man relax when he feels that a certain result needs to be obtained. And that the need is urgently. Advertising demonstrates it to him in the commercial domain. Propaganda demonstrates it in politics. Finally, now when we help in this progression through action by example. By similar action all around him. But such similar action did not come to his attention except to the media of  [00:08:08] Speaker 2: propaganda.  [00:08:09] Speaker 1: This is undoubtedly the true pattern in many aspects. But one element overlooked here is essential in my view The element of the mass crowd.  [00:08:10] Speaker 2: Put out  [00:08:11] Speaker 1: Man subjected to propaganda would never act if he were alone. Du makes an analysis of man by himself. Though the mechanisms that he reveals can work only with collective man. An individual can feel the urgency of an action only it promises to be effective because it is being carried out by many. He cannot engage in action except with others. This means that if propaganda is to lead to action, it must also have a collective impact. Stuff. That includes is composed of 2 main factors. 1, propaganda creates a strong integration of the group. And at the same time activates the preoccupations of that group. The mass media provoked an intense participation in the life of the group and in collective activities. They provide a strong feeling of community. In our society, the individual communicates with the group only through the mass media of information. The indispensable psychological contact among members of the group is produced only by news media. For under mass society, individuals have a tendency to withdraw from each other more and more. Their relationship is only artificial. It is only the product of the information media. Spontaneous relationships change character when they become organized. Systematized, and deliberate. At this point, personal relations tends to create unanimity in the literal sense. And such unanimity always takes on a force of expansion. And the group requires a certain conformity. It inevitably experiences the meaningful pursuit through action. That moment, the psychological con the communication of creating what nearly a feeling of community. If such truth dealt with internal verities, it would not push the victim into action. But at the same time as a mass media, the great the group, they place it in relation to the press. After all, the content of present day is a human being, but means of the moment. But this goes much further when the media are purposely used for propaganda. Stetson has actively said that the stereotypes of propaganda immediately appear to have the significance of actuality. Even in actuality made aggressive and further an actuality that is present.  [00:08:12] Speaker 3: A good thing is some of  [00:08:13] Speaker 1: psychologically unanimous and finds itself face to face with such planned actuality feels concerned to the highest degree. What is this actuality? It is precisely the world in which the group itself and its fittering god. And in which the group has the possibility of acting. And propaganda integrates the group into an actuality if necessarily leads it to acting that actuality. The group cannot remain constant and we can take  [00:08:14] Speaker 2: actuality.  [00:08:15] Speaker 1: This group has no other frame of reference by which it could take a different position. In other words, it has only one point of view toward that actuality. The group, therefore, cannot consider its subspecies eternal purpose because its frame of reference is furnished by the very propaganda that you might see in the actuality the first place. And the group cannot judge its own position. At that moment, to participate in any group or whatever is to submit to actuality. To become a man without past or future. They have no concern other than action, no belief other than that promise. Giving by propaganda concerned with president. 2, the other aspect of the progression to action is the great power that propagandicates to opinion. This opinion is no longer a myth, but time is unsure of itself. Spreading slowly by word-of-mouth can be difficult for opinion surveys to pinpoint. It is projected outside itself. Meets itself, and hears itself on the screen and the airwaves. Invested with power of  [00:08:16] Speaker 3: grandeur magnificence.  [00:08:17] Speaker 1: Such opinion runs to me with itself. Certain now that it views truth, because it is seen itself revealed and promulgated on all sides on how When can they say without exaggeration, the propaganda replaces the leader of the This is not a banal assertion that propaganda is the instrument of the unit group. Helps to make a leader. It means that in a group without a leader, but subjected to propaganda, the sociological and psychological effects are the same as if they were a viewer. Propaganda is a substitute for him. If we remember the innumerable roles played by the  [00:08:18] Speaker 3: group leader,  [00:08:19] Speaker 1: can summarize them as kimbo yangga,  [00:08:20] Speaker 2: chapter 10.  [00:08:21] Speaker 1: The leader of a group  [00:08:22] Speaker 3: is the  [00:08:23] Speaker 2: main first  [00:08:24] Speaker 1: The galvanizer that the people's commissar was only assertive and administrative.  [00:08:25] User: Oh my god. What you fuck, Garrett?  [00:08:26] Speaker 1: Entirely abnormal. But the substitute for the true leader by propaganda and exists through it. Once comes the possibility of having a chief present when he is absent. Merely an effort integrated into the circuit of propagandism, sequences. The portraits of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Roosevelt, play an abstract with sufficient role but the effects that can be accepted from the leader's presence are obtained instead. This is the second element of the progression from a female to direct action. 3, propaganda and grooming. I've selected this leather bag heading because I cannot undertake a complete study of the pump again effects on the aggregate of all groups in society. For that, I will need a complete theoretical and experimental sociology. Besides, with regard to the propaganda effect, one must distinguish between the groups that make it and the groups that are subjected to it. Often, the 2 elements are closely related. This study will examine 3 examples. Parties, the world of labor, and projections the partitioning of groups, All propaganda has to set off its group from all the other groups. Here we find again the fallacious character in the intellectual communication press radio.  [00:08:27] User: Nice,  [00:08:28] Speaker 2: pathetic. Fuck you.  [00:08:29] Speaker 3: Propaganda of his group.  [00:08:30] Speaker 1: According to an IFOP survey, number 1, 1954, Everybody is satisfied with his own propaganda. Similarly, Lazarus fell in his survey of radio broadcasts. Such the case of programs designed to acquaint the American public with the value of each of the ethnic minority groups in the American population, Good note. The effects of radio on public opinion in print radio, and film in a democracy. Chicago, University of Chicago  [00:08:31] Press,  [00:08:32] Speaker 1: 1942, The point was to demonstrate the contributions he group was making. For example, the Irish team did a program about the Irish. But rarely about anybody else. In the same way, the communist press is very popular communist voters, but protest and  [00:08:33] Speaker 3: press are partisan.  [00:08:34] Speaker 2: What  [00:08:35] Speaker 1: happens Those who read the press of their group and listen the radio of their group are constantly reinforced in  [00:08:36] User: their So fucking mad.  [00:08:37] Speaker 3: And right.  [00:08:38] Speaker 1: That its actions are justified. Thus, it remains to strengthen. At the same time, such propaganda contains elements of criticism and reputation of other groups. Which will never be read or heard by member of another  [00:08:39] Speaker 2: group.  [00:08:40] Speaker 1: That the communist attacked me those policies with solid arguments had no effect on Nadeau's party. But the supporters of Dido did not mean he. The  [00:08:41] Speaker 3: divorce law paper, the figure all  [00:08:42] Speaker 1: will contain valid criticism of and genuine facts about dictatorship in the Soviet Union. Will never reach a communist. If this criticism one's neighbor, which is not heard by that neighbor, is known to those inside the group that expresses it. The anti communist will be constantly more convinced of the evilness of the communist. Than vice versa. As a result, people ignored the gun laws. They see altogether to be open to an exchange of reason, arguments, points of view. This double play on the top together proving the excellence of one zone group and the evilness of the others, produces an increasingly stringent partitioning of our society. A religious partitioning. The partitioning of political parties or finances. Beyond that, a partitioning of nations and at the summit. A partitioning of blockers of nations. But this diversity of levels and objectives in no way changes the basic law according to which the more propaganda there is, the more partitioning there is.  [00:08:43] Speaker 0: Here's the subjects. And justifies oneself. One must not think incidentally that such part is in conflict with the formation of public opinion. Although propaganda partitions society, it affects opinion and transcends the groups in which it operates. In the first place, it maintains its effectiveness toward the of undecided who do not yet belong to a group. Then, too, it is possible to affect those who belong to a group of a different sort. For example, communist propaganda that will not affect the militant  [00:08:44] Speaker 1: in his capacity as Frenchman. I influence him with regard to capitalism or the liberal system. This is particularly important because there is a difference of level between the groups. For example, a nationalist propaganda results in building a barrier against other nations. However, domestically, it respects the isolation of imperial groups, but still affects them by making them join a common collective movement. This is a process comparable to the reach and The national propaganda is purposely effective inside the nation. And changes public opinion. For a historic propaganda or religious propaganda is effective on another plane. Each having the power to modify public opinion on a certain level. And to produce a sociological partition in Northern Europe. But only a superior group can affect other groups. That is why with respect to the key current power blocks, east and west, we're now deciding security. The epidemic can only have the effect of increasingly separating. A well organized propaganda will work with all of these different elements. This explains the new algorithm with some propagandist. For example, the USSR. On one side, in the papers with large circulation or on the label. One finds only ecstatic praise of the regime or vague criticism regime. One can find a line of precise and impartial information in these rooms. How can this be rather than tolerated? It can be explained only by practitioner. One must tell the public about the grandeur of the revolution and the excellence of the without any connection to Soviet reality as a whole. A disappointing personal experience is only an accident without meaning. Danger. Aims at showing department's vigilance, its knowledge of detail, its its centralized control, its demand for communist perfection. Is aimed at the massive technicians broken up into groups of specialists. Such propaganda asserts that the regime is excellent that all services are working very well except the service in question. Medical for the doctors and so on. How is such a development possible Precisely by virtue of the partition which to such a large extent propagandist work. Because one knows that the doctor will not read emergency medicine. And because one knows that the public at large will not read any of the specialized journals, and because one knows that the Ukrainians will not read Georgian newspapers, one can. According to necessity, make contradictory decisions in in and over time. Obviously, this procedure further increases separation. Everyone stops speaking the language of the others. With all means of being communication remains. Different facts are given to different people. The basis of judgment are diverse. The orientations are on process. There is no longer a meeting point within the confines of the same propaganda or this propaganda scientifically. Not spontaneously, as in the case study earlier, develops divided lines. Establishes psychological separations between groups, and does all this under a common collective quote called unreality point. And verbal fiction. Effects on political parties. What happens when a political party stops acting more or less haphazardly? Starts to make systematic propaganda? And instead of trying to win votes at election time, begin to mobilize public opinion in a more permanent fashion. Actually, in the Democratic nations, practically, no party has tried this. But we can see the emergence of parties grafting themselves under old ones, so replace And these new parties have such their predecessors did not have. The transformation is taking place in the political parties of the United States For about a dozen years now, they have been making systematic propaganda but it is still too early to tell what transformations it may entail in the parties themselves. Therefore, we will instead those parties that make propaganda. As distinguished from those that do not. And consider that their structure derives partially from their need to make of a game. The party that makes propaganda must, first of all, have the means to tone. It is necessary that the part presents itself as a community in which everybody has a set function. And that its members at the bottom be rigorously organized and strictly obedient. If one wants to reach public opinion constantly, one must pursue with the help of sections and cells. The system of committees, which express themselves weekly, leads only to sporadic and fragmentary action. In addition, propaganda demands vertical liaison among the parties of organizations. This vertical liaison permits both homogeneity of propaganda and speed of application. And we have seen that speed of action is essential to the economy. Conversely, it deal with the effect of propaganda in creating isolated social and local groups. Any horizontal liaison inside the party will be disastrous. Those at the base of the party would not understand why one propaganda is made in one place. Another elsewhere. On the contrary, the partitioning by propaganda must correspond to the partitioning within the party. And the only liaison system must be vertical. More important still is a system of executive contracts. This produces from the beginning a schism between the contracts and the voters or sympathizers corresponds precisely to the separation into subjects involved in. Propaganda makes its agent a subject to make the decisions and uses those systems that must obtain certain results but the agent looks upon the mass of potential voters as sympathizers as objects. He manipulates them. Works on them, tests them, changes the several lines. For your sympathy. Propaganda, therefore, intensifies this information by creating the image of a reader and investigating it without the the presence and our mission. Only sense and anticipate. Any party that avoids this personalization of power loses a probably decisive card. We have seen this in the American election of 1952, the 1000 hour. And tied to the organization of propaganda itself. In connection with certain parties, Louverge speaks of a second power. An obscure power that sometimes dominates the direction of the party. This second power sometimes consists of influential man on the paper whose This fact needs to be generalized. In modern parties, the 2nd power is likely to consist of the core of propagandists. The same holds true for the state itself. A position, not with our occasional serious handrails, for they are in one and the same time the hub of the entire party, and this was on death row. These are the principal effects of the adoption of modern propaganda. The structure of a political party. With regard to the relative effects on the interplay of parties in the The decisive development is a high cost to propaganda. Propaganda is becoming more and more expensive. Partly because of the bombing need partly because of the instruments required, All parties may stick to traditional low level propaganda. Posters, newspapers, newspapers, and go to the government for the more expensive media, radio, TV, such as the case in France. Under such circumstances, there is a state in equilibrium that are precarious. The situation is in a tense unstable. If one party resorts to propaganda, the whole edifice tumbles. A single party takes big propaganda action while the others cannot lead group or put in operations and necessary to the apparatus because they left money. Of the union. For the communist party This is clearly a man who denies it. We are base to base an overwhelming and strong part of the government. This body continues to grow stronger as it becomes richer and it seems more solid propaganda foundation. It definitely jeopardizes the democratic system. Even if it has no dictatorial ambitions. For the other party They have incapable of regaining the mass of those 75%, more or less undecided are increasingly unable to use fake propaganda. This happened from the progress in the communist parties in France and Italy came to an end after 1948. With a regression of their propaganda. Which was by no means attributable to their past mistakes. The second hypothesis is the opposition parties find a reply the propaganda. The propaganda. But this can only lead to a regrouping of forces, which is hard to obtain because internal squabbles are stronger than the need for a common counter propaganda. As in France, between 1949 into 1958, or by an appeal to the government which made them put communication means into and to oppose some totalitarian propaganda. This was a case in Belgium in connection with Brexit counter propaganda. The third hypothesis, a party or a block of parties almost as powerful as the would be runaway party, starts propaganda before it is pushed to the wall. This is the case in the United States, and it might be in France if the regrouping of the right should become stabilized. In that situation, one would necessarily have For financial reasons, a democracy reduced to 2 part It being inconceivable that a larger number of parties would have some sufficient means to make such propaganda. This would lead to a bad podcast. Oh  [00:08:45] User: my god. You seem to have gotten  [00:08:46] Speaker 1: for technical propaganda reason. This implies the exclusion of important in the future. Not only are secondary pardons progressively eliminated, but this becomes impossible to organize any political groups with any chance at all of making the curve. In the midst of a considerable power and the forces of work, it becomes increasingly difficult to establish a new program. So On the other hand, such a group would mean from the beginning a great deal of money. Many members of great power, Under such conditions, a new party could only be in Tanzania. Emerging fully grown from Zeus's core. A political organization would have had to collect money for a long time. To have bought propaganda instruments in United States members, the it made its appearance as a party incapable of resisting the pressures of those who possess the media. Not just the mere organization of a new party is becoming increasingly difficult, so is expression of a new political idea. Idea is no longer exist except through the media of information. And the latter are in the hands of the existing parties now truly revolutionary or new doctrine has any chance of expressing itself. That is an interesting Yet innovation was one of the principal characteristics of democracy. Now because nobody wants it any longer, it tends to disappear. One can say that propaganda almost inevitably leads to a 2 party system. Not only would it be very difficult for several parties to be rich enough to support such extensive campaigns of propaganda, But also, propaganda tends to schematize public opinion. When there's propaganda, we find fewer and fewer nuances in findings in detail in doctor. Rather, opinions are more incisive There is only black and white. Yes and no. Such a state of public opinion needs directly to a 2 party system and the disappearance of a multiparty system. The effects of propaganda can also be clearly seen in view of what Hubertje calls the party with the majority mandate and the party without that mandate. The party with the majority mandate controlled narrowly should command an absolute majority in parliament. Is normally the one that has been created by propaganda. Propaganda's principal Trump's then stood out of the hand of the other party. The latter can do then is to make them a biologic propaganda. That is a false propaganda that is truly artificial. Considering what you have said about the relationship between propaganda and reality. In other words, the party out of power must pick an artificial issue. In that case, we find ourselves faced with 2 completely propaganda. On one side is a propaganda powerful and techniques, but really in its ends and modes of expression. Propaganda strictly integrating into a given social group, performance, and status. For excessive entertainment and expressions, a propaganda aimed against the existing order, against the state. Against prevailing group standards. But one must never forget that the party with the majority mandate which he just seeks propaganda to that mandate and even views the mandate as a propaganda aim is nevertheless also the creation of propaganda. Which hides a dead man in a given setting and for a long period of time. Finally, a last word on the financial problems and verification. It is improbable that contributions of love would enable a party to pay for the increasingly expensive propaganda media. The parties are therefore forced to look for aid either to capitalists and thus indenture themselves through a financial oligarchy or to a government, national, or foreign. In the second case, the state comes close to appropriating the instrument. The state then lends them to those who ask for them which is very democratic and best for its secondary parties to live. But this leads to an unstable situation, as I said earlier. And the state is then increasingly forced to exercise censorship over is being said by means of his instrument. This censorship will be increasingly rigorous as the state itself is forced make more propaganda. This leads us to examine the hypothesis of a state that ceases to be moved in the ideological domain. And assumes a doctrine or ideology of its own. At that moment, propaganda by mistake is imposed on all parties. We'll be sure we are still dealing with propaganda. We have seen in the past decades with regard to all state that power must first be used to shape public opinion. Without pushback or not offer. Thus are the beginnings of the Nazi state. Or a popular democracy, A certain competition continued between the propaganda of the state. And that of the parties out of power. But in such competition, the state necessarily emerges victorious. It increasingly denies the use of the mass media of communication for the opposition party. It works on public opinion until the moment arrives, and simply suppress opposition parties without clear. The state can work on public opinion only to be for the media of the party. This is another effective propaganda. One could conceive of a state that would suppress all pardons and live by itself, that was across a pattern of dictatorship. However, that is no longer possible. Once public opinion has been aroused and the verdict political problems, it must be taken into consideration. The propaganda mechanism of the state cannot function as an administrative unit It cannot have reality or efficiency except through the media of the state party. It is impossible to imagine that a modern state could command except without working through a party establishing contact between those who govern and public opinion. The party Sunday had a role to submit propaganda for the government. That is propaganda that the government wishes to be made. In one sense, incidentally, we find here the image of a park in its purest state. For ultimate the every party is a propaganda machine. But this is much more hidden in other systems in which there are still some nuances of the And the dictatorship's department no longer serves any ideological or political function. No longer expresses social interest, and so on. Is an organ designed to contain and train public opinion. And exists solely because of the state's need. As soon as that need diminishes, the role and prestige of the party also diminish. This happened in Nazi Germany in 1938. Footnotes. After the concentration of all powers in your fewer's hands, Under the Soviet Union, after the purges of 1936, But as soon as propaganda again becomes important, the party resumes its role. Propaganda very clearly gives direction to the life of political parties. Imposes certain forms and rules on them, sends them down certain paths, and ends up by deciding their life for death until the regime expands to the point they reach propaganda and pardon are totally free. I was not trying to say that propaganda is the only factor in the evolution of parties. It certainly combines with other elements of which one can say. However, that they either are of less importance than propaganda or are tied in with it. With it. The effects on the world of labor. We now come face to face with one of the modern world's most critical problems. We were in agreement. That is the condition of the worker. Created by technological developments used in the beginning by capitalism, and used now by socialization. Socialism has claimed that the workers' condition was the food of capitalism and that the exploitation of workers by finance capital. This does, to some extent, explain both the depressed condition of the worker and the But it is not the major factor. Labor conditions result in the relation between man and machine. And they're a consequence of technological developments taken into broad sense. Urbanization, massification, streamlining, the disappearance of the notion of work, mechanization, and so on. All beings are much more responsible for labor conditions than at the means of production are part of the own. This last fact is the polarization according to Marxist theory. The polarization is only one aspect. Once socialism has taken the means of production out of private hands, politically speaking, the working class and, frankly speaking, is no longer the proletariat. But it remains in the grip of the same country. Undoubtedly, the problem of poverty can be solved. But nothing indicates that it can be more easily solved under socialism than undercapital Few workers except farmers the United States, live in poverty. But one cannot say that the labor problem has been solved even there. If we look at the situation of labor in socialist countries, we see that the workers still insubordinate to the machine. That he has little personal life. That he is involved in the mass, and that he is prayed to the problems connected with the artificially mentioned days more than, potentially, from his work, false culture, ignorance of environment, divorce from nature, artificial life, and so on. But we also see that the problem of profits is not being solved. And that the worker still is not properly paid. The only difference is that the profit is known by the state. And denied by private individual. In addition, we see that in socialist countries, most local legislation Those advanced as in capitalist countries from the point of view of security, family allocations, vacations, and all sorts of financial rewards Has we progressed with regard to universal? There are to strike in work discipline. We see finally that the worker in no way by participates fundamentally in the life of his factory. In socialist countries, the works council may make suggestions only with regard to secondary question. With regard to principal questions, he merely ratifies the decisions of a 5 year Furthermore, collective ownership of the means of is pure fiction. The workers own nothing, and though it was regarded as machines, in the same situation as workers under capitalism. Whether it be the state or the entire collective. Which must necessarily be represented by some organization, The proprietor has nothing to do with the workers in the factory. This notion of collective ownership corresponds on the economic plane. To the old idea of the sovereign people, the political plane, We know how much harm better idea that fiction, that obstruction has done the thing of the scene in the power of the people. I cannot perceive this point here, but I can assert that the situation of labor has not really changed as a result of social Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the attitude of the workers is different. Except in rare cases, the working class has given the support to the regimes and communist countries. There is no longer a claims in opposition but is really in accord with the regime. And the concrete situation seems to be that there no longer is an antidote of rebellion. The workers put their hearts in their work. Abandon themselves to their work. No longer wish to engage and slow down. This is so no matter how much the entire communist is denied. Something undoubtedly has changed. Regard to the labor situation in communist country. But the workers have not been integrated by force, What has changed First of all, is the social climate. The worker is no longer excluded from society. The feeling of being excluded from society is felt society. He was a pariah and outsider. The society of a certain criteria and have so certain basic structures that the worker is not included in. The problem of private property is only a symbol of that exclusion. Which in turn produces the proletariat. But in socialist society, the worker is at the center of a world that is being built. She is in an honored position. The society is a noble This is said constantly. Is demonstrated in various cultural, political, and economic ways. This climate has changed the worker's reaction. He is now convinced that he's important. He is also convinced that society is not against him, but for him. In this society, this is a chamber, and that he is being run to go

[00:00:09] Speaker 2: Boy, do I have a lot to say about this discussion. So Chris Cuomo of NewsNation had on Jamie Peck a lively discussion about for profit health care and Luigi Mangione. Now Peck is a self described communist and host of the Party Girls podcast, also formerly of the majority report. And is introduced here on NewsNation as a spokesperson for the Luigi Mangione Defense Fund. Speaking of this, fundraising that is going on, Now I wanna be clear. It's not clear to me whether or not Jamie actually set this up whoever set up is is anonymous. She is speaking on behalf of them. Here, and they have raised over a 150 $1,000 the goal is $500,000. To be clear, they go on to write as well. This is a preemptive legal fundraiser for the suspect allegedly involved in the murder of the UnitedHealthcare CEO. We are not here to celebrate violence, but we do believe in the constitutional right of fair  [00:01:05] User: legal representation.  [00:01:06] Speaker 2: Not clear whether or not this was set up before it was known that Luigi Mangione can clearly pay for his own lawyer, so, again, it's not clear to me where the money is actually going to go. I don't think they're it sounds like they're not going to accept from what I'm what I'm reading, but regardless, I wanna get to the first clip here and I just got a lot to say about what this what this means In terms of the discourse around What? Is going on right now in terms of health care, but also the discourse around what the left actually is. Help me understand. Why is it a beautiful thing?  [00:01:38] Speaker 3: Why do you support him assassinating another human being in cold blood?  [00:01:42] Speaker 1: So I was definitely joking a little bit, obviously, trying to compare between what Donald Trump said about himself and, The sort of explosion, this appetite, this excitement for the conversation Luigi Mangione Started but I do think to call this an act of terrorism is an insult to the intelligence of the American people. Terrorism is something designed to strike fear into the hearts of noncombatants civilians. Right? The general population. Nobody but a tiny class of CEOs has been made to live in fear by Luigi's actions, but nearly everybody knows what it's like to live in fear having a necessary medical claim denied. The fear of having your life ruined, or potentially ended by a stack of medical bills. And I think in a system with so much violence that's direct from the top down, it should come as no surprise when violence begins to boomerang back from the bottom up onto the 1%. Also, I would like to remind you on the subject of terrorism, nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives on 9/11. Right? This is the largest terrorist attack this country has ever seen. An estimated 190,000 people are murdered each year by our broken health care system. That is the equivalent of 52 9/11s worth of deaths every year. Every single I did. Another 9/11. Okay. So I gotta ask, who is the pro the more prolific terrorist in this equation?  [00:03:09] Speaker 2: Alright. I'm gonna get to Chris' response, but this  [00:03:12] Speaker 1: won't  [00:03:13] Speaker 2: get to anything, even Jamie's points here. I wanna just discuss what something like this means. Having this conversation on a television program. What this means generally? So first, credit to Jamie for being willing to go on and face special, you know, blowback online for making this appearance. To Chris Cuomo for inviting her on. This is where we get to how important conversations like this are. Even if you think Jamie goes too far in, you know, advocating for this legal defense fund, This this conversation is beneficial to a media discourse. People for a long time now have this idea that the left is about, you know, woke scolding, and it's about  [00:03:51] Speaker 0: Forever.  [00:03:52] Speaker 1: There has been this domination of politics of capitalist politics has been the dominating discourse in mainstream press for the obvious reason that these are run by capitalist organizations. So there's going to be a certain slant when it comes to simply the hiring process And How often do you see a communist invited onto a news network? I can't even think of another example. Maybe at some point it's happened over the past decade or so. I I haven't seen I haven't seen  [00:04:18] Speaker 2: beneficial to just having to poll or the the the need to poll the conversation back towards a place That is a little more sane. That isn't to say, you know, there are people that are gonna be like, oh, but isn't this just gonna turn people off to the left seeing, someone like Jamie here? You know, advocating or, raising money for Luigi Mangione. But ask yourself, has that hurt Trump? Think of all the focus on Trump and Trump's cult and far right as that hurt him, as that hurt the Republican Party, Clearly, it hasn't. What's ended up happening is by dominating the news cycle, you have people conditioned to thinking in terms of right wing framing. Even if I don't agree with Trump and far right politics, whatever is a little more to the left of that mainstream conservative politics appears to them to be a little more sane because, oh, well, at least not the crazy Trump cult. But when you have someone like Jamie on, and more people like this, you know, more communist socialist in a mainstream discussion, it helps to pull discourse back towards the actual center. As right now, all of political discourse is just Branched. In far right, in capitalist politics. And the anger at for profit health care is real. Anger at how much wealth is concentrated at the top in the hands of a few is real. And getting people to know that broadly that's what the left is angry about I think, is a positive thing. Now before I get to the next clip here on what James was discussing, I mean, there's I think there's no doubt that what Luigi Mangione did allegedly did. Is a violent and illegal act. But what for profit health insurance does by putting people in situations where they're denied claims is also a violent act. But it's a legally violent act. I think that's the clear distinction there. One act, both acts are violent, but one is illegal, And I think Jamie here is Trying to highlight that How insane it is. That we just all accept that Americans accept that for private health care is normal as perfectly  [00:06:14] Speaker 1: normal  [00:06:15] Speaker 2: for people to be denied healthcare in a time when that should not  [00:06:19] Speaker 1: So  [00:06:20] Speaker 2: it isn't just Jamie who's questioning, by the way, the the terrorism charge. Here's a quick clip from, MSNBC. Also, Questioning. Charge for terrorism.  [00:06:27] Speaker 3: Just questioning the terrorism charge because I I start to worry that you get into a slippery slope by by charging by using the terrorism charge, potentially using it in this way. And I'm I'm maybe I'm wrong, but I just mean that that piqued my interest.  [00:06:38] Speaker 4: And I'd be very it piques my interest too, particularly you and I were discussing during the press conference that not only is it a slippery slope with respect to the use of terrorism charge, but the very use of certain evidence in this case is itself reflective to some of the existence of a police state for kids  [00:06:53] Speaker 3: so much surveillance.  [00:06:54] Speaker 4: Electronic surveillance that been involved here is itself something that concerns many civil libertarians. Yeah. And so you're right to say that this is a concern, and I'll be very curious to see how they attempt to persuade a jury, particularly a Manhattan jury, where Eugene Mangione may have taken on full hero status already that he intended this act not only to kill Brian Thompson himself, but to intimidate others in the course of conduct.  [00:07:19] Speaker 2: Katie Turr and her guests there also openly questioning the, application of the terrorism charge in this case. But, Chris Cuomo has a bit of a different perspective. So here's here because we Jamie's response at the beginning, as well as Cuomo has something at the end here. That, I take a little issue with. Well, first of all, as you may know, Jamie, terrorism  [00:07:38] Speaker 5: is a specific legal standard. Right? There's no question that Luigi did what he did in furtherance of a political agenda. He said it Okay? So I don't see this as a question of factor law. It's about the policy behind What I don't understand and you know, you are somebody who in your positions is constantly trying to embrace the humanity of situations. Right? I've been looking at why you support what you do with what's happening in the Middle East conflict. To me, this seems to be anathema to this. You know nothing within a system gets changed by violence.  [00:08:10] Speaker 2: Alright. The French revolution. The Boston Tea Party, the American Revolutionary War, Stonewall riots, All violent acts that led to big changes. Now you can both condemn and discourage violent acts, and I do, while also understanding the role That violence has played in history against oppressors.  [00:08:29] Speaker 5: And that's  [00:08:30] Speaker 2: it's always been a reaction to what is already happening to a group of people. You know, it doesn't come out of nowhere. There there was historical context or why people act out when they feel like they are being oppressed or that they represent are being oppressed, he also attempts there to call Jamie a hypocrite by analogizing Jamie's condemnation of Israel's mass atrocities against Palestinians. To what her reaction should be to Luigi Mangione, which I find to be bizarre. Because  [00:09:02] Speaker 4: Jamie's support for  [00:09:03] Speaker 2: Palestinian human rights is born out  [00:09:05] Speaker 1: of  [00:09:06] Speaker 2: the oppression of Palestinians at the hand of the Israeli government. Which is why and others are using this moment to speak on the oppression that normal people are facing under a for profit health care system. So I don't think Jamie's being a hypocrite here. I think she's being consistent. But Chris Cuomo is pulling the whole element of power and who was oppressed, who who the oppressor out of this equation, which doesn't make any sense in the context of what the discussions actually are? Let me get now to the last clip.  [00:09:34] Speaker 5: I want you to understand that I don't think that the energy that you're putting towards backing this guy is getting us to a better place with the problems of the  [00:09:41] Speaker 1: system.  [00:09:42] Speaker 5: That's my point to you. Use the money you raised for the people who need it. Not this guy.  [00:09:46] Speaker 3: Well, I believe we really need to treat the causes of problems, rather than merely the symptoms. And I think if you wanna know what kinds of tactics I do advocate for, I think we need a mass movement. You know? Change comes from the bottom up, but not a bottle the way  [00:10:05] Speaker 5: down.  [00:10:06] Speaker 3: And I'm talking about  [00:10:07] User: mass resist  [00:10:09] Speaker 4: to  [00:10:10] Speaker 3: medical debt. If everybody  [00:10:12] Speaker 4: burns their medical bills,  [00:10:13] Speaker 3: in front of the health insurance offices  [00:10:16] Speaker 5: on Mac. Staffer.  [00:10:17] Speaker 3: That's gonna create change. And we're just trying to figure out how to  [00:10:21] Speaker 6: use this moment this moment of excite of popular excitement has been touched off by, yes, a violent act that I would not advocate for as a tactic, if it were up to the money. But it happened. We're trying to figure out how to ride that wave and move this conversation forward into mass action that can really make a difference.  [00:10:38] Speaker 5: Well, listen. I'm here for  [00:10:40] Speaker 1: it.  [00:10:41] Speaker 5: I always have been, but we're covering it. I would love for that to be the the discussion. But as long as this guy is glamorized, it is a distraction.  [00:10:48] Speaker 2: Alright. Jamie has already succeeded. Because in that clip, you see Chris Cuomo appears to be open to the idea of mass resistance to medical debt. Of burning your medical bills, not paying them off on a mass scale, This is something that I feel like he would not be so open to if the discussion didn't start from why are you raising money for this alleged assassin, But because that's where the conversation began, all of a sudden, when you bring things a little more to you know, to, the center of that, then it appears more reasonable. This is why these sorts of discussions are so important. Having people like having communist socialist on news networks are so important. Because it helps to move the conversation. So great job here from Jamie. And again, credit to Chris Cuomo for having willing to have an honest conversation here. You know, he has a disagreement, and he's voicing it, but he's doing it in the way where he's shouting her down or not hearing her out. He's willing to let her talk. You know, he's allowing her to speak and and make her points.

Detailed Transcript:  [00:00:00] Speaker 1: because you incited them, that's the talking point. See? The truth is, though, this is only a fraction of what's happening. Health care is only one aspect. What you have to understand is that getting away with unethical behavior directly correlates to how many people you affect. Wrong one person, and you might get away with it. Sure. But those guys who killed my brother-in-law, wronged 1,000,000 and you have a much bigger problem to navigate. When somebody wrongs you, There's a visceral feeling of violation. If someone points a gun in your face and takes your wallet, it's a feeling that stays with you for the rest of your life. Coming home and finding that your house has been broken into is a grotesque feeling. Some stranger coming into your life and taking something from you, something that you worked for, can feel like a partial death. And in a way, it is. How many hours, days, or even years of work did it take to purchase that which was stolen from you? In a way, all that time you worked was stolen too. And time is the only thing you truly have in this world. People only tolerate that up until a certain point. And after that point, they become ready, willing, and able to fight for what they have.  [00:01:12] Speaker 0: Video called.  [00:01:14] Speaker 1: weaponizing young men with fear, I talk about how people have poor risk assessment abilities, how they will irrational irrationally fear things far less likely to happen. Than things far more likely to happen. That applies here as well. In the United States, every year, around $53,000,000,000 is stolen from people.  [00:01:38] Speaker 0: Robberies.  [00:01:40] Speaker 1: only account for 0.34% of $1,000,000,000 in means robberies only account for 0.64%. Of what is stolen from Americans per year, That's what you see on the news and on Twitter and what politicians use to sell themselves as the solution for rampant crime. So who on earth is stealing the other 99%? Well, $39.2 billion of the $52,000,000,000 is what companies steal from their employees. Per year. That's 74%. 74% of the theft in the United States per year. Is companies stealing from their employees? That's minimum wage violations, overtime violations.  [00:02:18] Speaker 0: Nonetheless. Imagine.  [00:02:20] Speaker 1: 20 of those violent summers every year. Not in commercial districts, but in neighborhoods. That's the material cost affecting us. It does not happen with a crowbar or a molotov. It happens. With a pen. You know what's even more infuriating? That $40,000,000,000 is pennies. Pennies compared to what else.  [00:02:44] Speaker 0: is.  [00:02:45] Speaker 1: stolen from you. But it's not included in the statistics because technically, it cannot be classified.  [00:02:50] Speaker 0: Political campaign. And it could be dark money, meaning that they didn't have to report it. This is, of course, how your government is bought. Incidentally, insurance company packs donated $23,000,000,000 to candidates in 2024. What's interesting is that before this decision was made, It was at.  [00:03:09] Speaker 0: Skyrocketed and just enough money was given to Democrats to make them ineffective. They started giving a hell of a lot of money away. So what were they getting in return? $100 of $1,000,000,000 in subsidies. Their investment paid off quite well for them. Not only do they make record profits, but they get tons of your tax dollars because the corporations and the government are working together like the mob. If you don't play ball, then they fund your political opponent and get them in our slip.  [00:03:41] Speaker 1: and in return, they deregulate and send you tons of subsidies that result in a market advantage that is about as far as you can get from free market capitalism as you could possibly imagine. Yet they want you to believe that anyone who has hardcore communist, un-American, or anti-business. It's ridiculous red scare tactics. Get the regular people to fight among themselves. Cause people to complain about the inner city mother of 5 getting food stamps and money for rent which causes people to call her a welfare queen while billions of your tax dollars are being siphoned off to the robber barons that are literally destroying your children's futures. And just like the pedo who cries pedo, they also cry about the dangers of wealth redistribution. Redistribution while conducting the most massive wealth redistribution that has ever occurred complete with too big to fail bailouts, which are more aptly described as handouts. Privatize the profits, socialize the losses. This is reverse Robinhood on a massive scale. But cheap energy is good. Right? It helps everyone, doesn't it? We need oil, don't we? It's included in so many products. Look. The only reason we supposedly need as much oil as we do. Is because our society was built around needing the oil industry. We built an incredibly inefficient society around cars rather than people. So we need to commute everywhere. Wasting billions of dollars and years of our lives. Because of the world that was built for us to inhabit. A concrete world of planned obsolescence, deliberate inefficiencies, and complete reliance on those who made it this way. It's like giving your doctor a baseball bat and letting him beat the shit out of you so that you need him to keep you alive. That's what we're doing right now. It's lunacy. But this is the world in which we were raised. So it feels normal to us. In truth, it makes no sense for us. It makes perfect sense for them though. For the few It's an advanced form of widespread robbery. You are living in the midst of the empire that has ever existed. And you are being robbed every single day. Not by the poor, but by the wealthy. I'm not talking about people who aren't merely well off, not your rich uncle. Not your doctor. And not the small business owner who makes a good living. It's done by the people and companies with enough wealth to buy countries. The only reason it's not called criminal is because they paid off the people who make the laws. The criminals made it legal to do crime and you are the victim. You're the mark. You just don't know it. Because it wasn't done with a gun or a knife. It was done with the stroke of a pen. So it looks so civilized. What's the result of all this? Well, the result is a massive hoarding of wealth. 80 percent of our country, 80 percent. S 7 percent of the wealth The top 10% have 70 percent of the wealth much of that being concentrated in the top 1%. That's not the result of a meritocracy. That's not a fair and free market at work. That is the result.  [00:07:00] Speaker 0: $1,000. If every single one of them had a $1,000 emergency expense right it would amount to $200,000,000,000 which is less than half of what Elon Musk alone has. But didn't he make money from electric cars which are better in terms of climate change? Well, Musk made much of his money by selling carbon credits. So that other companies can pollute more. He essentially turned Tesla into a pollution company.  [00:07:34] Speaker 1: bottom line is that our entire country is a store that's being looted and it's almost empty. We got 7% left. And they're not going to leave that on the table either. That's not the nature of greed. Cancer is not rational. If it were, then it wouldn't kill you. It would grow just enough so that you could keep living. And thus the cancer could keep living too. But that's not how cancer works. And greed is like cancer. They will just keep taking and taking until it kills our society. I could show you some graphs like the ones in this older video. Here's that ideal we asked everyone about. Something like this curve.  [00:08:10] Speaker 2: This isn't too bad. We've got some incentive as the wealthiest folks are now about...  [00:08:16] Speaker 0: Middle class is certainly struggling more than they were while the rich and wealthy are making roughly a 100 times that of the poorest Americans, and about 10 times that of the still healthy middle class.

**Title:** Discussion on Violence, Ethics, and Health Care

**Overview:** The conversation delves into the ethics of violence and the societal factors that lead to its acceptance. It references historical and current events, such as World War II and school shootings in the United States, to discuss how violence is sometimes seen as a necessary evil. The speakers reflect on the moral complexities surrounding violence and its justification, emphasizing that peaceful solutions should be exhausted first. The discussion then shifts to the role of large corporations, particularly health insurance companies, in perpetuating systemic issues that affect millions. The conversation critiques the profit-driven motives of these corporations and their impact on society, exemplified by the public reaction to the death of a UnitedHealthcare CEO, which was met with indifference or even approval due to the perceived harm caused by his company.

Alright. So let's see what this was. Is it cutie talking, Hassan on the naughty or nice shit? List. It  [00:00:10] Speaker 1: does smell bad.  [00:00:11] Speaker 0: When I was a little kid, sometimes my grandfather would talk about World War 2. He said everyone was so happy when Germany finally started getting  [00:00:22] Speaker 1: doing to and to so many others, I always saw my grandfather as such a good and honest man. A man of Great. Integrity. A piece Loving man, yet he was happy. About such widespread violence, indiscriminately blanketing an entire populace with fire. And fury. But consider the context of his time, Consider what the Nazis had done up until then, what they put people through and the only tools we had to stop it. When faced with great injustice, even the best will turn to violence Even the best of us will be glad for violence. That's what I don't want it to come to. You should do everything in your power to avoid the in which violence becomes necessary. Because only then, only when all peaceful avenues have been exhausted Can violence be justified? And that's a hell of a thing because violence is ugly. We have a natural revulsion to it. It takes a lot of Anger,  [00:01:14] Speaker 0: Can be cloaked by a labyrinth of bureaucracy. But that only works for so long before people start to understand who is really affecting their lives and why. Propaganda has limits and can only material reality up into a certain point. You can't rely on that forever. At a societal level, those with the real responsibility to avoid avoid violence lie not with the people with the powerful. Those with power can freely choose  [00:01:37] Speaker 1: the results are quite different. You have the power to take it all. But the world that would result from that is not a world  [00:01:46] User: you  [00:01:47] Speaker 1: would wanna live in. During the full 100 years of 20th century, there were 360 school shootings in the United States, We are still in the Q1 of the 21st century in yet so far in the 21st century, there have been 5 and 75 school shootings already far more than the entirety of the 20th century. Now some of these school shooters were inspired by each other and copied each other. Yet they were all universally hated Everyone was disgusted by what they did. They were seen as monsters. Soon it became anathema to even speak their names They terrified regular people, people like myself, as I have a Even if I didn't, though, I would still be horrified by it. Everybody knows that children don't deserve to be killed. Well, most of us know that. Yet despite how hated Those killers were. It kept happening. And now it happens more than ever before. So here's a hypothetical for you. If it can become a trend to commit an act of violence, that makes you hated, Can it become a trend to commit an act of violence that makes you beloved? It seems to me like that's at least possible if not likely. And I say that without moral judgment of my own. I'm not advocating it. I'm the examining it. It's the for consideration. There are around 20, 1,000 murders per year. The United States. Of course, you don't hear about the vast majority of them. People like my brother-in-law who fought back against a couple of muggers and was shot ahead for it. I believe they got away with about 20 dollars. There was a single paragraph about it, and did not seem to care all that much. To them, it was boring. Routine. It was as if they already knew the killers would never become but it's a very different story when someone of note. What I saw among the general public recently after the shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO Was quite unprecedented. The media tried to condemn it, and some tried to twist it into partisan politics, but that did not seem to work. Neither right nor left mattered. People were united across the borders spectrum, which is a neutral, but as that devious spectrum itself exists to divide us and to keep us fighting amongst ourselves rather than for our own self interests. It's exceedingly proficient at pitting us against each other. But for a moment, out of the countless shootings in this country, there was actually one that most of the public at the very least, did not mind. Regardless of political affiliation. It was a unification of sentiment I had not seen since the killing of Osama bin Laden and he was guilty of an act of terrorism that 3,000 lives. What if your death had a similar reaction? That's a hell of a thing, isn't it? Imagine millions of people either celebrating your death or at the very least not minding it. It's a scary thought. I would imagine that it's at least disconcerting for the peers of that CEO, especially as they try to live in a society that cheers on his pillar. A society that is more heavily armed than ever before. I fear that his peers will take away the exact wrong message which will be the status quo plus more security. To the peers of that scene, I don't want to see you be killed. I don't even want there to be a death penalty.  [00:05:20] Speaker 0: Brian Thompson was a wouldn't know. But what they do know what the company he worked for does, and that's all they need to know. So it's not even about personal hatred. That CEO could have been anybody. It was what he represented that matter. Was what he agreed to do in his profession. That angered every day regular people When your chosen profession affects the lives of millions of people,  [00:05:44] Speaker 1: But what if your profession itself makes ethical behavior impossible? Well, then nobody should be doing it in the first place. And the mere act of doing it becomes an indictment. What if more people died because of you than because of Bin Laden? Not because of any sort of ideological hatred, not because of explicit, highly visible violence like flying planes into buildings, but merely because it's part of doing business. A stroke of the pen. It's so much more civil Isn't it? It allows you to pretend that you have the moral high ground We have the ability to save your life. But somebody else's pen said no. We have the ability to stop No. It may seem ridiculous to compare that to Nazis and jihadists, but the only real difference is in their reasons. They're all overseers of pain. Suffering and death. Some do it because of hatred, while others do it for profit. It's nothing personal to them. But, of course, to you, it's the most personality it can be. It your fight. In the end, though, no matter how someone dies, the fact that they died curious 10 days after the UnitedHealthcare CEO was killed, So The billionaire founder of the Mango Fashion Company died in a hiking accident. Be described as sad. What's going on here? Did these commenters know that man? Did they wake up feeling wronged by that man? Did they even know his name before that day? Probably not. What he did do however, was accumulate 1,000,000,000 of dollars during a time when many of us are struggling. That's with those who did not care about his death. Understood. Now some people will mistake that for envy. But that's far too simplistic. It's okay to be rich and successful, but the degree and the content Text. Matters. If a lion was gorging himself on a buffalo carcass, and swatted away the other members of his pride. That would not be an accurate analogy to describe what's currently going on in our society to accurate describe it. The pride would have to be on the brink of starvation and the greedy lion would have to be hoarding 1,000 of buffalo carcasses, more than he could ever eat and swatting the pride away from all of those carcasses nonetheless. And if the pride should kill their own buffalo, then the lion would take it. And add it to his forbidden mountain of carcassins. We would immediately recognize the absurdity of such a lion. We would not try to defend it as an ambition or admirable in any way. It's only partially about health care, you see. That's what others need to understand. I'll get into that shortly. But as far as health care goes, for the longest time, we were made to believe bad and expensive health care with insured company battles. Was just a part of reality. And that it was unrealistic to expect otherwise. It was fantasy to live in a world where you could receive quality health care and not be charged a lot of money for it. But then the Internet happened, and the world got a lot smaller. A lot more connected. And we started hearing about how other countries have free health care. So then they started arguing that it's not exactly free because they have to pay for it in their taxes. But as it turns out, it would be less expensive to pay for it through your taxes than through a below greedy middleman that can base your medical care on their profits. It's fully understood that a person with limited means can easily be discouraged from and even incapable of legally challenging a massive corporation, especially while going through serious medical issues After all, such corporations are bigger than any of us. They're quasi governments. Even though they're not alive, they're classified as people. But everyone understands that's a legal fiction. To protect the people behind them. Some of you watching this video make around $30,000 a year or less. The CEO of UnitedHealthcare made 30,000 dollars a day. His job was to determine the best possible ways to choose money over stopping pain, suffering, and death. For that, he made $30,000 a day. He did not die while attending a patient's meeting He died while attending an investor meeting. Those close to him defended him by claiming that indeed there are problems with the way we do health insurance. In this country but that's not his fault. They say. It's the systems Nobody forced him to do that job, though. And nobody forced that particular company to be the very worst offender of the system. You can't be the very best at profit. Profiting off the system and then claim to wish the system were different. That's an obvious lie. And if the very people in charge of this system can't be blamed, then who can be? They're the reason health care is so expensive and first place. The CEO of the parent company of UnitedHealthcare's said that he's super proud to be part of an organization that does so much good for so many. Every one of us regular people recognizes that as PR bullshit. It couldn't be further from the truth. He also said this, And we make sure that care is safe, appropriate,  [00:12:05] Speaker 2: and is delivered when people need it. And we go against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex. Ultimately unsustainable. So we're gonna continue to make that case. We will continue to do the work we do I encourage you to tune out that critical noise that we're hearing right now. And what we know to be true Is needs a company like UnitedHealth Group and it needs people like Brian within it,  [00:12:35] Speaker 1: Now consider the context of that quote. First of all, insurance companies have no business making medical decisions. To decide what's necessary And second of all, UnitedHealth Group makes record profits every single year. While Americans struggle More and more. Every single year I don't wanna hear about his version of unsustainability. What he really means is that the level of profit margin that they currently enjoy would be unsustainable. So people are going to have to be sacrificed on that altar. The altar of sustained high profits. That's what he really means. And the news media flooded us with puff pieces about how wonderful this other CEO, Brian Thompson, was and how the positive reaction to his death was appalling but was only a fringe few That's a lie. It wasn't a fringe view. They're desperately trying to craft a narrative right now, one that paints Regular people as monsters. Though I would not celebrate his death or anyone else's death, I don't really blame people who do. They've been through worse than I have. You can't expect them to be emotionless robots emotionless, like the people who seal their fates with the stroke of a pen. That may look civil it's anything but. In this CBS piece, it says that at an investor meeting last year, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare a value based care. To keep patients healthy rather than focusing on treating them when they get sick. CEOs love lying to investors. I'm fully covered under UnitedHealthcare. This year, after I got flu shots for my whole family, you know what else I got?  [00:14:05] Speaker 0: That's just abhorrent. And not an American. They're ambitious. Business professionals, you see. So watch your loved one wither away along with the rest of your life saved And for goodness sake, don't be so crass as to show a lack of concern when misfortune falls upon those in charge of that system. How dare you? That's what they're really telling you. Take it and be polite about it.

Like, I fucking want to fucking be a better person when I was  [00:03:03] Speaker 2: the I don't  [00:03:05] Speaker 3: Actually, because  [00:03:06] Speaker 1: I fucking feel so deeply for you, fucking feel so deeply for you. That's the only reason why your words can affect me like they fucking do. Because I fucking care so much what you have to say, what you think, I fucking do. If I didn't fucking care, I didn't fucking love you, I wouldn't fucking be here. Wouldn't be fucking trying have a conversation with you, trying reach some sort of fucking peace. Like, it would  [00:03:30] User: We would be at peace. Okay? If you just I don't know why you're trying to be with me so badly without wanting anything to change.

[00:06:06] User: Then stop  [00:06:07] Speaker 2: doing that.  [00:06:08] Speaker 1: I'm  [00:06:09] User: telling you what you do normally k. Do  [00:06:11] Speaker 2: is the problem. This is their problem.  [00:06:12] User: If we have any kind of argument or something's weird, whatever it is you don't understand,  [00:06:16] Speaker 4: You don't  [00:06:17] User: come you don't seek to understand. You just wanna stop fighting and it's just like a thing where If something is, like, Is something is out of place where you do something and I pointed out like yesterday when you putting the fuses and something, and I just said, give me those or whatever I said. Like, don't put those in there. I mean, I said what I said it in the way I did because They didn't go there and I mean whether or not you knew or not either way that was not where they went. That's not where I wanted them. Whatever it was. It doesn't matter, like, I wasn't rude to you, but the fact that, like, You had an explanation for doing it as a means for me being, like, unjustifiably, like,  [00:06:46] Speaker 2: I don't even know. I mean, it wasn't even a big deal whatsoever. Like, why you even  [00:06:49] User: had to say anything at all? Were just, like, blew my mind as to how it became a thing of, like,  [00:06:53] Speaker 2: that even that big of something you'd be mad about? You're right. I wasn't mad about it, but now you're telling me that I  [00:06:58] Speaker 4: had, like, you telling me that me is I mean, I don't even know. What do I what should I have said? Anyways, Like you put them in there, I don't like I was putting them somewhere else whatever. You know I was sat here and I was I did all of that for you. I mean, literally all you had to do is just be like, oops whatever. I don't know. So it's just nothing. You didn't have to say anything at all. I wasn't mad at you at all. I didn't, like, wasn't blaming you. It wasn't anything. But the fact that you explained, well, there's already so many here. What did I whatever. Like, I mean, I don't know, like, why Like, what the like, because the bottom line is you did do something that I didn't want you to do. And they didn't go there. You kinda messed up whatever the whatever. It  [00:07:34] Speaker 2: wasn't even big deal. It was just that  [00:07:36] Speaker 4: well, I mean, will you even own that you put something in the wrong place? Even not even knowing? It's like like not knowing? Is that okay even? Like, is that something you can handle? Like, me telling you, like, hey. I'm putting these over here already. I already have a spot for those. Is that okay for me to say? Like, there's nothing wrong. You didn't do anything wrong whatsoever. At all. Like, but I Me in the, like, moment, you know I just did all that for you. You know I did all of that for you. So me in the moment, just having this like these over here, whatever, like I mean, there's nothing that, like, to  [00:08:06] even  [00:08:07] Speaker 4: like, I was not mad at all. There was nothing I wasn't mad about it. I mean, I made a, like, my tone of voice was like, oh, he's over here kind of thing, but that was because I mean, it wasn't anything serious at all. Like, there's nothing like I  [00:08:17] Speaker 2: made  [00:08:18] Speaker 4: I don't know how I would have asked you, like, considering the fact that, like, I did do all that for you, and I don't know.  [00:08:23] User: Don't know. Either way,  [00:08:24] Speaker 4: But the point  [00:08:25] Speaker 1: was  [00:08:26] Speaker 4: that We got that turned into a bigger fight because I said that you said or because you made it, like I was being unreasonable or I was overreacting. That's what I said.  [00:08:34] Speaker 2: Even  [00:08:35] Speaker 3: though  [00:08:36] Speaker 4: you didn't say those words, what we were fighting about was because I said that you made it seem like I was overreacting, telling me I'm overreacting to something. Again, which you always do. Anytime you say, it's not the big of a deal, you're getting mad about nothing, doesn't matter if I'm mad. I don't care about the fucking semantics of the word you use. It is the fact that my emotion, whatever it is, is to you too much because whatever it is, it doesn't matter. Okay? Care if you ever said those words. That is not the point. When you do that, you're literally dismissing what I'm saying. You're dismissing the whole, like, I don't care what word you're using. I'm  [00:09:10] Speaker 2: not gonna argue with you and say I'm not mad even if I'm not mad.  [00:09:12] Speaker 4: It is the fact that you're saying that any emotion I feel I'm not saying, I do have a right to be mad because most of them, I'm not mad about it. It at all, but you just acting like it's not a big deal at all because you don't wanna deal with whatever emotion I'm feeling or me saying that I, like that no. Don't do that. Like, the most simple thing. Like, no, no, do that or no, give me this or hey, I was doing this this way, like that the most simple thing, and you just being like, it's either like it's either response like you explain yourself or my bad as if, like, what the fuck? Like, it's  [00:09:40] Speaker 2: not that big of a deal. Like, why you always we're not against  [00:09:42] Speaker 4: other. No. No. Plea I mean, yes. You can. Wait. Please. Do not and do not explain yourself,  [00:09:47] User: please.  [00:09:48] Speaker 4: I want you to acknowledge how I feel in those moments and why why it puts us against each other? That's what I want you to like, to think about. I don't want you to explain why you do it. There's no reason why you do because it gets us into fights. So there's no good reason for doing it. I'm not doing anything wrong to you in that moment. I don't know how I tell you something as simple as I'm putting these over here, without it being a thing where like you're getting defensive about it.  [00:10:12] Speaker 2: But  [00:10:13] Speaker 4: that was one one instance of this happening. And then the same night last night was the thing I got mad about. I Was that I said something about the guy his comment in the beginning or whatever. And I was talking about, like, I don't know. I just said something and he said, well, I think he was being facetious and you were explaining whatever. And I explained to you that that's what I was talking about too, and so I reiterated what I had said to show you the connection between, like, I was talking about that too. We weren't talking about 2 different things. Like, or whatever. And you're like, instead of just being like, oh, okay. I get it now. Okay. Yeah. Didn't get it at first. Whatever. Or I wasn't listening. I don't know. Whatever. It was a thing of instead of it just being like that because we were in need talking about the  [00:10:43] Speaker 2: same part.  [00:10:44] Speaker 4: I was pointing that out. That's  [00:10:46] Speaker 2: it.  [00:10:47] Speaker 4: You said to me that you're, like, okay. And Like, Like that's fine. I already said like, instead of just saying that, you went into this whole, like, thing where, okay, mean, I get it. And, like, I get it. Why are you telling me? I'm,  [00:10:56] Speaker 3: like,  [00:10:57] Speaker 4: I'm telling you again because you said I was wrong about, like, the part you were talking about. You said I was wrong. Those were my words, not yours. Did it change the meaning of what I'm saying whatsoever? The point I'm trying to make? No. But you hyper focus on that.  [00:11:13] Speaker 2: So that is what we were fighting about. That was what I was pissed about was because  [00:11:17] Speaker 4: this whole thing where you're just acting like I'm getting mad about nothing when it's like, no, Brian, is literally because you get  [00:11:21] Speaker 2: defensive about the most simple thing  [00:11:23] Speaker 4: and you focus on this thing where like like it's it's like well, I didn't say those words. I mean, I didn't say those like, oh my god. No. You didn't, but it doesn't matter if you said those words. That's not the point I'm making. You did say I was wrong by saying that we weren't talking about the same part. That I misunderstood you. That's saying I'm wrong, but you said you twist yourself in like this knot trying to explain yourself a way,  [00:11:47] Speaker 3: like explain  [00:11:48] Speaker 4: or not explain because then you at the point where you have nothing else to say. But, yeah, it's the same thing as saying you're wrong, basically. You're not wrong for saying  [00:12:00] Speaker 2: that. Look,  [00:12:01] Speaker 4: anything you will not say that, you will get a Jesus fucking Christ. And then that's it. That's it. Like, you cannot, like, why it gets to that just from, like, but you know you tied yourself in this knot. I'm not trying to do this to you. I don't want you to be defensive. I don't want you to think I'm attacking you. I'm not.  [00:12:19] Speaker 0: Recently because I'm just I'm over it. I shouldn't do it, and I'm sorry.  [00:12:24] Speaker 0: I'm cutting you off because you just you do everything but answer my question that will Like, This is your first message to me. This morning. You can come out now. I'm not gonna keep you locked up in your room. And then you follow it up with something sweet are some cigs in the chair.  [00:12:43] Speaker 1: Now it was gone. I I acknowledge that we were fucking in bad places this morning. I acknowledge that fucking it's my fault. I But you were feeling fucking upset, sad, like, giving up and all that shit. That's my fucking fault. And I'm fucking sorry for that. Truly, And when I sent that message, sorry. I'm gonna fucking explain myself. But I'm I'm explaining myself.

And fucking babe, I wanted I wanted to be fucking with you. I wanted to be close to you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I'm sorry that I did. Okay. Like,  [00:13:09] User: what I was feeling that I wanted you to do me? I don't  [00:13:12] Speaker 2: get it. I don't I don't understand why you always like to stop doing this. Disregard  [00:13:16] Speaker 1: it. I'm not disregarding feelings Please just I I know I don't know exactly what combination of all the feelings that you were feeling I know that fucking you were upset to say the very least. The most general fuck fucking word that I can that would cover anything that you were feeling. Sadness, fucking loneliness, fucking  [00:13:36] Speaker 2: I'm not gonna do some I'm don't do semantics. You could say whatever word you want. I'm not  [00:13:39] Speaker 1: I don't know what word to use. That's so that's why I use upset.  [00:13:42] Speaker 2: But I know that's a fucking blanket word. I don't care. I've never done that with I've never done Samantha. With you. You could say whatever emotion that's, like, not like, I mean, I don't I don't care. I don't you I get what you're saying. I understand. I was upset. Yes. I was upset.  [00:13:55] Speaker 1: I  [00:13:56] Speaker 2: was very  [00:13:57] Speaker 1: upset. And that being the case, I I knew that you weren't gonna, like, come out there come out in the living room, I don't know if you like, to do anything, to go paint fucking to go paint your book or anything, So In when I finally fucking said that, I I literally was trying to do you like a like a solid, like a favor. Like, because if I'm I've I felt it I that's what I was doing. I felt that I was keeping you locked in I I felt that I was keeping you locked in here because you were so upset and, like, I we weren't talking at the moment. And Hi, don't I I'll I'll I don't want you to feel prisoner in your own home.  [00:14:36] Speaker 2: Like, that's that's fucked up. About that then. I never  [00:14:39] Speaker 1: said that. I'm I'm I I was trying to empathize with you and fucking because like I said, like, you Am I am I am I wrong that you  [00:14:45] Speaker 3: would not have come out there while I was sitting there at the computer. Like  [00:14:48] Speaker 2: Brian, I wanted you to empathize with my feelings. On not being heard more so than I wanted you to fucking care about whether or not felt like I was trapped in my own home. You think that that's what I cared about feeling or caring about or even, like, think, like No. In that moment last  [00:15:03] Speaker 1: like  [00:15:04] Speaker 2: a doughnut. Stop. Okay. Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you understand what I'm saying right now? Yes. That you choosing to say  [00:15:10] Speaker 1: that  [00:15:11] Speaker 2: when I didn't say this, I've never made this a thing where because if I had I mean, what I did say that I cared about or that I wanted from you, was to acknowledge You not taking accountability. And for and then for sitting there straight of lying to me, and acting as if, like, you were trying to quit the you were trying to end the conversation because you acknowledged you acknowledged that we were talking with different parts, and you just wanted to move on. And it was me who wanted to keep fighting.  [00:15:36] Speaker 0: Like, I I it I know now that it was the fucking wrong thing. It was ash I  [00:15:40] Speaker 1: understand what you're saying. I understand what  [00:15:42] Speaker 0: you were saying. How how is me how is what I'm saying Why are you denying it now?  [00:15:46] Speaker 1: Why are you explaining it to me?

You should just be like, yeah. But I'm sorry. I didn't realize it. You understand now, then stop explaining yourself, Brian. You cannot explain yourself away. You can't explain this away. Okay? It won't make anything better. It just tells me that you think my feelings are invalid.

That had a this piece of wire, the silver wire that I cut. There was, like, 18 gauges. Came  [00:02:36] Speaker 2: in. Oh, you're cleaner. And weren't you looking for this forever?  [00:02:39] Speaker 1: I yes. I think. No. That's can you tell me about that?  [00:02:43] Speaker 2: No.  [00:02:44] Speaker 1: Okay.  [00:02:45] User: But, yes, I was looking for one  [00:02:47] Speaker 1: of them, but not not that one, but that is that one's a very good one too.  [00:02:50] Speaker 2: Cleaning, drying, non irritating, neutral pH. That was definitely not the one that I got. Yeah.  [00:02:55] Speaker 1: Okay.  [00:02:56] Speaker 2: Yeah.  [00:02:57] Speaker 1: Yeah. So don't  [00:02:58] Speaker 2: put  [00:02:59] Speaker 1: it back in there.  [00:03:01] User: I've seen it recently, and literally just saw it. But, yeah, I've seen it recently. I was looking for dog clear air cleaner. You're right. But, it's been a  [00:03:07] Speaker 1: long time since I've been looking for it. So and you've got some, and then I found another one even besides this one since then. So, yeah,  [00:03:13] Speaker 2: I  [00:03:14] Speaker 1: literally didn't know it was there, but I wouldn't have been  [00:03:17] Speaker 2: able  [00:03:18] Speaker 1: to tell you probably if, like, I don't know, whatever. I know it was something.  [00:03:23] User: Might need it.  [00:03:24] Speaker 1: What did you do? Just follow nothing?  [00:03:27] Speaker 2: Like, he was he was trying to, like, step over it.

[00:03:35] Speaker 1: So you guys get in, like, try to turn  [00:03:37] Speaker 2: around  [00:03:38] Speaker 1: while he was, like, still, like,  [00:03:40] Speaker 2: Mhmm. It's chill. It's okay. Mom is right there.  [00:03:43] Speaker 1: What happened?  [00:03:45] Speaker 2: So This onesie's fucking hot.  [00:03:47] Speaker 1: Better be for a $115.  [00:03:50] Speaker 2: Shit. Mhmm.  [00:03:51] Speaker 1: It's crazy. I don't know. I mean, I don't know what brand this is. Obviously, I don't think that any piece of clothing, like, especially something like that should be worth a $115, but whatever. It's not actually worth. It just depends on how people will pay for it, but but I have a feeling that that's, like, one of those things  [00:04:06] Speaker 2: I  [00:04:07] Speaker 1: don't know. I I really can't see any reasonable person spending that much money on that at all, but whatever. Feel like it's one of those things that Wait.  [00:04:14] Speaker 2: I  [00:04:15] Speaker 1: forgot what I was saying. I forgot what I was saying  [00:04:18] Speaker 2: because  [00:04:19] Speaker 1: I got confused by what I was doing. I feel like it's like some sort of thing that they have that's priced really high, but they don't actually charge for it. They really more so give it out for free for different, like, different, like, events. I don't know how to explain it but different promotional things that they're like, oh,  [00:04:37] Speaker 2: get the free  [00:04:38] Speaker 1: onesie that's priced at a $115. You're normally a $115 or something like that. But they just have it priced like that on the tags so people think that they're getting something of value. And it's free anyway, so why not? But I don't how the it depends, I guess, on how everything else is priced in there. And that's a good place. Seems pretty lame. I mean, there's nothing, like, spectacular about that fucking thing. I  [00:04:59] Speaker 2: mean, it's pretty. Pretty warm and soft and cozy.  [00:05:03] Speaker 1: Yeah. But it looks silly, and what the hell  [00:05:06] Speaker 2: It  [00:05:07] Speaker 1: looks silly like,  [00:05:09] Speaker 2: I miss  [00:05:10] Speaker 1: like, I'm okay with silly wouldn't be silly. It's okay for looking I don't like, looking silly is not the problem. Being paying a $115 to look silly is the problem. And then the the religious part of it or the  [00:05:23] User: The very,  [00:05:24] Speaker 1: very religious part of it. So  [00:05:26] Speaker 2: we drive it now?

Like, I I guess I don't understand what you're asking me. But not you don't have to be precise that precise honestly. It has a lot of, like, leeway or whatever.  [00:06:06] Speaker 2: That's what I that's what I was asking.  [00:06:08] Speaker 1: Yeah. I didn't know if I was doing something in particular that made you think that, like,  [00:06:12] Speaker 2: really  [00:06:13] Speaker 1: I'm not yeah. I'm not being that precise with it. I am No reason why it can't be, like, as precise with it, but not a big deal. Five bulbs. Your cell?  [00:06:21] Speaker 2: Well, LEDs are better. Mhmm.

Was just also thinking in terms of, like, how you know normally, like, how it normally ends up. If those normally end up all jumbled up together anyways, then just Put them all together in this, I guess. Or at least put them by types or maybe all by colors or something. Oh, well, I mean, that was just, like, I was saying, like, as a way to determine how you order. I mean, somehow or another, you jumbled up all of those things when they perfectly organized. So that's why I was like, I mean, if they get jumbled up anyways, then just jumble them up, I guess. Or put them, like, I don't know. Just organize it based on how you operate, I guess, in But don't put them where they'll get jumbled up with, like, big stuff and then you'll never find them. Uh-huh.  [00:01:47] User: Okay.

[00:00:11] User: Was it a light bulb?  [00:00:13] Speaker 1: Mhmm. I just had to get it out of my hands so I could give it to  [00:00:17] User: Let me put it right both  [00:00:19] Speaker 1: sides.  [00:00:20] User: Maybe. I don't know. I'm doing it  [00:00:23] Speaker 1: over.  [00:00:24] User: Do not have to follow me through this. Know, but she's just gonna have to call me.

Organization that I guess. Because I in that bucket.  [00:00:41] User: Mhmm. And  [00:00:43] Speaker 1: the missing green?  [00:00:45] User: You mean the  [00:00:46] Speaker 1: icon? Yeah.  [00:00:48] User: Do you  [00:00:49] Speaker 1: mean? Well, like, I I found them Ready. But now since they had already been found,  [00:00:55] User: But shouldn't that be used for something where that there's actually a more use for all the Space. I mean, the  [00:01:01] Speaker 1: smaller There's still, like, a lot more electronics, I should. Like, I was gonna put all the light bulbs in here. Like, those are electrical. Like,  [00:01:09] User: But there's not that many cubbies in there.  [00:01:12] Speaker 1: Well, we're gonna separate them by light bulbs and put all the light bulbs in one section  [00:01:16] User: Okay.  [00:01:17] Speaker 1: Because, like, I don't have enough light bulbs. Of each different light bulb to Have you tried both of those on the section? Tipsy, go lay down, dude. Go. No. Not this way. Go. Well,  [00:01:28] User: since I might have had some sort of, like, of an idea, maybe you might be curious just to  [00:01:32] Speaker 2: see what I  [00:01:34] User: was going with. What what did  [00:01:36] Speaker 1: you have in mind?  [00:01:38] Speaker 2: I mean,  [00:01:40] User: you really wanna know?  [00:01:42] Speaker 2: I have Yes.  [00:01:44] Speaker 1: Yes. I really wanna know.  [00:01:47] User: But you only asked  [00:01:49] Speaker 2: them.  [00:01:50] Speaker 1: No. Babe, I want to know. Please tell  [00:01:53] Speaker 2: me.  [00:01:54] User: I was thinking that it would be most beneficial the first, like, its universality. So the light bulbs would all go together, but necessarily with the electrical stuff that you use on all kinds of things. Right? That's what I was thinking. And, I mean, they could just go in a container where you don't cause you don't always need them when you need that. So you need those things. But those things also aren't numerous enough to tick up to make use of that thing as much And also, it just depends on what you need to be mobile or not mostly, I guess. So I don't know, like, what kinds of tools you use with those necessarily. Not all of the tools you use with that stuff. But I have an idea on some of it. I mean, I had questions, like, for Like, you to answer more so so I could figure out, like, what things went with what, but they should be grouped or like, proved or categorized based on their general usage or their specific usage. Tipsy. Nope. Tipsy, go.  [00:03:07] Speaker 1: Go go down, dude. Goddamn.  [00:03:10] User: Water? Like, gee. Mingo potty? What?  [00:03:13] Speaker 2: You  [00:03:14] Speaker 1: have  [00:03:15] Speaker 2: water?  [00:03:16] User: You do have it, sir. Sorry. You're annoying. Like, section or, like, spot.  [00:03:20] Speaker 1: And  [00:03:21] User: like, anything that's, like, specific for the Subaru that doesn't go with anything else doesn't need to end with other things. I don't think. Because that just makes things hard to find and also, like, if you're going to work on stuff for the Subaru and you need those things, then you take those things or whatever or you have those things easily, like, to be mobile. To go do that, I guess. Or wherever. And that's just in general, I guess. Your Jeep stuff should be with Jeep stuff, I think. Mean, I don't think you have that many, like, Jeep parts, but so I mean, it could be that the Subaru and Jeep stuff are together, but, like, sort of separate. I don't know. But they don't need to be intertwined with the general stuff that you have that are, like, consumables and that you use for just like, you can use for multiple different, like, things. But  [00:04:25] Speaker 2: so  [00:04:26] Speaker 3: I mean, you said you had enough of these to fill up all 4 of those things. Or more of them more than that to fill up all of those things.  [00:04:32] Speaker 1: And a lot more than  [00:04:34] Speaker 2: this  [00:04:35] Speaker 1: like, in my room. Yeah. Sex and then, like, still have more fucking nuts and bolts and shit. In the fucking in the Subaru, like, the fucking the Ford board is full. Yeah. Of fucking nuts and bolts and shit.  [00:04:47] Speaker 2: So  [00:04:48] User: Yeah. So  [00:04:50] Speaker 3: this is a good thought. Well, I don't know. I think you need to put everything in one spot anyways, like, before you even try to organize it because you don't even know how space you have unless you are willing or already planning on getting rid of a bunch of stuff, which  [00:05:02] Speaker 2: maybe.  [00:05:03] Speaker 3: Mean, at least the stuff that's like dirty and kind of messed up that you would have to fix first before being able to use or something That's Mhmm. Like, right? Or super rusted or something that you know you never actually gonna use because you have newer ones anyways. Right?  [00:05:15] User: What do you want, Sajid? Go go right now.  [00:05:18] Speaker 2: On. Tipsy, go lay down. Tipsy,  [00:05:21] Speaker 1: go fucking lay down.  [00:05:23] Speaker 0: Read my lips. And know you can't hear me. Chill.

Oh, the size? Okay. So  [00:05:41] Speaker 1: Tipsy, you fucking stay. This isn't a fucking game. Lay down, dude.  [00:05:45] User: Down. No.  [00:05:46] Speaker 1: You know, good girl. Good girl. She was that so hard? No. Oh, god. Damn it.  [00:05:50] User: She's like, let me see once in a day. She's like, no.  [00:05:53] Speaker 2: Like, where is she  [00:05:55] User: gonna go right now? Like, really? Actually, like, right?  [00:05:59] Speaker 1: Do dogs get dementia? What's she  [00:06:01] Speaker 2: doing? I don't know.  [00:06:02] User: Nope. Sorry. I didn't mean to look at you. I mean, I looked at it.  [00:06:05] Speaker 2: So yeah.  [00:06:06] User: So anyways, so They just don't know size.  [00:06:09] Speaker 2: Right?  [00:06:10] Speaker 1: Like, for the gauge wire that's supposed to be used on?  [00:06:13] User: So are these all the same wide size  [00:06:15] Speaker 1: gauge wire  [00:06:17] Speaker 2: then?

I'll never experience it like that or   [00:04:15] Speaker 2: or just  [00:04:16] Speaker 1: I'll never know more, what it's like. That's like saying that's like the equivalent equivalent of saying that, like, but, you know what it's like to be hurt or scared so just you yeah. You would never know that exact feeling in or that exact type of sphere. But it if you can imagine or if you have ever felt fear at all, then you can empathize You can understand, and then therefore, just imagine you being scared. That's what this person's feeling.  [00:05:01] Speaker 2: But, like, have you ever You're being automatically judged and fucking negatively judged at just because of your skin color just because the area that you're in, you fucking walk in the store.  [00:05:11] Speaker 1: That's not a feeling, though. A don't feel it because of my skin color. But, yes, I have been automatically judged and felt, like, felt the this the, like,  [00:05:18] Speaker 2: criminal  [00:05:19] Speaker 1: That's not a feeling, though, still. Like, it's just a it's just a singling out, and you're not being  [00:05:24] Speaker 2: like,  [00:05:25] Speaker 1: I mean, I but I don't know how to explain it. Obviously, no. Because I might. I don't get those same kind same kind of, like, discrimination. But I but you can't say but I I would never say that but I can't imagine what it would feel like,  [00:05:33] Speaker 2: though,  [00:05:34] Speaker 1: because, I, like, I know that would suck, and I would fucking hate it. So I don't understand that takes how you could say that you don't know. Like,  [00:05:43] Speaker 0: Would get me different treatment than my being black does get me  [00:05:46] Speaker 1: Yes. That would just be the fact that you're not just painted as good or bad. Instead of good or good or whatever. By default or being the team. Default. But why is just the default? what does that do?  [00:06:01] Speaker 2: There's a difference or there's, like, I can imagine this versus  [00:06:05] Speaker 1: Great.  [00:06:06] Speaker 2: I actually feel this, like, fucking negative by, just saying the fucking a white person they would have they would have to imagine the feeling that a black person would have  [00:06:12] Speaker 1: Okay. Maybe if you would say this, it's I didn't know what you're saying. I'm No. Actually, no. Still  [00:06:17] User: kind  [00:06:18] Speaker 1: of no because I get it. No. We don't actually we're not in your shoes because the color of your skin makes all these things a reality for you. So now I've I don't have black kids, so no. I can't possibly know. What it's like to have black skin and fit like, deal with the the fucking societal, like, stigma with that. Like, but That's regardless. I don't understand the point in saying this is, like so, like, saying this to me after, like, I'm saying  [00:06:41] Speaker 2: that  [00:06:42] Speaker 1: I don't need to have black skinned. Do understand that that's not okay. The whole point in saying that you don't know what it's like or why people never know is  [00:06:49] Speaker 2: that  [00:06:50] Speaker 1: because there are some white people who deny it. Whatsoever, like, completely.  [00:06:54] Speaker 0: Just just like  [00:06:55] Speaker 1: the racial, you know, interracial relationships aren't as stigmatized as they are. But as you know, from, like, the fucking fucking work.  [00:07:01] User: No. I  [00:07:02] Speaker 1: know. They they they still are stigmatized by ignorant motherfuckers. That you know, fucking got got it from the fence that fucking got it from their parents, but call them. And it's like, But And it's like it's just  [00:07:12] User: the churn and stuff.  [00:07:13] Speaker 1: But, yeah, It's not it's not it's not the fucking there is a difference between white and black because we are all the fucking same. But it's a the history that goes with the ignorance in this country So whenever fucking whenever, like, like, when I was in Maryland and shit, Like, before I was any fucking sort of criminal like, at all, I was fucking that way, I don't know. It was just like I could walk in the store with my with my wife, friends, and fucking eyes would be on me.  [00:08:01] User: Of course.  [00:08:02] Speaker 1: Solely me. Yeah. Of course. You know what I mean? And My wife, they did fucking They didn't they didn't know what the fuck the deal was. Like, they didn't know even notice the shit was happening. Yeah.  [00:08:12] User: I mean  [00:08:13] Speaker 1: I mean,  [00:08:14] User: They were told that there is no such thing as racism anymore.  [00:08:16] Speaker 1: That's that's that's a microcosm of what what I got from him saying that fucking wife is gonna walk little little bit more towards me and put the plug. And, unfortunately, my wife friends will never know that ceiling. Where it's like you just walk in the place You can be fucking buying nice clothes this year. That's Not even fucking working, like, a hoodlobe or what the fuck every, you know,  [00:09:01] User: But if you're not aware, then  [00:09:02] Speaker 1: you  [00:09:03] User: don't know. Like, I  [00:09:04] Speaker 1: I  [00:09:05] User: wouldn't have known, like, being a kid, I wouldn't have recognized that or known my, one of my friends, some of those black weight was having that kind of pressure, that kind of like, you know, and that I wasn't or just whatever. But now that I am aware of this kind of stuff, Like, I would still I would feel it if I was walking in with you and you were being watched or something like that. Why wouldn't I feel it? Why wouldn't I know? Or be like  [00:09:29] Speaker 1: But like, yes, You you be able to feel it. You'd be able to observe it, but you wouldn't you wouldn't know what it would like,  [00:09:36] User: I don't know. I guess what I'm not getting is that I feel like you're trying to say or that you are saying I know you're saying that we can't like, I can't literally feedback and experience these things. Like, I know this. But to say that I can't see it and know what it feels like or like, is the is is contrary to how human emotions and empathy works. This is the thing that is, like, that's the only reason why we care about some to save somebody who's hurting or whatever. Is because we can put ourselves in that in that pain and imagine how they feel. You know? So to say, like, you can't know what it feels like is I've it's feel like it's a simplification that doesn't do any justice. And actually kind of makes people not do anything at all. In a way. Because they if we're if we're The 5 year old told you can't possibly know then what the fuck? Then why should we do try? We can't possibly know. We don't know what it's like. Email? I I don't know.  [00:10:42] Speaker 1: I see what you're saying. But, like, I I don't I don't know fucking how to put it in the fucking words. Like, I I just  [00:11:01] Speaker 0: Citizens. It was like a Okay. Exactly. So the fact that that's where they I mean, maybe maybe, sis, Maybe, like, I do get what you're saying. Like, I can't I don't know what it's like to feel that the and to live with that kind of pressure or that kind of, like, constant, like  [00:11:13] Speaker 1: It's it's a  [00:11:14] User: it's  [00:11:15] Speaker 1: a 1,000,000,000 fucking it's a 1,000,000 fucking tiny things. Yeah. You know what I  [00:11:19] User: mean? Like, I've never feel that anxiety or that kind of, like, just  [00:11:24] Speaker 1: Right.  [00:11:25] User: Anything like that. Like, I you're right.  [00:11:27] Speaker 1: Get right. Every time I see a cop and I say, fuck the police, You know what I mean? Like, that's that's like a fucking legitimate. Like, I  [00:11:33] Speaker 0: Like, you're just people who are, like, let's go kill let let's go catch some black people worse. Property of some Thank you. Bridge white people. Who, who profit and exploit off of me and also don't hire me or give me a job because they have free labor kind of thing. It's just like all work against our own best interest like, I mean, I know it's shown me some videos, but so people who are, like, black guys who live in the more in the Imparas, and people are, like, Hello? Like, more stereotypical like, appearing on the in their appearance or something like that. Right. And they're being, like, targeted or specifically, like, you you can tell that it's just like a a race thing for sure that the comp is, like, all on their high horse about it kind You know, I mean, I Do you ever, like, do you ever see that, or have you ever seen that and been like, what the  [00:12:34] Speaker 1: fuck? Like, I know.  [00:12:35] Speaker 2: Shit like that. Like, fucking the first time on ever arrested, I was a victim of fucking racial targeting  [00:12:39] User: I'm not talking  [00:12:40] Speaker 1: about  [00:12:41] User: I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about something that's, like, different from your kind  [00:12:45] Speaker 2: of like,  [00:12:46] User: I'm sure people who were in over police areas who are dealing with cops all the time, plus the violence, plus the, like, the the  [00:12:50] Speaker 1: the  [00:12:51] User: fact that they can't get out of the situation out of the the fucking violence or gang. What In that whole all of that that goes along with  [00:12:56] Speaker 2: being in  [00:12:57] User: the  [00:12:58] Speaker 2: I  [00:12:59] Speaker 1: guess,  [00:13:00] User: Uh-huh.  [00:13:01] Speaker 2: Yeah. I know. Yeah.  [00:13:02] Speaker 1: But  [00:13:03] User: I wouldn't call  [00:13:03] Speaker 2: that.  [00:13:04] Speaker 1: The people the fucking  [00:13:05] User: the areas where,  [00:13:06] Speaker 1: yeah, they're Sure. Yeah. There you go. Go ahead. Right. Like knowing all of that without action knowing what it's like to be there but still feel like able to be like, what the fuck? Like, that's fucked up. Like, I don't know. Like, you don't have to be there or have, like, I don't know. I do not explain  [00:13:26] Speaker 2: it.  [00:13:27] Speaker 1: But, actually, not  [00:13:28] Speaker 2: no.  [00:13:29] Speaker 1: Perfect and perfect and analogy that is literally the exact same thing. You're saying that it's you like, I can say, are they you don't know. You can't know what it feels like. To be like, constantly reminded how it's only your appearance that makes you have any value to so many people. Like, you can't pass  [00:13:32] Speaker 2: Correct.  [00:13:33] Speaker 1: Or what I talked to was, like,  [00:13:35] Speaker 2: Correct. But then I mean, I can empathize with the mule. You know, fucking that's fucking  [00:13:37] Speaker 1: trash.  [00:13:38] Speaker 2: And fucking shit like that. Exists, but, like, from from me to say that I truly know That feeling would be alive.  [00:13:43] Speaker 1: I'm not but I'm not saying you like, you I but first of all, I would never say that because I think that's a stupid thing to say. I would hope that you would be able to like, seek to understand how it would feel. So I would never say you can't pause understand because then that's just giving you an excuse to not try and understand You know? Like, I don't want you to not understand. I want you to actually, like, think about and figure out as me questions. I don't know. Try to put your yourself in a situation  [00:14:09] Speaker 2: where  [00:14:10] Speaker 1: literally your mind doesn't matter at all to people. When you talk. It's just that, like, oh, you're  [00:14:12] Speaker 2: pretty,  [00:14:13] Speaker 1: and  [00:14:14] Speaker 2: so  [00:14:15] Speaker 1: that's all that matters. Kind of thing. Or, like, that literally I don't know.  [00:14:18] Speaker 2: I  [00:14:19] Speaker 1: mean, I'm I'm not I don't want you to feel like Well, I can't possibly know what's, like, to be. You told me a young, pretty white female one time. I was like, I what?  [00:14:21] Speaker 3: What do you  [00:14:22] Speaker 1: mean? Are you trying to say that you can't possibly, like, understand like, any of the things, like,  [00:14:27] Speaker 2: that  [00:14:28] Speaker 1: I feel  [00:14:29] Speaker 2: or  [00:14:30] Speaker 1: my struggles or whatever. No. No. I'm  [00:14:31] Speaker 2: not that I can't, like, hear your struggle on this. Right. Get to know, like, your feelings and the struggle that that you have I'm not saying that I  [00:14:36] Speaker 1: fucking  [00:14:37] Speaker 2: any of that on the sit up. I'm set up. My it's it's second But now  [00:14:40] Speaker 3: that  [00:14:41] Speaker 2: step That, like, another step or wave from from that and this, like, further into you to where I can I can't fully 100% know? What is, like, to be a female like, and have so much riding on my parents and fucking  [00:14:51] Speaker 1: It literally doesn't take care feel like anything specific because if if it were a thing where patriarchy would or is was like a was the opposite and somehow or another it was a domination of no because of major arc is actually not the same thing even though it seems like it. It's not It's not. I   [00:15:01] Speaker 2: promise.  [00:15:02] Speaker 1: But just being the opposite. Then it would just literally be that all of the the d value would be from the men's body, and that's it. They are, like, they are value for their their mind. Basically, maybe we just use them for their strength, and that was it. If they were weak, then whatever. If they were I don't know. Like, if that was literally the only important Like, you had like, any value other than that you for entertainment. You are used for, like, just, like, props. You were just constantly, like, made to, like, show yourself and I don't  [00:15:44] Speaker 2: know.  [00:15:45] Speaker 1: Then then you  [00:15:46] Speaker 2: could  [00:15:47] Speaker 1: say, well, you can't possibly know what it's like. Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't feel like anything in particular. It doesn't feel like anything. It's the feeling of having this Like, being objectified that is the feeling, and you are very much able to understand a bit. Would feel like. So to say, like, you can't understand what it's like to be a woman, or if you or a female or anything like that. No. Just woman. Like,  [00:16:01] User: I mean,  [00:16:02] Speaker 1: what do you mean? You know what these things would like, what these things are and how, like, if you were in my shoes, it I not good. You know? I mean, Yeah. Like, you're right. I don't have your ID. Your eye.  [00:16:07] Speaker 2: Imagine what it's like to  [00:16:08] Speaker 3: be  [00:16:09] Speaker 1: you. That's fine. I guess  [00:16:10] Speaker 3: I don't  [00:16:11] Speaker 2: need  [00:16:12] Speaker 1: to  [00:16:13] Speaker 2: what the point  [00:16:14] Speaker 1: that's like that says, like, I would I would have to imagine what it's like to be you whereas That's  [00:16:19] Speaker 1: fine, though. I  [00:16:20] Speaker 3: guess  [00:16:21] Speaker 2: You would have to imagine what it's like  [00:16:22] Speaker 3: to be mean?  [00:16:23] Speaker 1: Yeah.  [00:16:24] Speaker 3: You're  [00:16:25] User: right. But  [00:16:26] Speaker 3: I  [00:16:27] Speaker 1: need to do that in order for  [00:16:28] Speaker 3: ending  [00:16:29] Speaker 1: like,  [00:16:30] Speaker 2: let me just say it. Like, it's that's that's it right there. Like, it's  [00:16:31] Speaker 1: I guess I don't get what I guess I don't get it. And I not since I mean, I I understand what you're saying. I'm trying to tell you that I do get what you're saying. But I don't get the significance of saying that. At all because that's like saying, well, my friend had her most of her parents got cancer, didn't cancer and died. I can say all day, I don't know what that feels like. I can't possibly know what that feels like. But, what does that mean? Do I just, like, act like something's, like, that she's sad about nothing or whatever, or like, no. I imagine that that's fucking horrible. And I would absolutely do something about it. That's for my headphone to me. I'm sorry? My Headband Jack. But, like, that's it's also the same as saying, like, you can't possibly know what it's like to be somebody else and feel what they're like, if they had some sort of health problem  [00:17:01] that they deal  [00:17:02] with every day, like, of course, like, you can't you  [00:17:03] can't  [00:17:04] Speaker 1: like, literally feel their anxiety, their pain, everything that's all, like, compounded from all of these different things. In in, like, that's happened or just ongoing, either like, with their health or just their this Yeah. Everything. Their trauma is past experiences, whatever. Of course, you you can't know that. But that's not the that's not the idea. Like, that's, like, everybody's different in that sense. You can't know. But the thing the part that we're supposed to do or try to do is to understand the situations that society can change or do to make people to stop causing these pressures that put people in this state of the whatever it is. You know? That's what I'm saying. Like, it's not a thing of, like, you not understanding. Like, I don't want you to know what it's like to feel to be me and deal with the anxieties or the first frustration or the,  [00:18:01] Speaker 3: like,  [00:18:02] Speaker 1: the, like, the hopelessness or whatever it is or the disgust, just like dealing with people who are literally don't see you as human. I don't want you to feel like that. I don't want anybody to feel like that. The goal the my point is that the idea is that you should recognize it, like, should want to change it because you don't want anybody to feel like that. You know? Like, that's what I'm saying.  [00:18:22] Speaker 2: I think  [00:18:23] Speaker 3: good.  [00:18:24] Speaker 2: I agree with that. Like, but, like, I I the thing I don't agree with is, like, because me not being able to fucking Like, just just for the example, please just, like, hear me out. Me not knowing what his life would be female. Dozen just just me personally it doesn't make me not want to be able to empathize with you You know what I mean? Like, it it doesn't I'm not just saying, well, I'll what calendar have you delivered this slide? For killing females, so why not even gonna fucking try to, but I  [00:18:46] Speaker 1: Like, I just I I didn't say that. I was I literally told you that I know that you  [00:18:49] Speaker 3: can I  [00:18:50] Speaker 2: know that you didn't say that a  [00:18:51] Speaker 3: me?  [00:18:52] Speaker 1: No. I know. I'm just saying I didn't Okay. Sorry. Keep  [00:18:54] Speaker 3: going.  [00:18:55] Speaker 2: Right.  [00:18:56] Speaker 1: 10  [00:18:57] User: It's  [00:18:58] Speaker 2: not It's 8 not to me, and it shouldn't be to anybody else. A reason to fucking not try to understand or try to fix the issue because, like,  [00:19:01] Speaker 1: yeah.  [00:19:02] Speaker 2: I I don't know what it's like to fucking be a woman in any regard. But I can recognize the fucking the the impression I can't I can recognize that, you know, fucking people fucking only look at look at you and my literally only see your physicality starting to fucking care about what the fuck's coming out of your fucking mouth? Or worse in your brain. Like, that's fucking shitty.  [00:19:26] Speaker 1: And are you imagining yourself in that position? And how it would  [00:19:28] Speaker 3: feel?  [00:19:29] Speaker 2: And I I my my son as in my imagination I guarantee I do it just No,  [00:19:31] Speaker 1: God.  [00:19:32] Speaker 3: So  [00:19:33] Speaker 1: then why do you then why wish you wanted change it? Why do you think there is something that needs to be changed if you can't imagine what it feels like? Do  [00:19:38] Speaker 2: you agree with me?  [00:19:39] Speaker 1: That's why. Don't get mad at me. I'm asking you. I'm just asking you to give me a quest give me an answer to somebody.  [00:19:43] Speaker 3: You  [00:19:44] Speaker 1: are mad. You tone of voice Brian, really  [00:19:45] Speaker 2: Bye.  [00:19:46] Speaker 1: You literally just said I fucking answered Like, how are you gonna tell me you're not mad? Or at least, like, not giving, like, defensive.  [00:19:51] Speaker 2: Because I I  [00:19:52] Speaker 1: But how is saying I fucking answered not being defensive? I'm not saying  [00:19:55] Speaker 2: it's not being defensive.  [00:19:56] Speaker 1: Okay. So then I'm but I asked you how you can know Oh, how you could want to change anything if you can't even imagine that the feeling in be it being a bad thing.  [00:20:01] Speaker 3: Okay.  [00:20:02] Speaker 2: You're not hearing what I'm saying.  [00:20:03] Speaker 1: Okay.  [00:20:04] Speaker 2: I did say that  [00:20:05] Speaker 3: I  [00:20:06] Speaker 1: can imagine  [00:20:07] Speaker 2: I  [00:20:08] Speaker 1: can  [00:20:09] Speaker 3: imagine  [00:20:10] Speaker 2: what you  [00:20:11] Speaker 3: it  [00:20:12] Speaker 2: feels like to go  [00:20:13] Speaker 3: to be in your  [00:20:14] Speaker 2: shoes. I can't imagine but I can also So it means that what I can imagine isn't doing it justice  [00:20:17] Speaker 3: that  [00:20:18] Speaker 2: fucking white you have to go to this Multitudes higher than what I can imagine you going through So, yes, I  [00:20:22] Speaker 3: can  [00:20:23] Speaker 2: say that fucking from what I can go imagine, like that shit's fucked up and then these to change.  [00:20:27] Speaker 3: Okay.  [00:20:28] Speaker 1: But I  [00:20:29] Speaker 3: don't Is that  [00:20:30] Speaker 2: my does that make any  [00:20:31] Speaker 1: sense?  [00:20:32] Speaker 3: I understand what you're saying, but what I  [00:20:34] Speaker 2: said didn't But  [00:20:35] Speaker 1: what I said didn't get answered by that whatsoever, really. I mean, I get that you're saying you can't know exactly  [00:20:39] Speaker 3: how much like,  [00:20:40] Speaker 1: how city  [00:20:41] Speaker 3: house  [00:20:42] Speaker 2: city  [00:20:43] Speaker 1: feels. Like, there's a measurement But that didn't address the fact that I've already I've already, like, like, accounted for that.  [00:20:51] Speaker 3: Just because  [00:20:52] Speaker 1: I I put this the whole like, example around and making it said that males were male  [00:20:54] Speaker 3: People were the ones being dominated or in the, like, on this lower rungs of the hierarchy or whatever,  [00:21:00] Speaker 1: and explains or and, like, gave the scenario where You would be in the exact situation. As a woman As women are today, or and throughout history, and  [00:21:07] Speaker 3: like,  [00:21:08] Speaker 1: Basically, I wouldn't have to deal with that kind of, like, those kinds of worries. But  [00:21:15] Speaker 3: you would.  [00:21:16] Speaker 1: You would have to worry about those those things. Knowing that you weren't valued for anything else. And so I asked you, like, I don't understand, like, how that's sick.  [00:21:22] Speaker 3: like, measurement. I'm sure there are there there because some  [00:21:24] Speaker 2: women who feel it more than others who, like, are affected by it more than others. Others, is there like a there's no, like, measurement. There's no amount that should be, like,  [00:21:30] Speaker 1: This should be  [00:21:31] Speaker 3: Like, manageable or whatever. Like, I'm I'm just think that, like, if you conceal the kind of, like,  [00:21:35] Speaker 1: The the  [00:21:36] Speaker 3: I don't know what the word is, but  [00:21:37] Speaker 2: did  [00:21:38] Speaker 3: devaluation and the objectification kind of if you can feel any level of that at all, if you're capable of understanding that, that's fucked up or whatever. That's shitty. That, like, how would you feel to be reduced to nothing but a body and you know, Then that's all that's needed. I mean, just saying that you're not able to, like, do injustice is kinda like, well, what do you mean? Like, I don't like, I don't even know what that means really. Because I don't want anybody to feel like this acts off the ID. The idea is to know that  [00:22:02] User: do it just to suggest an expression. Like like, I  [00:22:03] Speaker 3: I'm not not no. Hey.  [00:22:04] Speaker 1: Do  [00:22:05] Speaker 2: not tell somebody  [00:22:06] Speaker 3: that please  [00:22:07] Speaker 1: Stop.  [00:22:08] Speaker 3: Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. I don't wanna do semantics. Okay? I was not trying to to be I was not trying to do semantics on you saying it do it justice. Okay? But the point I was saying was that you were saying still that you would not be able to understand it to some sort of, like, degree that I am able to. So, therefore, it's, like, not the same thing. Like, I'm telling you that I don't understand how that's possible. I'm telling you as of as a woman, that you can absolutely understand and feel the same kind of, like, just the same kind of degradation or whatever it is per Let's Other people or just society in general, and your place in it, Ask me. Is it you have to be me to feel it or to understand it or to see it or to just, like, know that, okay, that's shitty. Like, I mean, people can handle it in different ways. There could be other things that mean nothing to do with me being female,  [00:23:01] Speaker 2: that  [00:23:02] Speaker 3: make this that feeling  [00:23:03] Speaker 2: worse or  [00:23:04] Speaker 3: not as bad or whatever. So I Like, that's feeling as the certain, like, I don't know. I I just feel like that's in important thing and just saying you saying that you can't possibly understand or feel like doing it justice or whatever, I think that that's false. I think that you can feel just as deeply about it as you, like, as you choose  [00:23:18] Speaker 1: to as you  [00:23:19] Speaker 3: choose to seek to understand as you choose to put yourself in in somebody else's shoes. That's all up to you. So I'm the thing of, like, no. You literally can't be me and like, face the things  [00:23:23] Speaker 0: To taper just like rest. Like, Karen fucking doesn't do any fucked me after put the fuck of Yes. It's Oh, like, my hands are dirty.  [00:23:27] Speaker 1: Scars and privates in my fucking hand from what missing perform, like, the drug is, like, fucking spitting me out of the fucking drugs. Yeah. Now  [00:23:32] User: that's all trash. I mean, there were very few like, Lego things. Don't k. I promise if it was if it was Yes. Oh my gosh. I think you had so many of those, and I had so many of those whatever I threw a couple of those away. They're really  [00:23:41] Speaker 1: ugly.  [00:23:42] User: But those are the only kinds of things I thoroughly Okay. But these things, are things that I maybe wanted to tell away. Some of them I did have, like, questions about, though, for sure. Like, these things, you had a bunch of these out  [00:23:49] Speaker 2: actually. So, actually, I don't think that they were  [00:23:51] Speaker 1: Those are valve guys.  [00:23:52] Speaker 2: Okay. So don't trash them.  [00:23:53] Speaker 1: I  [00:23:54] Speaker 2: mean, I didn't trash trash some of them, but then I would like, once I realized you had so many of them. Look like they've had a oil on them. They're not necessarily  [00:24:01] Speaker 1: the utilities. Probably come to an end.  [00:24:02] Speaker 2: That one looks like a dickhead. Yeah.  [00:24:04] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:06:21] [Speaker 0]: About where I used to be, and there's still you can talk to certain people, and there's still that little glimmer of hope for for a while. The prison walls are sustaining I ain't gonna pull it out.  [00:06:30] [Speaker 1]: Do you hear  [00:06:31] [Speaker 0]: saying that fucking everybody wants  [00:06:34] [Speaker 1]: the The prison act, but just because it'll be jobs for them. No. that's, like, I don't know. Like, that's yeah, this fucking sucks. Like, that there's not something better The light.  [00:06:44] [Speaker 2]: Wait. What do you mean?  [00:06:46] [Speaker 1]: Like, the the the the town is, like, so small with nothing to fucking do. Or whatever that there's no jobs So, like, they want the prison back so they're fucking they can have jobs. Like, that yeah. It sucks that, like, that's that that that's a thing. But, like, I mean, at least, like, they they, like, mowing the fucking work, I guess. I don't know. I don't know.  [00:07:02] [Speaker 2]: You see the prisoners as humans?  [00:07:05] [Speaker 1]: Do  [00:07:06] [Speaker 2]: you think that they do? What do you think? Think that you see it as a job? That's the part I was saying was that They want the prison back Meaning, if there were no meaning, they want people incarcerated so that they can have jobs. Their fellow human beings who are no doubt in the same, like, cost as they are. So that they could just have jobs. Just the jobs. Not because they believe in what they're doing and not the fact that what they're doing with that or that what fits how demoralizing that job is, nothing, It's not like about wanting to work out, them wanting to work Yeah. But why like, advocating for that kind of work? I'm not saying it's their fault. I don't think that they think about it at all like that, but that's kind of the idea. I don't want you to, like, think about  [00:07:35] [Speaker 1]: it.  [00:07:36] [Speaker 2]: This individual, like, yourself, just worry about yourself kind of thing.  [00:07:39] [Speaker 1]: I mean, I was I was thinking more for, like, like, convenience, like, the whole fucking week. Town if they were dependent on the prison for the fucking because it's not it's not just the prison itself because, like, you have people from all over fucking the state in that prison And so you have you have people coming to visit him on the weekends and shit. So there are fucking hotels, you know, gas stations. Restaurants, you know, shit like that. Those all get a spike in business as well. Yeah.  [00:08:01] [Speaker 2]: But who profits from this?  [00:08:03] [Speaker 1]: I mean, I'm not I'm not saying it's fucking good. Or, like, I'm for prison because obviously, I'm anti prison, maybe? Wait. I can just see, like, how like, fucking, like, condo where your fucking tourist unit is. They they have, like, a fucking nothing out there. Damn. Jack shit out there. But on the weekends, when fucking everybody's coming from all over the state to visit their folks, in prison or whatever, fucking There's business. You know what I mean?  [00:08:23] [Speaker 2]: But is that a good  [00:08:24] [Speaker 1]: thing? I mean, for a small small town economy.  [00:08:27] [Speaker 2]: Shouldn't it just be that businesses want to build business there for people to work at so that the community can drive.  [00:08:32] [Speaker 1]: But if there's no clientele, there's no business.  [00:08:35] [Speaker 2]: There are clientele. What do you  [00:08:37] [Speaker 1]: mean?  [00:08:38] [Speaker 2]: The clientele are the people who live there.  [00:08:40] [Speaker 1]: Wait. If there's no if there's no jobs, there's no money. So like, the people that live there don't have money to spend, and the businesses that are open for  [00:08:47] [Speaker 2]: Well, you're right. But that's right. People in that community shouldn't have to have a lot of capital in order to open a business and take care of the community. But unfortunately, that's the way it is. You have people, like, with lots of money owning all of the property in that small town and not letting like, not allowing anybody with big corporations to find a lot of profit. Profit, like, instead of to go there I mean, I don't know. The people who benefit from it are not the people who live there necessarily. Yeah. They get jobs, but they don't ever rise up. They don't have any upward mobility whatsoever. I'm working at a hotel or working at McDonald's or working at the There's no upper mobility for them. I'm just living life as, like,  [00:09:29] [Speaker 2]: me to see an airplane flying overhead. When an airplane rocks their wings, they're waving at  [00:09:33] [User]: you.  [00:09:34] [Speaker 2]: There's no airports. You know? We had no land for airports.  [00:09:37] [User]: Really?  [00:09:38] [Speaker 2]: Level land is at a premium here in always say, good morning, make level in here.  [00:09:42] [User]: Hello? Is it  [00:09:43] [Speaker 2]: a  [00:09:44] [Speaker 1]: coal  [00:09:45] [Speaker 2]: company, sir?  [00:09:46] [User]: I think so.  [00:09:47] [Speaker 1]: When you mine the  [00:09:48] [Speaker 2]: coal, and then you haul the coal out of here. And, and that layout is enormous piece of level land it was done.  [00:09:54] [Speaker 1]: The  [00:09:55] [Speaker 2]: air we're standing on now once was, Probably higher than  [00:09:57] [User]: That's crazy.  [00:09:58] [Speaker 2]: Everything on top of this particular mountain is built on a reclaimed surface mat. The airport industrial park, the federal prison, was built on a reclaimed surface line. With the co industry gone, I don't see eastern Kentucky getting better unless something else comes in  [00:10:12] [User]: here. See,  [00:10:14] [Speaker 3]: that's the issue, I think. Like, that these companies have profiting profiting off people. They have jobs while they're there, and then they just and leave them and then that's why they get into these things where they're, like, nobody's got jobs and shit like that because the corporation who were profiting off of their labor there just decided, oh, Bye. No more cold. Bye. No more yeah. So it's like I'm the next  [00:10:35] [Speaker 1]: time.  [00:10:36] [Speaker 3]: And so now you  [00:10:37] [Speaker 2]: get  [00:10:38] [Speaker 3]: this advocating for other people to come and profit off of, like, exploiting them and then also exploiting, like, ruining the lives of  [00:10:45] [Speaker 2]: others. 400 people. My son-in-law is one of them. It's for station It's recession proof. You you close the factory down and you ship the jobs overseas. You can't do that to the federal president.  [00:10:55] [Speaker 3]: What? Well, you could just shut it down. Mhmm. What I mean? Bad  [00:10:59] [Speaker 2]: chance.  [00:11:00] [Speaker 3]: Yeah. Like, no. You were right. We wouldn't we wouldn't worry about the jobs for prison being I mean, granted, we do have a lot of Nigerians who have jobs,  [00:11:05] [Speaker 2]: like, for  [00:11:06] [Speaker 3]: so that's kind of a questionable.  [00:11:08] [Speaker 4]: That's fucking yeah.  [00:11:09] [Speaker 3]: We don't ship the jobs overseas. We bring the the over here for the jobs.  [00:11:12] [Speaker 4]: Alright. And that motherfuckers, they're late. They fucking hate black people. Like like and there's African American Africans hate African Americans. No. Not  [00:11:17] [Speaker 5]: all of them.  [00:11:19] [Speaker 4]: That's okay. I mean, not all of them. Just talking about, like  [00:11:21] [Speaker 3]: Places  [00:11:22] [Speaker 4]: like California. Prison.  [00:11:24] [Speaker 3]: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Well  [00:11:26] [Speaker 4]: done. The ones that work in the prisons, them motherfuckers hate us blacks.  [00:11:30] [Speaker 3]: Of course, they're subjected to them to the American, propaganda that says that this is why we treat them so bad. It, it justifies it in their  [00:11:36] [User]: minds.  [00:11:37] [Speaker 4]: Also, like, the general mentality that the general concept of They they have nothing like what we have over here. Like, as far as, like, fucking ease of life is concerned and shit, and fucking We are over here fucking squandering it over fucking bullshit not doing anything with Like, people in prison and shit. They're not doing anything with what they're fucking like, what we're blessed with  [00:11:56] [Speaker 3]: Supposedly. Supposedly. What we appeared because everybody buys into the American dream from outside of the United States also. So of course we tell people this. I mean, the fact that most people here believe anybody make it if they try kind of thing and everybody, you know, that I mean, just people on the outside definitely see it like that too. If they are from countries that have been heavily, like, like, exported and colonized or whatever by the United States. Of course, our ID and making sure that, like, propaganda reaches their mind soon. Otherwise,  [00:12:24] [User]: Hello?  [00:12:25] [Speaker 3]: But not all  [00:12:27] [User]: Africans. Definitely not all Africans think that way at all. Lot of them know exactly what's going on.  [00:12:31] [Speaker 3]: But the country's, like, I forgot what else said.  [00:12:34] [User]: I don't well, hate Haiti. What? We didn't screen them over for a very long time. It's crazy. Alright. They cut you off? Oh,  [00:12:40] [Speaker 2]: It's all good.  [00:12:41] [Speaker 4]: I was just saying from, like, from my experience, like, in prison, fucking the Nigerians that are working with prisons they fucking hate black people here. For the reasons that I said, like, they fucking like, I've heard the fucking arguments. Like, I've heard them fucking say the shit the mouths.  [00:12:56] [Speaker 3]: What?  [00:12:57] [Speaker 4]: You know, they're fucking  [00:12:59] [Speaker 6]: you you have you have all this opportunity. You have all these chances, and you're here. You're here fucking with me. It's type suit. That's like a video verbatim fucking example of What the what the type of shit that they say. Mhmm. Like, because we do have all kinds of fucking opportunities and and shit here. We don't have to fucking necessarily worry about dying in the night because a fucking lion or tiger will look but it's it's  [00:13:25] [Speaker 4]: easier  [00:13:26] [Speaker 6]: you don't have the threat I don't know. It's it's a different it's a different kind of living. Like, cooking We have we live in the land of excess. They fucking they don't know what the fuck excess is. In Africa. Type shit. You know what I mean? Alright. The general, you know, like, population or  [00:13:42] [Speaker 4]: whatever, but, like, we have fucking so much here. Like,  [00:13:45] [Speaker 3]: Is everybody have so much?  [00:13:47] [Speaker 6]: No. Definitely  [00:13:48] [Speaker 4]: not.  [00:13:50] [Speaker 6]: The, like, that's that's another one of the things that fucking people believe of America is that everybody here has enough to be fat and fucking lazy and fucking don't have to do shit.  [00:13:56] [User]: Right.  [00:13:57] [Speaker 3]: When I said about  [00:14:00] [Speaker 7]: I didn't say that they didn't I didn't say that. I don't know if you heard it from the last.  [00:14:03] [Speaker 6]: Mhmm. But I'm not talking about I wasn't talking about all Africans either. I was only talking about the ones that, like, I had experience with.  [00:14:09] [Speaker 7]: When you said Africans, though, I thought you were saying because we  [00:14:11] [Speaker 6]: were talking because we were talking about the Africans, like, in prison.  [00:14:14] [Speaker 7]: That's in Nigeria specifically, though. Yeah.  [00:14:17] [Speaker 6]: That's what most of them are. They most most of them are from Nigeria. Yeah. CDC  [00:14:20] [Speaker 4]: actually  [00:14:21] [Speaker 6]: fucking, like,  [00:14:22] [Speaker 5]: a  [00:14:23] [Speaker 6]: recruitment policy, like, for Nigeria specifically.  [00:14:26] [Speaker 7]: Yeah. That's what I'm saying. And it's because they the they have the, in propagandized with the right mindset. So That's it.  [00:14:31] [Speaker 6]: Yeah, baby. Great.  [00:14:34] [Speaker 3]: I was like, what? Didn't eat that  [00:14:36] [Speaker 4]: much. I don't know why. I thought that you ate 4 pieces just like I did. No.  [00:14:40] [Speaker 6]: I'm wrong. Stuff  [00:14:42] [Speaker 7]: like that? And did you do you agree with that that those Nigerian that say that kind of stuff?  [00:14:47] [Speaker 4]: Well, that we have all kinds of opportunities and we fuck it  [00:14:50] [Speaker 3]: up? Like, whenever they you saw them say that to people, like, would you be like, yeah. Do you do you, like, agree with that?  [00:14:54] [Speaker 6]: No.  [00:14:56] [Speaker 7]: Thank you very much. Not understanding.  [00:14:58] [Speaker 6]: They just let them cook and run with it.  [00:15:01] [User]: They want them to. Who's they, first of all? Wait. I think the  [00:15:04] [Speaker 6]: The people that fucking hire over there? Yeah. I'm working. Yeah. It's not pleasant.

[00:22:39] [Speaker 8]: We partner with the Detroit  [00:22:41] [Speaker 5]: Police  [00:22:42] [Speaker 8]: the  [00:22:43] [Speaker 7]: state,  [00:22:44] [Speaker 8]: the county, the border patrol. We all work together as a  [00:22:47] [Speaker 9]: team. We  [00:22:48] [Speaker 8]: even have secondary employment, officers. That when they're off duty, they work for us in uniform. We have our own security feet on the street, our own cars. Mhmm. We have bikers We, keep an eye and it is awesome.  [00:22:57] [Speaker 6]: We have bikers.  [00:22:58] [Speaker 8]: And our tenants and the community knows it's safe.  [00:23:01] [Speaker 6]: Why  [00:23:02] [Speaker 4]: are  [00:23:04] [Speaker 8]: and they  [00:23:06] [Speaker 6]: come. People that ride motorcycles.  [00:23:07] [Speaker 5]: Reception?  [00:23:09] [Speaker 8]: I don't know. Yeah.  [00:23:10] [Speaker 6]: People that ride bicycles,  [00:23:12] [Speaker 1]: cyclists.

I don't know the why they're called bikers,  [00:23:23] [Speaker 5]: but  [00:23:24] [Speaker 4]: 1  [00:23:25] [Speaker 3]: That one, definitely not. The bicycle, that kinda makes sense.  [00:23:28] [Speaker 7]: So  [00:23:29] [Speaker 3]: there's still cycles, like, the cycle list because some of them are  [00:23:30] [User]: unicyclists.

[00:23:37] [Speaker 8]: If we don't the entire building, like this. We naturally lease the 1st floor. So that we can program it in the right way. We own this plot right here. Our local strip line burned up about 4 months ago. We don't mind that. We can take that off. But we are gonna talk  [00:23:46] [Speaker 6]: about  [00:23:47] [Speaker 7]: development right now.  [00:23:48] [Speaker 8]: Wow. And,  [00:23:50] [Speaker 6]: we'll have insurance on  [00:23:52] [Speaker 2]: that  [00:23:53] [Speaker 3]: other line? No. It was just conveniently burnt down, and they didn't want it there anyway. So did de duplication. Phase 1. I  [00:24:01] [User]: wonder if they started it to fire intentionally. Sir?  [00:24:04] [Speaker 6]: Tipsy  [00:24:05] [Speaker 7]: move. Oh,  [00:24:07] [Speaker 8]: my god. It's turned red. I hope I don't get a ticket. I hope  [00:24:10] [Speaker 7]: not.  [00:24:11] [Speaker 3]: Oh, if you oh my god. But this is a privilege.  [00:24:14] [Speaker 9]: You're  [00:24:15] [Speaker 3]: privileged to showing,  [00:24:16] [Speaker 6]: dude. I mean, he owns the block, babe.  [00:24:19] [Speaker 5]: Yeah.  [00:24:20] [Speaker 7]: But just  [00:24:22] [Speaker 3]: but all of the places where you can where jaywalking is a thing and where people choose to enforce the law, it's against it's against who and in  [00:24:27] [Speaker 7]: what part of town?  [00:24:29] [Speaker 3]: Just like, you know, just like to mock it like that. It's kinda like, really? No?  [00:24:32] [Speaker 7]: Don't  [00:24:33] [Speaker 6]: know.  [00:24:35] [Speaker 8]: It's just  [00:24:36] [Speaker 5]: crazy.  [00:24:37] [Speaker 7]: I mean, I  [00:24:39] [Speaker 3]: not thinking you did it consciously like that, but just, like,  [00:24:42] [Speaker 4]: I mean, he sounds like an arrogant fucking prick.  [00:24:44] [Speaker 3]: For sure. Yeah.  [00:24:46] [Speaker 7]: No doubt.  [00:24:48] [Speaker 4]: I  [00:24:49] [Speaker 7]: mean, He  [00:24:50] [Speaker 3]: Quicken Loans owns most of Detroit apparently as, if you were Yeah. As Right? I mean, that's why that's what he works for, who he works for, or whatever. But I thought he was saying shit about, like, no outs outside, like, money or, like, I don't even know  [00:25:04] [Speaker 7]: whatever. And then, like,  [00:25:06] [Speaker 3]: all of it's  [00:25:07] [Speaker 7]: fucking  [00:25:09] [Speaker 4]: just bunch  [00:25:10] [Speaker 3]: of bureaucracy bullshit that's  [00:25:12] [User]: hard to understand  [00:25:14] [Speaker 3]: and all these different loopholes.  [00:25:16] [Speaker 8]: We just got through all your pictures.  [00:25:18] [Speaker 7]: I  [00:25:19] [Speaker 4]: Oh.  [00:25:20] [Speaker 8]: Probably not  [00:25:22] [Speaker 9]: the  [00:25:23] [Speaker 3]: best. I hate this one too.  [00:25:25] [Speaker 10]: All the fun  [00:25:26] [Speaker 8]: with a 40 foot wall of flame on both sides.  [00:25:29] [Speaker 9]: It's crazy.  [00:25:30] [Speaker 7]: Firefighting. Or I don't know where for sure, but  [00:25:32] [Speaker 3]: for sure they were they were sure it's in  [00:25:35] [Speaker 7]: California. I mean, there are  [00:25:37] [Speaker 3]: fire there's there's wildfires, like or there's fires. I  [00:25:39] [Speaker 5]: don't know about wild. But  [00:25:41] [Speaker 3]: everywhere a lot of places in the United States.  [00:25:43] [Speaker 7]: But  [00:25:44] [User]: horrible in California, and that's where they were hiring.  [00:25:47] [Speaker 3]: And paying them nothing, pretty  [00:25:49] [Speaker 7]: much.  [00:25:50] [Speaker 6]: I bet that shit's fucking hot. And then I remember, like, I fucking  [00:25:54] [Speaker 4]: I walked by a fucking not walks  [00:25:56] [Speaker 6]: right by it, but, like,  [00:25:57] [Speaker 7]: couple of houses  [00:25:59] [Speaker 4]: or  [00:26:00] [Speaker 6]: a couple  [00:26:01] [Speaker 4]: streets over  [00:26:03] [Speaker 6]: a house that was on fucking fire. Mhmm.  [00:26:05] [Speaker 8]: And I  [00:26:06] [Speaker 6]: wanted to see it because  [00:26:08] [Speaker 4]: that's not something that you see every time. Like, they the firefighters are there. They're fighting fucking fire. And she's was like, I just sat there and watched. She didn't call down. I walked over there. And as I turned the corner, the house is, like, fucking 4 or 5 houses down. As I turned the corner onto their street, like, I could feel the fucking heat from that fucking  [00:26:28] [Speaker 7]: far away.  [00:26:29] [Speaker 4]: Like, that that shit was I don't know. It's fucking big. Serious?  [00:26:32] [Speaker 7]: I know that's a helicopter and fire. I think it's a fire. That was crazy.  [00:26:35] [Speaker 6]: Yeah.  [00:26:36] [Speaker 5]: Wow. It's not in the morning. I will do what they call a firebox. We watch the flames and the air come down.  [00:26:41] [Speaker 6]: I mean, versus the monotony of fucking prison lighting? Fucking call me out.  [00:26:46] [Speaker 8]: Yeah. And I'm but, like, it's crazy though that, like, I  [00:26:50] [Speaker 3]: don't know. I don't know, like, what  [00:26:52] [Speaker 4]: I see it whenever fucking What's that? What was it? Harvey? Hurricane Harvey?  [00:26:56] [Speaker 6]: Fuck you. No. I was at Torrey's in  [00:26:58] [Speaker 4]: they had, like, they dropped fucking huge ass mounds of sand for for to make sandbags  [00:27:04] [Speaker 6]: out of. Mhmm. And  [00:27:06] [Speaker 4]: I was like,  [00:27:07] [Speaker 8]: Yeah.  [00:27:08] [Speaker 7]: Yeah.  [00:27:09] [Speaker 5]: So I imagine it's I wouldn't be too.  [00:27:10] [Speaker 4]: This is, like, when I was, like, fresh off of fucking My 800 milligrams are called mezzanine daily. So, like, I was actually being active and  [00:27:16] [Speaker 7]: awake. So I  [00:27:18] [Speaker 4]: was like, I'm bored. Dude, fuck that. I'm so glad that that the fucking 2 years I had so far were spent how they work because I don't know if I  [00:27:25] [Speaker 5]: fucking  [00:27:26] [Speaker 6]: would've made it. I'm gonna find the because I was  [00:27:28] [Speaker 10]: I  [00:27:29] [Speaker 6]: fucking suck at being bored. I always wanna be, like, doing What's the what are they doing? We  [00:27:34] [Speaker 5]: saved a lot of. Oh,  [00:27:36] [Speaker 7]: Sometimes. The saving pop is all about hungry and hoping.  [00:27:41] [Speaker 3]: They're probably in an end to think they're probably a lot of them are in prison for property crimes. I  [00:27:46] [Speaker 11]: think it's  [00:27:47] [Speaker 5]: Considering you're saving people's  [00:27:49] [Speaker 6]: property.  [00:27:50] [Speaker 4]: A lot of times, though, like, if you have certain crimes, they won't let they won't let you do no extra curricular whatsoever.  [00:27:57] [Speaker 7]: Yeah. I'm all right now.  [00:27:58] [Speaker 9]: I'm sure I could do it.  [00:28:00] [Speaker 7]: It is, like,  [00:28:01] [Speaker 6]: mean going through the STG? Wait.  [00:28:03] [Speaker 7]: Wait. Wait.  [00:28:04] [Speaker 3]: Think she's talking about that actually because Or about it in  [00:28:08] [Speaker 9]: I'm  [00:28:09] [Speaker 10]: not. With  [00:28:10] [Speaker 6]: it.  [00:28:11] [Speaker 5]: If that would be something  [00:28:12] [Speaker 7]: but that's not what happened.  [00:28:14] [Speaker 5]: 9 times out of 10. You're not going to be a firefighter.  [00:28:16] [Speaker 3]: That sucks. So they do this while they're in prison and then once they're on parole they don't have any chance of becoming a firefighter? Even with this, like, actual, like, experience.  [00:28:24] [Speaker 6]: That's that's  [00:28:25] [Speaker 9]: scary.  [00:28:26] [Speaker 3]: That's fucked up. That's crazy. And then if like, so then why are y'all doing the work? Why don't the firefighters who are allowed to become firefighters able to do it? Oh, I  [00:28:34] [Speaker 7]: know. Because you have to pay them. Yeah.  [00:28:37] [Speaker 9]: Yeah.  [00:28:38] [Speaker 3]: But they they wouldn't be firefighters. I don't be firefighters. Right? But, no, they're not letting them because then they have to pay them.  [00:28:44] [Speaker 9]: That's  [00:28:45] [Speaker 4]: fucked up. Do you  [00:28:46] [Speaker 10]: do  [00:28:47] [Speaker 9]: firefighters  [00:28:48] [User]: get paid an extra for, like,  [00:28:49] [User]: fucking  [00:28:50] [Speaker 5]: They don't get paid 15¢ an  [00:28:51] [Speaker 12]: hour.  [00:28:52] [Speaker 6]: Well, yeah. I mean Or they or definitely a lot more than a  [00:28:54] [Speaker 4]: fucking inmate would get paid, but, like, I'm talking about, like, do they get like, say, say, there's a fire in the wild fire. If  [00:29:00] [User]: we're responding to a wild  [00:29:01] [Speaker 9]: I  [00:29:03] [Speaker 3]: have no idea. I don't know about  [00:29:05] [Speaker 12]: that. Or for, like, multiple for,  [00:29:07] [Speaker 4]: like do they get it's not a com it's obviously not a commission based fucking job, but, like, do they get paid for having more work? Like, you know, workload, like, type of shit. Like, on  [00:29:12] [Speaker 7]: the on the No. I don't think  [00:29:14] [Speaker 11]: so.  [00:29:15] [Speaker 3]: I don't think so. I think that, like, if you sign up in California to be a firefighter, you just know that firefighting and wildfires are gonna be a  [00:29:20] [Speaker 12]: thing. Yeah. But  [00:29:21] [Speaker 3]: and but they do, like, shifts where you have 3 days on and you just, like, sleep and never  [00:29:25] [Speaker 5]: you go out and then  [00:29:26] [User]: So you get paid the same no matter what, but they get paid pretty good.  [00:29:29] [Speaker 4]: I remember, doing community service at the fucking Bulverde fire station.  [00:29:32] [Speaker 9]: Like,  [00:29:34] [Speaker 4]: that was, like, the coolest fucking community service I ever did. Like, literally, all I did was, like, wash the guy's trucks.  [00:29:39] [Speaker 9]: Mhmm.  [00:29:40] [Speaker 6]: Fucking,  [00:29:41] [Speaker 4]: like, alright  [00:29:42] [Speaker 9]: If  [00:29:43] [Speaker 4]: you're gonna be here all day, man, fuck you, if you wanna just fucking take a nap or whatever, fucking go for  [00:29:50] [Speaker 0]: Oh, yeah. But I actually got a job. Working with Google after about community service. I didn't become a fire for me. Yeah. What's  [00:29:56] [Speaker 1]: that? Oh my god. What's going on here? I don't know what's going on though.  [00:30:00] [User]: Oh. Can  [00:30:01] [Speaker 1]: you still connect it to your Bluetooth speaker?  [00:30:04] [User]: Who's that? Oh, What? Yeah. I don't know what happened there. I think it's, like,  [00:30:08] [Speaker 1]: Do we still have any, broken bones useless  [00:30:11] [User]: glass? Yeah.  [00:30:12] [Speaker 1]: Probably.

Let me give you one more example. The case of Herbert Hoover. This is to show that it's not just a matter of cycle history being used against radicals and rebels. It could also be used against conservatives. Herbert Hoover a case study of Herbert Hoover appears in James David Barber's book on the presidential character. Barbara's treatment the active negative president, by the way, is one who experiences severe deprivation in childhood and who subsequently try to bring his environment a sense of self worth to achievement and a search for power over others. Well, according to Barbara Hoover, suffered from fatal flaw of character that caused him to discard an earlier flexibility for a latter day self defeating rigidity. The early hoover was a pragmatic miracle work a humanitarian, a man who brought aid and food to the starving people of Europe in the midst of World War 1 and right afterwards. But Barbara has this problem. How could this Herbert Hoover, the pragmatic miracle worker who did all these good things, why would he freeze an opposition to relief for jobless Americans? That is the same Herbert Hoover when he became president of the United States refused to give aid to workers in the midst of the depression. They tells us that Hoover was an emotionally blocked man with an unhappy childhood that left him very emotionally blocked. Taciturn, cumulus, reserve and seldom capable of crying. In fact, Hoopa had a marriage which was very emotionally attached to in which he was very emotionally attached to his wife the little evidence that Barbara offers seems to contradict this picture of of this taciturn humanist fellow who could express on on one occasion, we when we we threaten to fight a heckler in the 1938 campaign, Bob noted that that doesn't seem like an emotionally blocked fellow. Hoover could cry. Bar day Barbara cites 2 instances when he was moved to tears in public. I don't know how many times that an emotionally address emotively blocked president is expected to cry in public. Must be found out years ago, Hoover was profoundly moved both emotion emotionally into action when visited in the White House by 3 children who were pleading to have their unemployed father released from jail. And by the way, the only contemporary testimony barber office of a of one of Hoover's contemporaries is Eugene Lyons. And he said and this is what Lyons says about Hoover's Hoover was not cold, but, quote, a sensitive saw hearted person who craves affection, enjoys continual company, and suffers under the swings of the Unquote. Well, what I'm saying in sum is that the data that Barbara offers on Hoover's life are not only selective and sketchy, but they lend themselves to a contrary interpretation. Barbara failed to make a convincing case that the trace he ascribes to Hoover are the dominant components of his character or are endowed with the significance that Barbara attributes to them. The consequences that one comes away with the feeling and we are left asking, how does he know that about Hoofa? Finally, and most important, give us the things said about Hoover's personality are true, they do not seem to have much explanatory power when applied to his public behavior, and they don't explain why Hoover acted with such self rigidity. And in fact, I'm going to give you an alternative interpretation. That is in place of the psychological Hoover I will give you the political hoover. How could Hoover  [00:11:21] User: Venezuela's ranking for more protests today after Sunday's presidential elections.  [00:11:25] Speaker 1: Earlier this year, Venezuela had a pretty major election. On July 20  [00:11:30] Speaker 2: over 10,000,000 people went to the polls in a contest to decide whether to elect the incumbent, Nicolas Maduro, the challenger, Edmundo Gonzales, or one of the 8 other opposition candidates. And then we saw a very familiar scene.  [00:11:50] User: Of course, the accusations of fraud,  [00:11:52] Speaker 1: we saw  [00:11:53] Speaker 2: victory in quotation marks. Electoral authorities, which are heavily controlled by  [00:12:00] Speaker 3: the government.  [00:12:01] Speaker 4: Voluntary president Nicolas Maduro, immoral criminal dictator that he  [00:12:04] Speaker 1: is.  [00:12:05] Speaker 4: Sending on to  [00:12:06] Speaker 2: power. Undemocratic attempt to repress political participation  [00:12:09] Speaker 3: It was clear from the start this would not be  [00:12:11] User: a warfare.  [00:12:12] Speaker 3: Election.  [00:12:13] Speaker 2: Western media has a particular way of talking about foreign elections, and let's call them a attempted leadership changes in other countries. And this video, I want to really zoom in on that. I wanna dig deep into the story of foreign elections were served here in the US and how that reporting affects the way we understand the world outside our  [00:12:31] Speaker 4: country.  [00:12:32] Speaker 2: Specifically when it comes to the reporting of our most important outputs, The New York Times.  [00:12:38] Speaker 3: So  [00:12:39] Speaker 1: the new  [00:12:40] Speaker 2: York Times is an extremely important message for not all Its tagline is all the news that's fit to print.

But, you know, it gets embarrassing when the applause you get before you speak are longer than the applause you get after  [00:02:00] Speaker 1: these, I'm  [00:02:01] Speaker 3: gonna talk about the US globalism. I'm one of those people who believes that US foreign policy is not stupid or confused but it's very rational and it's very consistent. The history of US policy especially after World War 2, but even before, is the history of bloody repressive interventions.  [00:02:24] Speaker 0: Click in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Syria, Indonesia under Seccano, Greece, twice, Argentina, twice, Haiti, Bolivia, and other countries. It's a very incomplete list. Those are the ones I wrote down on the plane, just come to my head. And replace them in each case with pro capitalist military regimes that open up their markets resources, and cheap labor by cheap labor, I mean unorganized labor. I mean, underpaid labor. I mean, labor that's intimidated  [00:02:55] Speaker 1: on terms that are completely favorable to the investors. US has been active in covert action and proxy mercenary wars against popular revolutionary governments in Cuba, Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Portugal, South Yemen, Nicaragua, Cambodia, East Timor, Western Sahara, and elsewhere, another incomplete list. Against reformist governments in Egypt, Lebanon, Peru, Iran under Mossadegh, Syria, Zaire, Jamaica, the Fiji Islands, Afghanistan, US forces with direct aggression and invasion have attacked just in recent years in the last few decades Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, North Korea, Laos, either with direct total invasion or aerial attack or both. North Korea, Laos, Cambodia, Yugoslavia, Lebanon, Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Libya, Iraq twice, Somalia, Estimated 10,000 people killed in Somalia. You didn't hear about that 10,000, did you? When they did black Hawk Down and they showed those 28 American boys killed, 28 who should have never been there, and we support our troops. We wanna take them and bring them home. That's the real support. You saw that, all that fighting and all that. They didn't tell you that 10,000 Somalians were killed by US jets and and missiles and whatever else. 100 of 1,000 have been killed in Iraq. 10 of thousands died every week. All through the 12 years of sanctions. I visited Iraq in in 99. When I was there, the bombings the bombings didn't start again. The bombings never stopped. The bombings were going on all through those 12 years. 2 or 3 times a week, somebody were getting killed. And the short 7 days I was in Iraq in in November 2000 a school was hit and 4 students were badly injured and 2 teachers were killed just in the week I was there by American bombs and that stuff kept going on. 3,000,000 were killed in Vietnam. 300,000 Vietnamese are still missing in action. We talk about our missing in action. Vietnam was worth 1200 now. Where are they? Where where could they be? They have 300,000 missing blown to pieces, gone, whatever. A half a 1000000 in Leo's were killed, and that's not the only victims. There's the victims who survive. They're the victims with shattered bodies, with shattered spirits and minds. They're the victims who lost everything. Who who spent a lifetime trying to recover from that. 300,000 killed in East Timor by that deranged murder machine known as the Indonesian army trained, equipped, paid, and advised by the Pentagon the CIA, and the US National Security State. 80,000 killed in El Salvador. Finally acknowledged, finally, and The New York Times acknowledged 30 years later, acknowledged that 205,000 were killed in Guatemala And the president, our peerless leader at that time, slime bag built Clinton, goes down and says, I apologize. Oh, okay. I apologize. That makes it all okay now. 205,000 killed by death squads by extermination programs, 600 Mayan villages 600 of these villages, every man, woman, and child in them, killed by Rios Mont, general Rios Mont, protege, of the school of the Americas, protege of the CIA. Over 1,000,000 people killed in Mozambique I'm big. We never heard a word about this in the media. Because it was a CIA war. Over 2,000,000 killed in Angola and a war that went on for 30 years, which shouldn't have to go on at all except that you need Ta was equipped and financed by the US. All through the Middle East all through the Middle East, popular movements, workers' movements, unions, student movements, farmer collectives, all of them, the destroyed, battered down, in Turkey, in Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, that obscenely filthy rich corrupt family wouldn't last 3 weeks if they didn't  [00:09:00] Speaker 2: have guns behind  [00:09:01] Speaker 1: them. People of Saudi Arabia are ready to get rid of them. And we could go on. 21 countries in Africa have had enormous amounts of US arms brides, all of this to put in the most retrograde, repressive, and corrupt rulers to destroy every popular movement, every democratic movement that emerged These people are perfectly capable of democracy. These people are perfectly capable of viable production. These people are perfectly capable of organizing their markets and their labor. They're perfectly capable. They aren't allowed to do it. Because because of this kind of destruction. The destruction of the economic infrastructure the impoverished of the people, the destruction of their future. Kill the future of a nation too. And anyone who dares to oppose it or question it is called a rogue state. Now there's no rogue state There's no terrorist movement. There's no axis of Evil. There's no communist state that has this kind of record. There's no communist red blood menace, you know, say what you want, Stalinist state. That has anything like this record of aggression, and destruction and murder and violation of international law. That just isn't. And I say the American people don't know it. All of this, by the way, is a matter of public record. It's not like I got some secret documents that just came into my hands that no one else has seen. It's all a matter of public record. But but, of course, there's some parts of the public record that get blasted across the media, and there are other parts of it that are thoroughly suppressed. Now it's not enough to bemoan or denounce this. We also have to explain it. We have to explain why Why is this happening? We will not convince outcome patriots  [00:11:00] of the  [00:11:01] Speaker 1: wrong nature of this kind of policy unless we discuss the real intent and interest behind such policy. As long as they believe that this is being done to protect them from some threats out there, They will go along with it. They don't care if their leaders are rough, They don't care if their leaders violate international law. They want them to violate international law. They want them to act like thugs and gangsters. They want them to be tough and brutal and total and decisive. That's called  [00:11:30] Speaker 2: straw leadership,  [00:11:31] Speaker 1: strong defense. And when they are afraid, and that is what our leadership has done, is to conjure up fears that there's people out there gonna get us. And for a  [00:11:39] Speaker 2: long  [00:11:40] Speaker 1: time, it was the communist menace. The communist the communists are gonna get you. It's all because of communist. We have to do this. We have to support dictators because we gotta stop those communists. But a lot of these interventions came way before communism, and a lot more of them happening more frequently, more bloodily after communism. So it wasn't communism. That was one of the excuses. That was one of the bugaboo's that they raised up. That was one of the fears they conjured up so that people will rally around the flag and will do what the leaders want. And we've got to speak to that fear and say, you have a false fear There are things you really should be afraid of and you're not afraid of it. Like poisoning the environment, like going and killing all these people, like putting you to and stop fearing some little country. One year it's Noriega, next year it's Milosevic, the next year it's Gaddafi, the next year it's the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. The next year, Saddam Hussein. Remember Gaddafi? I remember 19 eighties. In the 19 eighties, I was going around lecturing, and suddenly I hear people saying to me, Gaddafi. Gaddafi. Everybody was Gaddafi. Gaddafi. What about Gaddafi? Gaddafi. Gaddafi. Gaddafi go and get your mama. Gaddafi. Mister  [00:13:00] Speaker 2: Gaddafi. I  [00:13:01] Speaker 1: said, what Gaddafi?  [00:13:02] Speaker 2: What? 2 months  [00:13:03] Speaker 1: ago, you couldn't have found Libya on the map. Today, you can that  [00:13:05] Speaker 2: this  [00:13:06] Speaker 1: guy, head of a country of 3,000,000 people, with an army of 50,000 about the size of the LAPD, is a moral threat to the  [00:13:10] Speaker 2: safety  [00:13:11] Speaker 1: of the United States of America, to the national security, And what was Gaddafi's real sin? I'll tell you what his real sin was because that policy wasn't stupid when they targeted Gaddafi. Gaddafi, and their animosity toward him is a very legitimate one. Here's what Gaddafi did. Gaddafi took a country that had a social structure like Saudi Arabia where a few obscenely rich families ran the whole thing, got all the money from the oil, and the massive people will pour And what he did is he kicked those families out. He  [00:13:40] Speaker 2: and  [00:13:41] Speaker 1: his colonel's rebellion and he started a forestation program he planted millions of trees. He started health programs. Education school programs for the first time in the history the ordinary Libyans could go to school. What he was doing, and he nationalized the oil industry. And he took the Oh, he took Earnings He took the earnings from the oil industry. He still sold it to to the western markets are they gonna do with it? They they can't drink it? They can't eat it? Should they have? More than half to sell it. To the west. But they were getting the cut on it. And that money is what he used and he gave that back to the people. And that's not what they like. Because the difference between the half and the have not I mean, the truth is the conflict between the haves and the  [00:14:30] Speaker 2: have  [00:14:31] Speaker 1: nots the haves are really the have at alls. They want it all, and they don't want to give a little bit here and a little there. US government since World War 2 has given away some $300,000,000,000 in military aid. Just think with 300,000,000,000 that could solve all the budgetary crises of all the states in the union right now. Just that amount, aid, to train, equip, and subsidize some 2,500,000 troops and internal security forces in more than 80  [00:15:00] Speaker 2: countries not to  [00:15:01] Speaker 1: defend these nations from outside invasion, but to protect ruling oligarchs and multi national corporate investors from the dangers of domestic anti capitalist insurgency. How do we know that's true? Well, by observing For instance, that with very few exceptions, there's no evidence that these various regimes have ever been threatened by attack from neighboring countries. So why are they building up these military forces? Why are they building up these security and police and paramilitary forces? It's not to make war or defend themselves from another country that's gonna make war on them. It's to make war on their own people, to make war on their own working people. That's why. To protect those countries to make the world safe for the fortune 500.  [00:16:00] Speaker 0: Military and security forces and death squads in the various countries have been used repeatedly to destroy popular reformist movement and insurgencies that advocate some kind of egalitarian redistribution of the resources of the society. So the struggle really is between those who think that the land the labor, the natural resources, the markets, the technology, and the capital of the world in every country are there for the capital accumulation  [00:16:30] Speaker 1: all those things are there for the needs and the social betterment of the many. That's the basic struggle that goes on. The designated enemy the demonized enemy, pumped up by the media obligingly following the line, the White House or the Pentagon puts out, the designated enemy can be a reformist, populous military government as in Panama under Tortillo, and even under Noriega. Or as in Egypt under NASA, Peru under Velasco, Portugal after Salazar, when the army officers took over, it could be a Christian social government as in Nicaragua under the Sandinistas. It could be a social democracy popular front government as in Chile under allende or Jamaica under Michael Manley or Greece under Papandreo the Dominican Republic under Wambush, It could be a Marxist Leninist government as in Cuba, Vietnam, and North Korea. An Islamic revolutionary order as in Libya under Gaddafi, or even a conservative militarist regime as in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. In 1907, this is what Woodrow Wilson said. 19 0 7. This was I don't even think he was yet governor of New Jersey. Well, he certainly wasn't president. Maybe he was governor. He was a political science professor. And president of Princeton for a while, and then and then, governor of New Jersey and then president of the United States. In 1907, Woodrow Wilson noted the role that's played by the capitalist state on behalf of private Capital. I quote him. Since trade ignores national boundaries, and the manufacturer insists on having the world as a market,  [00:18:00] User: Okay. Well, whatever you want. I was gonna I'll order right now if you want me to pay for it. I don't care.  [00:18:05] Speaker 1: The flag of his nation must follow him, and the doors of the nation's which are closed against him must be battered down. Concessions obtained by financier's must be safeguarded by ministers of state. Now you hear that? As a bourgeois college professor, president of the United States, If I just read that statement and I said if I said the financier is are serviced by the ministers of state, The ministers of state have to safeguard the financiers. You know what people say? Oh, you're Marxists. You're Marx. That's Marxist. You know? I hear I hear that. I always hear that all the time when I was when I was just getting myself radical used to hear that. I'd say things like, I'd say, you know, I think racism is actually  [00:18:40] Speaker 0: Not the right of the worker who has an entitlement in the labor that he invest. I said, oh, that's Marx. That's Marx. Get this all the time. I say, you know, I don't think US policy is so innocent We're out there helping the finding. Oh, that's Marx, they say all the time. And I say, boy, this guy, Mark's, was really something. You know, here I am am. I'm knocking myself out trying to make an analysis every time I come up with something, they give him the credit.  [00:19:00] Speaker 1: something. That wasn't Mark. That wasn't perenti. That was reality. That's what it was. And reality happens to be Marxist. So let's repeat that sentence and go on. Woodrow Wilson is talking. Concessions obtained by financers must be safeguarded by ministers of state even if the sovereignty of unwilling nations be outraged in the process. Colonies must be obtained or planted in order that no useful corner of the world may be overlooked or left unused. Now that does sound like, March, the manifesto, the same wording he says, capitalism goes into every corner of the world to recreate it in its own image and put it to use for its capital accumulation process. Interesting. Sometimes the flag will go in before the dollars get there. And that's to create new opportunities. For instance, in 1919 in Haiti, the people started a popular rebellion and revolution They actually built a popular militia to try to get the land back from the land owners to try to get the big companies out of there and all that, The US declared political instability. They have certain code words, you know, they use, political instability. Undemocratic forces. We got a defendant. Political and instability and, of course, racism gets used very handily here. You say At least, though, brown people in this little island have to learn self governance. So we will have to go down and show them and and at least bring law and order and stability back. So they went down just just to just take care of that. And they stayed a mere 19 years and they killed 18,000 Haitians. And they also kicked out the French German, and British companies, and US companies came in. You see, capitalism not only fights the class war against its own laboring class, capital formations will often fight against each other and against other national capital formations. And, of course, the people pick up the tab on that too. You go Yugoslavia is a great case in point. I have a book there called to Kill a Nation. Got any more copies of it? Good. See, here comes the infomercial now with There it is. Okay. Yugoslavia was tolerated quite some time as a breakaway country from the eastern block of nation, so called block of nations. But after 1990, the US saw no reason to tolerate its existence anymore. I mean, here was a country, a rather large country right in Central Europe which was not which was not going the way of free market reforms as was happening in in Russia, the Ukraine, Poland, and all over. They were not doing that usual thing. They were not at first, they weren't. Yugoslavia had an economy that was 80 percent. State owned still. Yugoslavia had a high standard of living and a high degree of economic equality, Anybody could go to school to the highest level they want. And medical care was free. Yugoslavia showed no interest in joining European Union no interest at all in joining NATO, It had a productive industrial base a successful auto industry, 80% of the Yugoslav auto market was sold by the YUGO. It had construction firms that competed quite successfully throughout even in Western have Now when you destroy all that, you of course increase the value of your own capital. If I destroy your firms, destroy the auto industry, I increase the value of my auto industry. I destroy your agricultural base, I increase the value and open market opportunities for my agricultural base. And that's exactly what happened. German and US agencies supported every retrograde secessionist, and reactionary ethnic nationalists in Bosnia and Croatia, and in Kosovo, And today, been broken up into a cluster of little right wing republics where everything is privatized everything's been deregulated, sold off to private investors at garage sale prices. That's the public capital of the people's labor is now given away to private investors, where the media have been taken over by a rich private investors or conservatives. Pension funds have been plundered and disappeared Public services have been shredded. I was just in Belgrade, last March, And, I was with a friend, and she said, well, I'm gonna meet you later. It was a Saturday. I'm gonna meet you later but I'm I'm going to a doctor's appointment. Said, what do you mean? It's 7 o'clock Saturday night you're gonna see a doctor? Who would see the doctor at 7 o'clock? He says, oh, here in in Yugoslavia, the doctors will see you anytime you want because they're so desperate for patients. The public health services have broken down So people literally without, unless you can pay, are literally without services And 7 was a convenient time for her. And then the doctor said, okay. Sure. There's inflation in Yugoslavia now. There's unemployment, poverty, suicide, prostitution. All of this has skyrocketed. And, we hear next to nothing about it in the press. It's a free market paradise It has been brought into the fold of the west. That's Yugoslavia today. And, unfortunately, there were too many people on the left who supported that war and swallowed swallowed the official line. They swallowed the mass media line right down their throat. They thought they were fighting rape. Thought they were fighting a demon called Milosevic, and they didn't. And they were just ill informed and taken in. It's much too bad. And I'm including some very notable notable progressive speakers who swallowed that line. Including one who calls himself a pacifist. Okay. Now some critics say Well, economic factors are not the motive behind intervention. Because the intervention often costs more than the investment that the US has there. For instance, in the Philippines, in the Philippines, the US has spent something like $7,000,000,000 in aid. In the Philippines over the last 30, 40 years to protect the US investment that's only about 3,000,000,000 So it can't be economical. It's uneconomical. Spending £7,000,000,000 to protect £3,000,000,000 You know, Boston Bevelin answered this question over a 100 years ago. He said, what you're forgetting about the Philippines, but I'll bring him in now as a voice. What you're forgetting is that the people who paid the 7,000,000,000 and the people who have the 3,000,000,000 are them. And they'll spend $7 of your money to protect $3 of the They'll spend $20, 50, a $100 of your money just to protect $1 of their money. In fact, when it comes to protecting their money, your money is no object. Furthermore, it's not just to protect direct investments. It's to protect that whole global system. Is to destroy and suppress any country that tries an alternative self defining self developing system that tries to get out from under that that enormous system. So it's not just direct investment. The 2 most dramatic examples of US and on military direct military intervention, there was very little US money involved. In Soviet Russia in 1919, 1920 1, most of the capital was British and French.  [00:22:50] Speaker 2: I am very privileged to introduce our main speaker. Doctor Michael Ferrani.

Yes. K. 50  [00:00:02] Speaker 1: multibillionaires, and the rest of us will be 260 In Serbia and Bosnia, the last remaining radio station was a Serbian station. It was a distant station. It was critical in NATO. Critical of Western policy. It was the last station in all of Bos and Herzegovina. And the article in The New York Times to see the reporter committing these mental gymnastics to explain why the NATO peacekeepers, I e, Gestapo troops, went in and closed the station down. Why that was a step toward more pluralistic democracy? That this was a marvelous thing to watch him do these gyrations, you know, down this column. Yugoslavia, before the NATO bombings, before this war began, before that, and you go to Africa every opposition newspaper, every opposition political party had its own newspaper, its own radio station. That's right. 20 of them. You know, this today. And any other leader in Europe.  [00:01:02] Speaker 1: She told me that she asked the US ambassador, what do you want from us? In 1992, another blow was delivered against 1 remained of Yugoslavia, international sanctions, the The civilian population is the primary target of sanctions. That was that's what we To justify this matter to mention have held for more than 3 centuries. Most of the same is true of Sergality in Bosnia. And and so it disturbed the trying to hold on to their own. The US has punished one side in this war and unfairly, Boyd says. It has supported the legitimacy of the leadership in the Bosnian its its  [00:01:45] Speaker 2: maker. Let's see.

Why were the Serbs targeted for demonization?  [00:02:00] Speaker 3: Of Cohen East.  [00:02:01] Speaker 1: When he decided that the 96 election And, hey, Mike. We should go in.

Don't forget to get all this, you know, that, like, taken care of in that dark  [00:02:12] User: Well, there's something hanging out of the door, I think, or something. Okay. Yeah. Oh, duh. Alright. Be careful. Believe me right now. As soon as you get that done? That's okay. Okay. You do. I love you too. Be careful.

[00:02:44] Speaker 0: Surrendered or dropped there arms and come up. They just shot them. Shot them dead. There were forced execution Bonds are being used. He said, are you trusting Serbian sources? I said, which which sources are you trusting? You're trusting Bill Clinton's sources? Oh, Bill Clinton wouldn't lie to us, would he? They us. It turns out they are using cluster bomb It turns out they are using depleted uranium. Our own government now says it. You trust their stories? Do you remember the 500 premature babe that the Iraqis supposedly ripped from incubators in Kuwait? The throwing a  [00:03:21] Speaker 1: of the poor victims whose little premature baby was in there, It turned out the story was a total fabrication. 5 100 premature babies and incubators It turns out in all of LA County, there's not more than 50 incubators. Half of them are not being used at any one time. Did Kuwait specialize in premature births? Instead of saying we shouldn't say, wait a minute. Wait a minute. What is this story about? What's going on here? It was repainted again and again. I don't know any war where rapes are not committed is not to dismiss such awful things as rapes. 2 rapes is 2 rapes too many? But the San Francisco Chronicle had a headline that said rape just just just to Lisa, rape is an official serve policy. Kosovo refugees say. Only know about official policy. And you read down 2 columns, and finally you get the OSCE official says there have been there have been owned. The rates have only numbered in the dozens, very few dozens as a matter of fact. Very few dozens of rapes. That's not an official policy. Oh, if Bill Clinton is looking to stop very few dozens of race, well, that's that's a slow, about 2 months in Washington. DC. He could start much closer to home. He could concentrate on Capitol Hill as a matter of fact or even closer. It's so touching to see our leaders finally, finally concerned about rape It is so, so touching, but it's so odd that they've gotta look so far away go fight this crime. Go forth and write a Bosnian Serb commander was calling saying an official policy, and the Bosnian Serb Armed Forces, which numbers only about 30,000 men numbered than was accused of having rape from 25 to 1 1,000 Muslim women There's an army that's involved in in in in bitter desperate military we  [00:04:56] Speaker 2: should have said,  [00:04:57] Speaker 1: wait a minute. What's going on here? What are these stories about? The serve can Serbian commander. They never were able to trace that. They traced it back to Rooter Finn. Right? That's boasts to about how it has convinced much of the progressive in America that there's genocide and ethnic cleansing and mass rape and all of this is going on. And when they were questioned about the unverifiable, unconfirmed reports, they said, our goal is public relations. We're not here to get confirmation, and we achieved our goal There was the answer blown away. The Serbs were attacked the Serbs. And that's when the Serbs went in and attacked, and that's when you had the worst the worst single  [00:05:41] Speaker 2: act  [00:05:42] Speaker 1: And and let's say, so recently, a mass forced explosion And that  [00:05:45] Speaker 2: was  [00:05:46] Speaker 1: 600,000 served between 1991, 95, but especially in 95 from cryo, 200,000 of them. The serve defenses were broken by NATO bombs and all that and the Croatian army came through 200,000 Serb. Those who get away alive, left left the country. It turns out that that massacre in Sarajevo market As the story was leaked out in French television that the bomb. David Owen? Who worked as an international negotiator with Cyrus Vance, Cyrus Vance, in his book, Oracle Odecey, page 26 2, himself admits that the NATO powers knew all along it was a Muslim bomb, and the Serb did not commit that act. When the KLA took over the casualties of a year fighting, which had been 800, both sides, counting both sides, including this to could over. It jumped suddenly to 2,000. When we called the San Francisco Chronicle Bureau Chief, we said, how did it jump from 800 to 2,000 one day? He said, 2,000 cattle people who are fighting. That's not that's a And now, of course, we have a massive reaction. By the way, the fighting on the ground with KLA and the serfs have been gone. Last week, Quoted in USA Today said they all looked so well fed. They have Nike shoes. I don't know, and the Nike clothes and stuff. How does that happen? They came out in their tractors, in their trucks, and in their cars. These people should not have been driven from 0 5. Their, villages. Let me point out something about the eczema cleansing. 1945, the non Albanian population of Kosovo was about 50%. Between 1945 and 1998. Albanians were coming across the border in substantial numbers, circle being driven off their lands and off their farms. There were repeated requests by Serbians to Tito himself Croatian The ship came by 1998, 1999. Population the Albanian population in Kosovo was about 75%. Although the media keeps reporting 90%. The other 25% was made what we call gypsies, and the others being Turks. Macedonians went to Abrams and a variety of other people. We also see how the leader of the country has deemed demonized when he is targeted by US policy, Gaddafi of Libya. Whose actual whose actual sin was to on things like reforestation, and health and education in clinics rather than giving it all to the people in column a.

[00:02:30] Speaker 3: Oh, how do  [00:02:31] User: you how do you know if these are semi  [00:02:33] Speaker 4: bolts?  [00:02:34] Speaker 1: So why is it vibrating?  [00:02:36] Speaker 2: Again? It was vibrating because we're It's fine.  [00:02:39] Speaker 1: Oh, so  [00:02:41] User: Hi. It's Donator. Birthdays. Oh, wait. No.  [00:02:43] Speaker 4: K.  [00:02:44] Speaker 3: You doing?

[00:03:06] User: My name is Scott.  [00:03:07] Speaker 1: Not always. Hi. Hi. I'm a weirdo  [00:03:10] Speaker 4: to  [00:03:11] Speaker 1: wait. Hi. Okay. We're gonna fuck you.  [00:03:14] Speaker 4: Okay.  [00:03:15] Speaker 2: Mhmm.  [00:03:16] Speaker 0: So we'll sit together. Oh, the gray? No. That's the color. And the gray is the color too. Just a moment. I was just on my phone. This one, sir. All kinds of covers. Did  [00:03:24] Speaker 1: they take the stuff?  [00:03:25] Speaker 0: Ban?  [00:03:26] Speaker 2: But that's because there is also colors and lots  [00:03:29] Speaker 0: This box only came with 2 colors. Right. He's just a signifier for, like,  [00:03:33] Speaker 1: high above  [00:03:34] Speaker 0: the negative. That's usually, like, the the difference in water colors in one of the box of that.  [00:03:39] Speaker 1: Mhmm. How  [00:03:41] User: the fuck wouldn't shouldn't it just be red and black?  [00:03:43] Speaker 1: Why would Well, like, some some circuits have more than 2 wires. Like like, your blinkers have 3 wires running to a ground and then one for the flashes and one for the brake, one for the parking lights.  [00:03:49] User: So the negative is just red and then the other one No.  [00:03:52] Speaker 1: It's negative is black. Okay. Typically,  [00:03:54] User: Okay. They're gonna  [00:03:55] Speaker 1: But some circuits have different different colored wires Like, some circuits are one white wire, one black wire in that situation. Yeah. The white is black is the black is native. Yeah. And then sometimes they have a black and brown  [00:04:01] User: So if you got that box, it's only blue and orange. This one is somebody  [00:04:05] Speaker 1: Whichever one you want because this doesn't determine the the what's on the wire.  [00:04:09] Speaker 2: Well, maybe you just  [00:04:11] User: This is  [00:04:12] Speaker 1: just a connector.  [00:04:13] User: I know. I get that part. You're just saying it's, like, to differentiate for yourself. Yeah.  [00:04:17] Speaker 3: By when they  [00:04:19] User: just make at least one of them lock, and then use whatever color they want for the other ones, I guess?  [00:04:23] Speaker 0: Looks like a black connector like these. And you have to you have to, like, crimp them. Yeah. So when you fucking those are things apart. You have to fucking cut them and shit. Yeah. They performed the same test. Joining wire together. Awesome. This is Oh, this is burnout? Yeah.  [00:04:36] Speaker 1: It's so sad.  [00:04:38] Speaker 0: And  [00:04:39] Speaker 1: the white  [00:04:40] Speaker 0: thought  [00:04:41] Speaker 1: No. I'm  [00:04:42] User: not. The metaly thing medley? Yeah. That's metal  [00:04:44] Speaker 1: things.  [00:04:46] User: There we go. Stop it. Nosey. You nosy doggy. Oh, what's this mean? You ever made a drink?  [00:04:51] Speaker 1: Oh,  [00:04:53] User: No. You don't have to go get  [00:04:54] Speaker 1: him.  [00:04:55] User: That's so cool.  [00:04:56] Speaker 0: So I'm seated. I'm feeling. Go right down. I think so. Well, I  [00:05:01] Speaker 1: woke up really late, so hope on. Let me think about this. Mean, I think I will fed them well, I know for sure I fed them when I woke up after my nap. That was really late, so I'm trying to remember I fed them, before that. Wanna say yes, but it's  [00:05:11] Speaker 0: a  [00:05:12] Speaker 1: voluntary. No. I think it said that.  [00:05:14] Speaker 2: I figured if you got there, Yeah.  [00:05:16] User: I did I know what I'm saying. I know I fed them, but I might have only fed them the one time after my nap. So just once after or just once really late.  [00:05:22] Speaker 1: Seems like he's iron.  [00:05:24] Speaker 2: But then again,  [00:05:26] Speaker 1: he  [00:05:27] Speaker 2: lies  [00:05:28] Speaker 1: in. Yeah. So I don't know. But  [00:05:30] User: don't know. I guess I'll feed them anyways. You hungry?  [00:05:33] Speaker 1: I  [00:05:34] User: hungry? About food.  [00:05:36] Speaker 1: And  [00:05:37] User: then he passed you so I could get his full. Could you please? Oh, shit. Let's about something  [00:05:41] Speaker 1: happening.  [00:05:43] User: Ruin it.

That's just my  [00:06:26] User: you  [00:06:27] Speaker 1: could use it, of course. It  [00:06:28] Speaker 2: just was cool.  [00:06:30] User: Could be just familiar with it because it's worse.  [00:06:32] Speaker 1: Oh,  [00:06:33] Speaker 2: I used to have one like this, but Those stickers. When my head's warm, like, my whole body's hot.  [00:06:38] Speaker 1: Well, I guess  [00:06:39] User: the one that says Subaru on it, is it just Subaru stuff in there?  [00:06:42] Speaker 2: For the most part. Okay.

[00:06:49] Speaker 1: I didn't  [00:06:50] User: seem like it was  [00:06:51] Speaker 1: just  [00:06:52] Speaker 2: It's it's basically all metric. Right. Right. Oh, anything in here in this card is metric. What's  [00:06:58] User: that mean?  [00:06:59] Speaker 2: The  [00:07:00] Speaker 1: it's  [00:07:01] Speaker 2: weird, nuts and bolts have finer threads typically. Standard or the lower imperial measurements have have a side side of thirds.  [00:07:06] Speaker 1: Yeah. But are these  [00:07:08] User: side just extra  [00:07:09] Speaker 1: stuff  [00:07:10] User: They, like,  [00:07:11] Speaker 2: Like, yeah. They're definitely extra because, like, if they were necessarily, they could be And I don't know  [00:07:16] Speaker 1: if this is in here. So we kinda  [00:07:20] User: checked my gym's  [00:07:22] Speaker 1: My rhinestones  [00:07:23] Speaker 0: It's like, what's the health? Weird. This isn't  [00:07:25] Speaker 1: know what that  [00:07:26] Speaker 0: is? Yeah. It's to measure the space between your base  [00:07:29] Speaker 1: That is what is that one? How does that go to? That is a part of it's a servo motor. What's  [00:07:34] Speaker 0: that?  [00:07:35] Speaker 1: It's, basically an electric motor.  [00:07:37] User: charge.  [00:07:38] Speaker 2: Your rhinestones.  [00:07:39] Speaker 1: Yeah. I found  [00:07:40] User: It's a service.  [00:07:41] Speaker 2: It's a it it's just a motor. It just turns  [00:07:43] Speaker 1: Is that a  [00:07:44] Speaker 2: car? I think this is from my fucking throttle body. Does that have an electronic throttle body? And that's a door sensor. God isn't here. Mhmm.  [00:07:50] Speaker 1: 41  [00:07:51] User: A battery? What? Put it on? You actually want them?  [00:07:53] Speaker 2: I wanna see.  [00:07:54] Speaker 1: What's  [00:07:55] User: called the battery.  [00:07:57] Speaker 1: Walkie  [00:07:58] User: rider. Oh, those kind of batteries. So doing him do, like, a double a battery.  [00:08:01] Speaker 2: Yeah. Those only carry 1.5 volts. So I don't  [00:08:04] User: know. I didn't know many folks do whatever it  [00:08:06] Speaker 2: is. Everything on modern vehicles is 12 volts. Oh, wow. Except for, like, hybrids because they have  [00:08:11] User: Like, everything. Like, even something like actually, I don't even know. Do you guys just need batteries? That what that  [00:08:15] Speaker 2: The fuses protect circuits from amperage overloading. Oh,  [00:08:19] Speaker 1: okay.  [00:08:20] User: Alright. Never mind. I'm stupid.  [00:08:22] Speaker 2: Because current is measured in amps and then, Voltage is a measure of  [00:08:25] User: Not kilo. That's  [00:08:26] Speaker 1: white  [00:08:27] User: gold. Right? Let's  [00:08:29] Speaker 2: watch. Yeah. I'm trying to think what the first voltage is a measure of touching The average is the level of current.  [00:08:34] User: Anything related to that other than amps and voltage. I'll put it. What are these things?  [00:08:39] Speaker 2: Voltage is a measure of the electric potential difference  [00:08:41] Speaker 1: between  [00:08:42] Speaker 2: two points in a circuit indicating the amount of energy available to move electric charge. It's often described as the quote unquote pressure that pushes electrons through a conducting loop enabling them to do work. Those are end caps for my camshafts. And then camshaft, seals.  [00:08:54] User: It is also the field.  [00:08:55] Speaker 2: Those I honestly don't know what those are for. So There's they're, like, I I wanna say it's different from my fucking valve springs. But the fact that the fucking semi trailer  [00:09:01] Speaker 1: Yeah. That's what I was trying to say. I  [00:09:03] Speaker 2: don't think  [00:09:04] Speaker 1: they  [00:09:05] Speaker 2: are. Ambrege is a measure of the flow of the electric current in a circuit. It indicates the amount of electric charge in a point in the circuit for unit of time. There's a broken valve stem. I don't belong  [00:09:12] Speaker 1: Well, none of this This is a 3 year old's  [00:09:14] Speaker 2: boat. That is a windshield  [00:09:16] User: Are these  [00:09:17] Speaker 1: on? Are  [00:09:18] User: these on?  [00:09:19] Speaker 2: Yeah.  [00:09:20] User: Yes, sir.

Look  [00:09:27] Speaker 1: at  [00:09:28] Speaker 2: this  [00:09:29] Speaker 1: outfit. That's good. So  [00:09:30] Speaker 2: Yes, Sylvia.  [00:09:31] User: Anything? Anything just just one or do you need 1 of, like, one color or something like that? No. No. Yeah. No. Those are connected to the light thing.  [00:09:37] Speaker 1: That's  [00:09:38] Speaker 2: a retainer for, oil for fuel pump.  [00:09:41] Speaker 1: Oh,  [00:09:42] Speaker 2: the actual ones  [00:09:43] Speaker 1: Okay. Then. And so that's probably what you think they're.  [00:09:46] Speaker 2: Because, like, the center of those tiny. The center of those is rubber. Yeah. So, like, if I were to put a fucking retaining retain it  [00:09:53] Speaker 0: This wouldn't get inside there, but this might get inside of here because of that. Because it's me. I can't really tell you that he sits down himself. Wait. What happened? You need another one? Yeah.  [00:10:04] Speaker 1: Did you, by chance, see any of my fucking razor blades?

We shall return later to the connection. Between ideology and propaganda. Chapter 3, the necessity for propaganda. A common view of propaganda is that it is the work of a few evil men. Seducers of the people, cheats and authoritarian rulers who want to dominate a population, then it is the handmaiden of more or less illegitimate powers. This view always thinks of propaganda as being made voluntarily It assumes that a man decides to make propaganda then the government establishes a propaganda ministry. And if things just develop from thereon. According to this view, the power is just an object. A passive crowd that one can manipulate, influence, and use. And this notion is held not only by those who think one can manipulate the crowds, but also by those who think propaganda is not very effective and can be resisted easily. In other words, this view distinguishes between an active factor, the propaganda and the passive factor, the crowd. The mass, man, Good dog. According to this conception, propaganda is a sinister invention of the military cast. Or is actually it is the expression of modern society as a whole. Seen from that angle, it is easy to pushed into evil ways by the propagandist. The propagandist is entirely without blame because he has been fooled into fallen into a trap. The militant Nazi and communist are just poor victims who must not be fought. But must be psychologically liberated from that trap. We adapted to freedom. And shown the truth. In any event, the propaganda is seen in the role of the poor devil who can help himself. Who has no means of defense against the bird of prey who swoops down on him from the skies. A similar point of view can be found in studies on how advertising, which regard the buyer as victim and prey. In all this, the propaganda is never charged with the slightest responsibility for a phenomenon regarded as originating entirely outside of themselves. We know that the psychological factor which includes encirclement integration into a group, and participation in action in addition to personal conviction, is decisive. To draw up plans for an organization, a system of work, political methods, and institutions is not enough. The individual must participate in all this from the bottom of his heart. With pleasure and deep satisfaction, If the common market is wanted, a unit must be set up to psychologically prepare the people for the common market. This is absolutely necessary because the institutions mean nothing by themselves. NATO also needs propaganda for its members. Esperi's proposal of 1956 to create a new form that would correspond to the common form. Is extremely significant. Person political warfare is very inadequate. The economic point of view, one may well say that the recession was much more psychological than a technical or economic development. Footnote, As early as 1928, Edward Bernays  [00:07:02] Speaker 2: I was caught as an 8:40 on o'clock? Is the  [00:07:05] Speaker 1: modern instrument by which intelligent men can fight for productive end And help to bring order out of chaos. In order to assure that reforms will have vigor and effectiveness, one must first convince the people that no recession has occurred and that they have nothing to A specific example,  [00:07:23] Speaker 2: agricultural  [00:07:25] Speaker 1: reconstruction,  [00:07:26] Speaker 2: fire  [00:07:27] Speaker 1: the psychological problem. Services of popularization are permitted to furnish not only technical consultants, but primarily psychological agitators on the pattern of the famous county agents in the United States or the council in Scandinavia. Efforts at popularizing and at instilling conviction take place simultaneously. The USSR is still much more advanced in the direction of a full fledged agricultural public land with technically perfect and production, radio broadcasts, and films in daily publication of published results as in our press. Joining me this campaign of the local best explains the whole effort is He must accept and search for innovations like his work. Support his organization.

[00:08:21] Speaker 1: By a  [00:08:22] Speaker 2: propaganda conducted by a  [00:08:24] Speaker 1: The best example is the new German Army. The German soldier must be convinced of the validity of what he deserves. This psychological approach is designed to show or assumes an individual has been indoctrinated.  [00:08:36] Speaker 2: Oh.  [00:08:37] Speaker 2: Yeah.

To ensnare the innocent citizen. Rather, there is a citizen who craves propaganda from the bottom craving. Papagandists would not exist without potential propagandese to begin with. To understand that propaganda is not just a deliberate and more or less arbitrary creation by some people in power is therefore essential.  [00:09:20] User: It is  [00:09:21] Speaker 2: a strictly sociological  [00:09:22] Speaker 0: Simple reason that the masses have come to participate in political affairs. Let's not call this democracy. This is only one aspect of it. To begin with, there is the concrete reality of masses. In a sparsely populated country, politics can be made by small groups separated from each other and from the masses, which will not form a public opinion, and are remote from the centers of power. The nearness of the masses to the seats of power is very important. Pericles and Tiberius were well aware of it, as were Louis the 14th. And Napoleon.

[00:01:07] Speaker 2: Here, we can also see the idealist illusion of those who hope  [00:01:11] User: What'd she do?  [00:01:12] Speaker 3: She was rubbing her face on the fucking microphone towel.  [00:01:15] Speaker 2: Such as, for example, propaganda on the injustice of capitalism, on economic crisis, or on colonialism. Intellectuals  [00:01:21] User: But yeah. There's I don't know about the orange one, but  [00:01:24] Speaker 2: Only the public's smaller propaganda. Naturally, the educated man does not believe in propaganda. This  [00:01:30] User: is  [00:01:31] Speaker 4: What? Anybody else. Is  [00:01:32] Speaker 2: that This is also true. This is not only true for doctor Neur propaganda, which is based on exact facts, and acts on the level of the most highly developed people who have a sense of values and know a good deal about political realities. Such as, for example, the propaganda on the injustice of capitalism, on economic crises, or on colonialism, it is only normal that the most educated people intellectuals are the first to be reached by such propaganda. But this is also true for the crudest kind of propaganda. For example, the campaign on peace and  [00:02:06] Speaker 1: the campaign  [00:02:08] Speaker 3: on  [00:02:09] Speaker 2: bacteriological warfare were first successful in educated news.  [00:02:12] User: Right.  [00:02:13] Speaker 2: In France,  [00:02:15] Speaker 1: the  [00:02:16] User: intellectuals were So I rewinded it, like, 30 seconds too  [00:02:19] Speaker 2: early. Propaganda. But can you  [00:02:22] User: hear it? Did you hear that?  [00:02:24] Speaker 3: I didn't hear  [00:02:25] Speaker 2: that. Okay.  [00:02:26] User: Well, not in my okay. That's fine.  [00:02:29] Speaker 2: This is, in fact, one of his great weaknesses. An propagandist are well aware that in order to reach someone, one must first convince  [00:02:35] Speaker 0: Too much depth of doctrine is creating divergent currents and permitting the intellectual to escape social control.  [00:02:41] Speaker 1: So since I'm so convinced of my superiority and propaganda actually super effective on me.  [00:02:45] Speaker 2: That's not necessarily the part I was talking about, but basically believing that propaganda is ineffectual on you But these problems is what more susceptible. Condition reflexes  [00:02:56] Speaker 0: Oh,  [00:02:57] Speaker 1: I just don't think it's there has to be Foundation of Foundation from what  [00:03:01] Speaker 0: others on you.  [00:03:02] Speaker 1: Real, not at all. That  [00:03:05] User: was not a real fit. I was a boy.  [00:03:07] Speaker 1: To do a more profound propaganda job after the middle, one must Conversely, an individual of the middle class of good general culture will be less susceptible to agitation propaganda than ideal prey of integration propaganda. This has also been observed by Lipsett who holds that ignorance in politics and economics leads to conflicts in these spheres less clear. And therefore less intense to the observer. And for this reason, the ignorant or less susceptible to propaganda on such questions. Information. Of course, basic education permits the dissemination not only of propaganda, but of information in general. The same way with the new condition, Kopaka Contrary to the simplistic differentiation between propaganda and information, We have demonstrated a close relationship between the 2. In reality, to distinguish exactly between propaganda and information, impossible. Besides, information is an essential element of propaganda. For propaganda to succeed, it must have reference to political or economic reality. Doctor Noah's historical argument is only incidentally affected in propaganda. It has power only in connection with the interpretation of events. Has an effect only when an opinion is already aroused, troubled, or oriented in a certain direction by a political or economic event. It grasps itself onto an already existing psychological reality. Such psychological reactions are generally of brief duration and must be systematically sustained and renewed. To the extent that they will be prolonged and renewed, but we have no informed opinion with regard political or economic affairs. Obligand cannot exist. For this reason, in most of the older countries, propaganda was localized and restricted to those groups which had direct contact with political life. It was not designed for the masses and different to such questions. Indifference because they were uninformed. Masses cannot be interested in political and economic until mass most difficult to reach are the peasants for a variety of reasons already quite But another essential reason is that they are uninformed. Studies of rural and news have shown that propaganda begins to bite among peasants. The exact moment when information is promulgated there. When facts become known, the attention to certain questions is aroused. Obviously, if I do not know that war is being waged in Korea, and that North Korea and China are enemies, One of the United States occupies South Korea and that it represents the UN in Korea. Any gun? Communist propaganda on alleged American biological warfare means nothing to me. Papaganda means precisely nothing without preliminary information. Therefore, propaganda to politically ignorant groups can be made. Only if preceded by extensive, profound, and serious information work. Good note, This is why in the Soviet Union, one does not risks of information and propaganda. Dispenser of information. Radio and press are above all. Media of propaganda. Mister Pardanov, director of the TARS Agency said in 1956, information should be didactic and educative. Not to mention the fact that pure information is a excellent medium of propaganda. Bald information without commentary can lead to acceptance of a whole propaganda line. The broader and more objective view information, the more effective subsequent propaganda will be. Once again, propaganda does not base itself on errors but on exact facts. It even seems that the more informed, how more. Better, the more susceptible it is to propaganda. The greater a person's knowledge of political and economic facts the more sensitive and vulnerable is his judgment. Intellectuals are most easily reached by propaganda, particularly are a number of newspapers expressing diverse attitudes just because he is better informed is more so subjective than anyone else to a propaganda that we cannot perceive. Even though he claims to retain free choice in the management of all this information. Actually, he is being conditioned to absorb all the propaganda and This information not only provides the basis for propaganda, it gives propaganda means to  [00:06:38] Speaker 0: If you were ignorant of what went on in the nation and in the world and his only sources of information were equally uninformed neighbors. And in that case, propaganda would be impossible. Even if that man were actually to suffer personal difficulty as a result of certain political or economic situations, Abengand had no effect on the populations of the 19th century, even when a village was plundered by an army because in the face of personal experiences, people were But in any event,  [00:07:04] Speaker 1: the situation. To look upon it as a generally valid phenomenon. And to build a specific response to such a generalization, it would demand a considerable amount of voluntary intellectual labor. As propaganda becomes possible only when people develop a consciousness of general problems, say and specific responses to them. The formation of such responses is precisely what the promulgation of information creates in individuals who have only limited personal contact with social media. Through information, rebel against his immediate superiors. And it is well known that such rebellion leads nowhere That was the early discovery of the 19th century. An information will teach this worker that he shares Finally, informational teaching for evaluation the socialist slightly maintained, was much more wanted information than what propaganda. At that very moment, while information is absorbed, the spirit of rebellion transforms itself into the spirit of evolution. As a result of information, individuals come to feel that their own personal problems and Put down. Moreover, the newer the problem is raised, the more vulnerable that will be. The role of information is to introduce individuals to knowledge and new when he cannot relate to previous patterns, when in grief, opinion is nonstructured.

[00:03:51] Speaker 4: For actually, I didn't really think about it that much, but it's always sold with it's always sold or, like, you could always find them when you're looking at stones  [00:03:56] Speaker 2: or rocks. Mhmm.  [00:03:57] Speaker 4: I don't know why if it's a metal. I guess because it looks like  [00:04:00] Speaker 2: that.  [00:04:01] Speaker 4: What does it look like, the color when I'm  [00:04:03] Speaker 3: looking  [00:04:04] Speaker 5: at it?  [00:04:05] Speaker 2: Channel Is  [00:04:06] User: it like like on the edges where it's broken? Can you  [00:04:09] Speaker 3: see?  [00:04:10] Speaker 4: I was wondering if it looked kinda like the cutest rock. How, like, like, really gold or something like that whenever it's special here. Air,  [00:04:15] User: your nostril.  [00:04:16] Speaker 1: But we must remember that we cannot simply juxtapose those two types of proofs. Because a whole society is also composed of multiple groups. A conflict between primary and secondary opinions will arise. When  [00:04:24] Speaker 2: we've done this pre allopying like  [00:04:25] Speaker 1: Propaganda exists only in Alright.  [00:04:28] Speaker 3: So I think this is reflecting the color of the light that this shining on it because it looks like real  [00:04:32] Speaker 2: fucking it looks like silver, but I know it's not silver. Find some  [00:04:35] Speaker 1: self Might  [00:04:36] User: be.  [00:04:37] Speaker 4: It looks really silver actually. It does. It might be silver. Fish.  [00:04:41] Speaker 1: Corresponds  [00:04:42] Speaker 3: to  [00:04:43] Speaker 1: what we have said about the mass of society. The mass media of communication  [00:04:47] Speaker 4: mean, does it does the other parts that are reflecting on the light look  [00:04:50] Speaker 5: silver?  [00:04:51] Speaker 4: Or does that part look particularly silver? Like  [00:04:54] Speaker 2: that. The edge the broken edge that's particular silver.  [00:04:57] Speaker 4: Yeah. Okay. So maybe that's what it looks like whenever it's freshly baked. It's  [00:05:02] User: oxygen. Or maybe it needs to be exposed to heat, and that's how it gets to be, the colors of it. I don't know.  [00:05:06] Speaker 1: And well diversified with regard to their products on the other.  [00:05:09] Speaker 4: Yeah. And I like underneath it, it looks super cool too. Song  [00:05:12] Speaker 3: is a large  [00:05:14] Speaker 2: number. Yeah.  [00:05:15] Speaker 4: It's weird. I  [00:05:16] Speaker 2: can't I scale model  [00:05:18] Speaker 3: of, like, an alien  [00:05:19] Speaker 2: build  [00:05:20] Speaker 3: on. Like,  [00:05:21] Speaker 2: like a fucking temple or something.  [00:05:23] Speaker 1: It's still Welcome influences are sufficiently strong to neutralize the great national just one example. It's  [00:05:28] Speaker 2: a in  [00:05:29] Speaker 1: here. Hello?  [00:05:31] Speaker 4: Looks like you. Mine it is. I  [00:05:34] Speaker 7: don't know how that  [00:05:35] Speaker 4: would've got in there, though.  [00:05:37] Speaker 2: K. So I can't melt it in for you. What can I melt it in? All over. Alright. You have  [00:05:41] Speaker 1: be caught in a wide  [00:05:43] User: net of Well, you could use a ceramic  [00:05:45] Speaker 1: tile.  [00:05:46] Speaker 2: Not to to the tile?  [00:05:48] Speaker 4: Well, who said it's gonna  [00:05:50] Speaker 5: stick to it? It  [00:05:51] Speaker 4: probably won't stick to  [00:05:53] Speaker 3: it.  [00:05:54] Speaker 2: I can just,  [00:05:55] Speaker 3: like, keep that off and  [00:05:57] User: This is a little baby. Turned it really low. So  [00:06:00] Speaker 2: She said it's it's evaporated. 500 what?  [00:06:03] Speaker 3: It melts  [00:06:05] User: 570, I think.  [00:06:07] Speaker 4: Or yeah. That's what I said.  [00:06:09] Speaker 5: 540, something like  [00:06:11] Speaker 1: that.  [00:06:12] User: I think 600 would be good.  [00:06:14] Speaker 6: Or  [00:06:15] Speaker 4: 2 it was, like, 2 something  [00:06:17] User: Celsius.  [00:06:19] Speaker 2: 200 degrees Celsius.  [00:06:21] Speaker 4: Don't know for sure.  [00:06:22] Speaker 2: Why am I fucking here on a horse? I'm with you, bitch. I don't know what it is. I don't know. 108 degrees.  [00:06:27] Speaker 1: But the act of acquiring the set brings up a point that we will discuss in considerable length The complicity the propaganda If he is a propagandie, it is because he wants to be. For he is ready to buy a paper, go to the movies, pay for a radio,  [00:06:39] Speaker 7: or a TV set.  [00:06:41] Speaker 2: We don't do nothing to that.  [00:06:42] Speaker 1: He does not buy these in order to be propagandized. His motivations are more complex. But in doing these things, he must know that he opens the door to propaganda.  [00:06:50] Speaker 4: That's you. And  [00:06:51] Speaker 1: he  [00:06:52] Speaker 7: subjected to it.  [00:06:53] Speaker 1: Where he is conscious of this, the attraction of owning a radio is so much greater than the fear of propaganda. That he voluntarily agrees to receive propaganda.  [00:07:00] Speaker 2: 200 years. 4 This is even more  [00:07:03] Speaker 1: true where transmission is by collective receiving set. As in communist countries. The jurors gather even though they know what they hear is necessarily propaganda. But they cannot escape the attraction of the radio. Or the hypnotism of TV. The fact is even more striking with regard to the newspapers. When a reader buys a paper he likes, the paper in which he finds his own ideas and opinions will reflect he really wants to be propagandized. He wants to submit to his influence and actually exercise  [00:07:25] Speaker 7: his  [00:07:26] Speaker 1: his choice in the direction of the propaganda he wishes to receive. He cancels his subscription. He cannot stand anything that does not run on his rails. This is the very mentality of the propaganda.  [00:07:34] Speaker 7: As we see it. But  [00:07:36] Speaker 1: no one say  [00:07:37] Speaker 4: I was  [00:07:38] Speaker 7: kidding. Kind of. But I said that here  [00:07:41] Speaker 4: we're describing you. Right. And then but now but now what he's saying is, it said it's not new anymore. Talking about peep like, how people choose to be propagandized  [00:07:48] By  [00:07:49] Speaker 4: buying buying or paying to watch watch movies, like, watch the movies, different, like, whatever, or the you said radio too, like, but we don't really listen to radio like that anymore.  [00:07:55] User: Is it naughty?  [00:07:57] Speaker 4: Yeah. Good.  [00:07:58] Speaker 7: What the fuck? Yeah. Yeah.  [00:08:01] Speaker 4: What? That's crazy. It just now, like, balled up. Weird. Maybe you're doing to get a lower That was weird.  [00:08:06] User: Now do we go back to the other one?  [00:08:08] Speaker 3: If this shit cools  [00:08:10] Speaker 2: and fucking forms up into, like, the fucking alien twos again, I'm gonna fucking shit myself. Scared, Mid Ohio.  [00:08:16] Speaker 4: I don't know. I don't know if it's even up to the thing. Alright. Not all that. Not just  [00:08:20] Speaker 7: Yep.  [00:08:21] User: Not the box. I'm just thinking about  [00:08:23] Speaker 4: doing something interesting.  [00:08:25] Speaker 7: Yes.  [00:08:26] Speaker 4: Is it just because of the air and it's really light, or  [00:08:29] Speaker 7: is it because  [00:08:30] Speaker 4: it's liquid?  [00:08:31] Speaker 7: It's because it's liquid.  [00:08:32] Speaker 2: Well, It cools really quick too.  [00:08:34] Speaker 4: So it has a very small, like,  [00:08:36] Speaker 7: Areas  [00:08:37] Speaker 4: whatever it's called.  [00:08:39] Speaker 7: Mobility.  [00:08:40] User: Yeah.  [00:08:41] Speaker 0: Let it heat up and get smooth and then let it dry. Make or let it cool. So  [00:08:45] Speaker 1: This is the summon of proven life in action. For example, there is not much difference between the molds, the molds, and McCarthyism.  [00:08:50] Speaker 2: A different piece of  [00:08:51] Speaker 1: modification was  [00:08:53] User: normal. Yeah.  [00:08:54] Speaker 1: With a certain way of  [00:08:56] Speaker 2: life.  [00:08:58] Speaker 1: If you're  [00:09:00] Speaker 2: a high class  [00:09:01] Speaker 1: is a  [00:09:02] Speaker 2: sort of  [00:09:03] Speaker 1: ideal man.  [00:09:04] Speaker 3: Yeah. It is. I mean, I thought you mixed it up a lot, though. Right? Is  [00:09:07] Speaker 2: it  [00:09:08] Speaker 3: can you still speak clearly, isn't  [00:09:10] Speaker 1: it? By pressing the individual into  [00:09:12] User: a mode in which you  [00:09:13] Speaker 1: assume the design should is this clear? There are no Yeah.  [00:09:16] Speaker 2: Mhmm.  [00:09:17] Speaker 3: Well,  [00:09:18] Speaker 2: truly,  [00:09:19] Speaker 3: Jenny. Turn  [00:09:20] Speaker 1: it over?  [00:09:21] User: So I should get another one and  [00:09:23] Speaker 1: melt  [00:09:24] Speaker 3: it. I wanna, like, melt this the whole thing kind of.  [00:09:27] Speaker 1: But  [00:09:28] User: not this one. I don't know. It depends. Just  [00:09:31] Speaker 3: I get another one  [00:09:32] User: and it looks cooler, then we'll keep that one. All fucking  [00:09:34] Speaker 1: come  [00:09:35] Speaker 3: like that  [00:09:36] Speaker 1: and get a lot of  [00:09:37] Speaker 3: it. They do. They  [00:09:38] Speaker 1: all come like that.  [00:09:40] Speaker 3: They all look like that. Unavailable. Yeah. It's weird. With  [00:09:43] Speaker 1: opinions than with the way of pointing. The folks  [00:09:46] Speaker 2: find  [00:09:47] Speaker 1: a group or a family in which there are communists who is regarded as reprehensible in  [00:09:50] Speaker 3: the United  [00:09:51] Speaker 1: States is surprising because what matters here is not ideas, but a different way of life. This leads to the association of alcoholism and home homosexuality with communism in the literature on un American activities and to the rules promulgated in  [00:09:58] Speaker 2: You  [00:10:00] Speaker 3: haven't  [00:10:01] User: I don't know. I didn't hear it.  [00:10:02] Speaker 1: Which  [00:10:03] Speaker 3: establish  [00:10:05] Speaker 1: that is at a certain  [00:10:07] Speaker 3: standard.  [00:10:08] Speaker 4: Alcohol use and homosexuality. Discussed  [00:10:10] Speaker 1: later. In appendix 2.  [00:10:12] Speaker 3: What? We  [00:10:14] Speaker 1: are face to face here with the most total concept of propaganda. On the other side and with other formulas, there is McCarthyism.  [00:10:19] Speaker 3: Oh, my  [00:10:20] Speaker 2: god.  [00:10:21] Speaker 3: I'm not interested. This one.  [00:10:23] Speaker 4: It  [00:10:24] Speaker 1: expresses and at the same time, it's current.  [00:10:26] Speaker 4: At the most. That's a scale model of an early in city, babe.  [00:10:29] Speaker 2: It  [00:10:30] Speaker 1: deals less with  [00:10:32] Speaker 3: the p Alex, craves  [00:10:33] Speaker 2: in 1.  [00:10:35] Speaker 4: Yes. And  [00:10:36] Speaker 3: fire  [00:10:37] Speaker 1: Calm down. I'm talking to you. Representative in the United States That's somebody  [00:10:42] Speaker 3: can.  [00:10:43] Speaker 1: Because what matters here is not ideas, but a different way of life. This leads to the elimination of alcoholic So  [00:10:49] Speaker 4: if you  [00:10:50] Speaker 1: exactly  [00:10:52] Speaker 4: about the size of the Xanax.  [00:10:54] Speaker 3: There than that, there must be bigger established in the pool.  [00:10:56] Speaker 1: Security risk. And led to the screening of 7,000 functionaries. No. We didn't do this. Okay.  [00:11:02] Speaker 3: Yeah. I don't know. That one was common  [00:11:04] User: Let's see what big old 100 gram was. Because he fails to accept it. I don't  [00:11:10] Speaker 4: know.  [00:11:11] Speaker 3: I don't know for sure, but  [00:11:12] User: they start off at  [00:11:13] Speaker 3: a100, like, you have to choose your weight with everyone you want. Guessing you call us during the 5 100 different than the DigiGram one.  [00:11:20] Speaker 1: The US American prisoners have been eliminated by communes  [00:11:24] Speaker 4: treatment,  [00:11:26] Speaker 5: the hospital is about  [00:11:28] User: 600 grams, about American Union. Wants  [00:11:30] Speaker 1: to root out but fails to  [00:11:32] Speaker 2: cause  [00:11:33] User: This one is 450 grams.  [00:11:35] Speaker 4: Life.  [00:11:36] User: Then that one must be, like, the 6  [00:11:38] Speaker 3: 100 something. Because I don't want  [00:11:40] User: 650.  [00:11:41] Speaker 1: That's  [00:11:42] Speaker 3: To some  [00:11:43] Speaker 4: crazy.  [00:11:44] Speaker 1: The creation of normalcy in our society  [00:11:47] Speaker 3: continues.  [00:11:48] Speaker 4: The relationships  [00:11:50] Speaker 1: can be the result of scientific, psycho, sociological analysis based on statistic,  [00:11:54] Speaker 3: That is the  [00:11:55] Speaker 1: type of  [00:11:56] Speaker 3: normalcy. I looked it up. Let me think. Logical. I know. I'm still skeptical. I haven't done, like, damage research. I just looked it up to see if it was, like, a natural  [00:12:01] Speaker 1: thing. The individual to the pattern most useful to society.  [00:12:05] Speaker 4: Atomic number 83. Atomic mass  [00:12:08] Speaker 1: An hour  [00:12:09] Speaker 4: is culture. 9 a u.  [00:12:11] Speaker 3: In addition to a certain living standard, another condition Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't know  [00:12:13] Speaker 2: if I  [00:12:14] Speaker 3: meant  [00:12:15] Speaker 1: If managed to be successful propagandized, he needs at least a minimum of culture. Propaganda cannot succeed where people have no trace of western culture. But we are not speaking here of intelligence. Some primitive tribes are surely intelligent. But have an intelligence foreign to other concepts. Intelligence  [00:12:29] Speaker 4: authorities  [00:12:30] Speaker 1: resemble  [00:12:31] Speaker 4: the lighter group 15 For example, education arsenic and ant evidence to a progress  [00:12:35] Speaker 1: they still celebrate the decline of illiteracy as a a great victory. They condemn countries with a large proportion of the illiteracy since as they think the leading is a road to freedom. It has a slippery  [00:12:41] Speaker 4: water color when freshly produced.  [00:12:43] Speaker 1: Pretty  [00:12:44] Speaker 3: Okay. Yeah. So then able to I don't understand why  [00:12:47] Speaker 4: one  [00:12:48] Speaker 1: reads, to reflect on and judge what one reads. Outside of that, reading has no meaning. It either destroys certain automatic qualities of memory and observation. And to talk about critical faculties and discernment is to talk about something far above primary education and to convey a very small minority. A vast  [00:13:03] Speaker 3: majority of people It says is it it's magnetic or what's diamagnetic? Exercise  [00:13:08] Speaker 1: their intelligence beyond this.  [00:13:11] Speaker 4: Listen.  [00:13:12] Speaker 1: The  [00:13:13] Speaker 4: Internet authority and the Internet to the  [00:13:15] Speaker 1: do not possess enough knowledge to reflect and discern, I believe also force or dispute or dispute belief in total.  [00:13:20] Speaker 3: So I  [00:13:21] User: got that one for a dollar.  [00:13:23] Speaker 3: And as such people For a dollar 99.1  [00:13:25] Speaker 4: to see. See as far as the heart is can That's a guy that has no without  [00:13:30] Speaker 1: opposition. They are  [00:13:31] Speaker 4: perfectly  [00:13:32] Speaker 1: adapted to allow the  [00:13:34] Speaker 3: force of that  [00:13:35] Speaker 1: gun to kill the So does that say, if one day they're going  [00:13:39] Speaker 2: to  [00:13:40] Speaker 1: kill them, if they still receive a  [00:13:42] Speaker 3: better education They would do what? They would repel argument  [00:13:46] Speaker 1: has no validity because  [00:13:48] Speaker 3: understand. Just are not that way.  [00:13:49] Speaker 4: That is not  [00:13:50] Speaker 1: This is only the first  [00:13:51] Speaker 4: stage.  [00:13:52] Speaker 1: Soon their education  [00:13:53] Speaker 3: Yeah.  [00:13:54] Speaker 2: Interesting.  [00:13:56] User: Well, I don't know why my magnet's wet  [00:13:59] Speaker 4: right now.  [00:14:00] Speaker 3: Oh, I can hang on.  [00:14:01] Speaker 4: I wanna learn what they're saying. Right. Acts as a strong diamagnetic because it entirely expels any magnetic field from its interior.  [00:14:06] User: Hello.  [00:14:08] Speaker 4: I mean, it's not pushing  [00:14:09] Speaker 3: Maybe it just means it's not met maybe it means it's not non medic. At all and but you can make it  [00:14:14] Speaker 4: make it be the  [00:14:15] Speaker 3: What? The other one you said about, like, rejecting or what what is it called? What did you say? Repel. Repellet.  [00:14:20] Speaker 2: Or  [00:14:21] Speaker 3: whatever.  [00:14:22] Speaker 4: Let's go for most diamagnetic diamagnetic element.  [00:14:25] Speaker 3: Oh, sorry, baby.

And email application. Where users can create as many folder categories as desired but a resource may only be in 1 folder. Cluster techniques analyze a First, Identify a representative sample of resource instances to point properties or dimensions as candidate facets. Tell the classification on new instances and revise them. Sexy motherfucker. The simplest of to organizing topics is to create a sentence. This allows for easy identification of separate items in a Sorry, baby. All resources being organized.  [00:00:30] Speaker 1: One example of this is called structures  [00:00:32] User: in computer file systems and  [00:00:34] Speaker 2: email applications, where users can create as many folder categories as desired. But a resource may only be in 1 folder. Clustering techniques analyze a collection of uncategorized resources to discover statistical regularities or structure among the items. Thus creating categories without any labeled training data. These categories are created by maximizing the similarity of resources within a category and maximizing difference  [00:01:00] Speaker 1: Debate question. Is internalized racism among African Americans a product of historical oppression and systemic discrimination or is it a result of individual choice and psychological factors? Opening statements, Marxist leftist debate. Internalized racism among African Americans cannot be separated from the historical and material conditions that have shaped their experiences in a society rooted in white supremacy and capitalism. For centuries, African Americans have been subjected to slavery, segregation, and systemic all of which have created conditions where racist ideologies have been embedded in the social fabric. The idea that African Americans internalize racism is not simply a psychological issue, but a survival mechanism within a society that continually devalues blackness. These internalized beliefs are the result of a centuries old conditioning process. Deeply intertwined with the economic structures that rely on racial higher hierarchies to maintain inequality. Sex and motherfuckers. Internalize these racist attitudes. It is not a matter of personal failure, but the outcome of a society built on structural racism that continuously reinforce these messages. Therefore, we must examine the roots of this internalization within the broader context of racial capitalism, and imperialism. Typical opponent, Internalized racism is certainly a complex issue, but I believe it can also be seen as a personal matter. People have agency over their beliefs and behaviors. And it's not entirely fair to blame society or historical oppression for every instance of self hate or internalized bias. African Americans, like any group, can choose to overcome negative stereotypes and prejudices even if they've been exposed to them. Of course, systemic racism exists, but we can't ignore the power of individual resilience and the ability to reject harmful ideologies. Overcoming internalized racism, in this view, is about personal growth in empowerment, and breaking free from the negative narratives that's society has imposed. It's about understanding and reasserting one's identity despite the forces trying to devalue it. Back and forth exchanges Marxist leftist debater. It is crucial to understand that internalized racist  [00:02:23] Speaker 0: Pervasive and structural. For example, black people are often portrayed as criminals or as poor, uneducated, and laid This feeds into a sense of inferiority that many individuals in internalize over time, often without even realizing it. So I would ask how can we divorce this internalization from the systemic forces that constantly push black people to view themselves through the lens of white supremacy. How can we claim that this is simply a site psychological issue? To be  [00:02:56] Speaker 1: question, is the capitalist system inherently exploitative? Relying on a manufactured false consciousness to perpetuate inequality and prevent the working majority from recognizing and collectively challenging their oppression?  [00:03:06] User: You hungry?  [00:03:08] Speaker 1: From wage labor to privatized manufacturing, every aspect Natural. Planet, and to confront the reality that what it may take as freedom under capitalism is an illusion engineered for stall class consciousness. Sure. Capitalism may not be perfect, but let's not pretend it's some grand scheme of oppression. It's simply a system that allows individuals to rise based on effort, Talent. And personal initiative The world is richer and more technologically advanced than ever before. People in capitalist countries enjoy choices comforts, and opportunities unimaginable under any other system. If workers felt so exploited and if this so called false consciousness were really preventing them from seeing the truth, what do we see massive sustained revolts everywhere. Instead, people often defend the market's freedoms and inspire to move up the economic ladder. Hardly the behavior of Duke victims. Let's be reasonable. Capitalism, while flawed, encourages innovation, rewards hard work, and expands overall prosperity. To argue that it's inherently exploitative or that everyone's been bamboozled by some invisible ideological apparatus seems more like a conspiracy theory. Than a coherent critique. Back and forth exchanges, Marxist left is debating. Your response presumes that if capitalism were truly exploitative, workers would instantly revolt. But consider how deeply capitalist ideology from childhood. People learn that private property is sacrosanct. That success equates to wealth and that competition is the natural state of human relations. These are not neutral facts. Ideological constructs. The absence of open rebellion,  [00:04:51] Speaker 2: is not proof of  [00:04:53] Speaker 1: consent. But of resignation confusion. People may choose to work under exploitative conditions. But this occurs in a context shaped by necessity. Limited alternatives, ideological conditioning Wages remain stagnant while profits soar. The majority receives only a fraction of the value they produce. While a few accumulate fortunes that translate into political and cultural power. Is it not telling that those with financial might invest heavily in media outlets, political campaigns, and think tanks to ensure workers' internalized narratives justifying the status quo is inevitable. Typical opponent This idea that people are conditioned just sidesteps human agency. Markets give people what they want. If someone doesn't like their job, they can find another one. If they believe wages are too low, can start their own business. The fact that millions dream of making it in a capitalist framework starting a company, innovating  [00:05:42] Speaker 2: something  [00:05:44] Speaker 1: climbing the corporate ladder. Contradiction narrative. People don't seem to feel coerced. They voluntarily participate because they see tangible benefits. Also, economic opportunities the chance for a better life, and access to consumer goods are all more abundant in capitalist societies than in command economies. Would people notice if they were systematically being shortchanged? Marxist left this debater. People can certainly move from one low wage shop to another. But is that genuine freedom or a manipulated set of restricted choices? The fact that countless individuals accept conditions that barely meet their base needs doesn't negate exploitation. It confirms its ubiquity. This is precisely how false consciousness operates. It frames limited options as personal choices masking the structural barriers that prevent collective power. Let's consider actual data. Income inequality has soared globally. With the wealthiest 1% owning more wealth than the rest combined in many countries. If innovation and opportunity were equitably available, why do we see such persistent patterns of concentration at the top? Moreover, your suggestion that one can simply start a business ignores the obstacles. Access to capital, and transcorporate power market saturation. That ensure most fail. Does it not strike you as strange that so much of our collect creativity is channeled not toward meeting human needs but towards securing profits for a minority class typical opponent, Inequality isn't automatically exploitation. Some people simply work harder invest wisely, or come up with groundbreaking ideas. The top earners might indeed own a lot. But they also  [00:07:06] Speaker 2: create jobs.  [00:07:08] Speaker 1: Fund research, and donate to charitable causes.  [00:07:11] Speaker 2: Maybe the system isn't perfect,  [00:07:14] Speaker 1: but it's improved living standards worldwide. People own cars, smartphones, and have services at their fingertips. Under capitalism, revolutions aren't happening because by and large, people find the system acceptable. If false consciousness were so powerful wouldn't it have to be constantly pulled by brute force? Instead, we have free speech, open criticism, oppressed that can scrutinize the company. How is that consistent with a system built on mass deception? Marxist leftist  [00:08:00] Speaker 2: debate  [00:08:01] Speaker 1: power and capitalism doesn't always require brute force. It thrives on subtlety. The ideology is reproduced not merely by censorship, but by shaping what people consider common sense. Corporate media outlets frame poverty as an individual failing. Not a systemic issue. Education systems present capitalism  [00:08:24] Speaker 0: Oh, that's how I come in to see. Take it, Kipsey. Take it. 6 months. Go potty. Go outside. Go party. Come on. People aren't tricked.  [00:08:34] Speaker 1: They just see no better alternative. Attempts and so Marcus left his  [00:08:38] User: Good boy.  [00:08:40] Speaker 1: Conflict and cooperation. Capitalism might be flawed, but it also fosters international trade, cultural exchange, and technological progress.

And only after a  [00:05:23] Speaker 4: dozen  [00:05:24] Speaker 3: And you're after I read all was like, dude, it should be a badass movie. And then they made it a movie. I was like, this fucking movie sucks.  [00:05:30] Speaker 2: As  [00:05:31] Speaker 1: early as 1920, integration propaganda as conceived by Lennon was employed. But it dampens the revolutionary mentality only very  [00:05:37] Speaker 3: It wasn't that bad. But  [00:05:38] Speaker 1: 1920 knots and the effects of agitation  [00:05:41] Speaker 3: The book was Disappeared. Ridiculously much better. Like, how much better fucking the Game of Thrones books were than the fucking show? Never watched that shit?  [00:05:46] Speaker 1: On the f 19 29, did the effects of education come propaganda finally disappear? The cruise stopped prevented was a striking  [00:05:52] Speaker 2: example.  [00:05:54] Speaker 1: By agitation. Alright. You guys have the  [00:05:56] Speaker 2: whole And I saw  [00:05:58] Speaker 4: all  [00:05:59] Speaker 3: the  [00:06:00] Speaker 1: time on the  [00:06:02] Speaker 4: road.  [00:06:03] Speaker 2: It's on Google Chrome.  [00:06:04] Speaker 1: The propaganda aimed at DSA and SS was agitation propaganda. As was the propaganda pushing the German people into war in 1939  [00:06:11] Speaker 4: circle.  [00:06:12] Speaker 2: 39. Yeah.  [00:06:13] Speaker 1: The same time, the population as a whole was subjected to a proper I think so. I think  [00:06:17] Speaker 2: that a long time ago because I didn't like I need to change it back because it's touching really annoying. Yeah. I changed it because I didn't  [00:06:23] Speaker 4: don't  [00:06:24] Speaker 3: know.  [00:06:25] User: Did you remember  [00:06:26] Speaker 2: me? No. I  [00:06:27] Speaker 4: didn't  [00:06:28] User: want you to, like,  [00:06:29] Speaker 2: I  [00:06:30] User: didn't know what you're gonna  [00:06:31] Speaker 2: do. I  [00:06:32] User: mean, I hope you wouldn't do that, but I also got  [00:06:34] Speaker 2: a thought that, like education,  [00:06:36] Speaker 1: use your voice. I know.  [00:06:38] User: Not that I don't want you, like  [00:06:40] Speaker 2: Exactly.  [00:06:41] Speaker 5: I just don't  [00:06:42] User: want  [00:06:43] Speaker 2: you to,  [00:06:44] Speaker 5: like,  [00:06:45] Speaker 2: ruin anything,  [00:06:47] Speaker 4: I  [00:06:48] Speaker 2: guess. Oh, I didn't do that.  [00:06:50] Speaker 1: And finally pursued his agitation. This will lead inevitably to dictatorship. And probably some more. Other regimes, however, have managed perfectly well to pass from one propaganda to the other and to make integration propaganda take the lead rapidly. This was the case of  [00:07:02] Speaker 4: North  [00:07:03] Speaker 2: Vietnam  [00:07:04] Speaker 3: China.  [00:07:05] Speaker 1: And we're going the remarkable  [00:07:07] Speaker 4: conception of  [00:07:08] Speaker 1: propaganda, which  [00:07:09] Speaker 4: they have  [00:07:10] Speaker 1: had since the time of the revolution. Oh,  [00:07:12] Speaker 2: really? In fact,  [00:07:14] Speaker 1: since 1927, now this propaganda has been subversive. I'm glad you didn't really know. It appeals to the most  [00:07:20] Speaker 3: basic  [00:07:21] Speaker 2: feelings in the world.  [00:07:23] User: My letters. Some of them are good. I'm glad that you didn't ruin the one.  [00:07:27] Speaker 3: Is a sexual education.  [00:07:29] Speaker 2: A  [00:07:30] User: first one  [00:07:31] Speaker 1: ago. Long winded explanations telling him why it is necessary to act a particular way. A bias with seemingly objective news system is set on this part of that propaganda. Behavior is  [00:07:39] User: regimented. It's just it's still done, but it's all caps  [00:07:42] Speaker 2: and x y e. Into a prodigious date. That's really annoying. Yeah. I did that, like, over a month ago, I think. After  [00:07:47] Speaker 1: victory. And to be inserted into the new society regardless systems or environmental explosion. This patient in particular is shaping of the whole man is putting into the mold.  [00:07:55] Speaker 3: Of course, Every time I situation in which  [00:07:57] Speaker 1: man would integrate group, and he substituted one complete framework for another. Also, he needed only to shape the minds of people who had had very little education Had?  [00:08:05] Speaker 2: In the western sense of  [00:08:06] Speaker 1: the term. So that they learned to understand everything through  [00:08:09] Speaker 2: god. I thought I heard you.  [00:08:10] Speaker 1: Some interpretations that he knew how to inculcate.  [00:08:13] Speaker 3: Inculcate? Under such conditions,  [00:08:15] Speaker 1: integration  [00:08:16] Speaker 3: is easy  [00:08:17] Speaker 4: and  [00:08:18] Speaker 1: practically irreversible. Explains the defeat of French propaganda in Algeria. Since 1955. On one side, the propaganda of the FLN was an act of agitation designed to arouse feelings of subversion and combat. Against this, the French army painted a propaganda of integration. Of assimilation into a French framework and into the French administration. French political concepts, education, professional training, ideology. But a world of difference lay between the two as to speed, ease, and effectiveness. Which explains why in this competition between propagandists, the FLN won out at almost every stage. This does not mean that FLN propaganda reflected the real feeling of the Algerians. I'm calling  [00:08:49] Speaker 2: somebody  [00:08:50] Speaker 1: else. You're unhappy. So rise and slay your master, and tomorrow you will be free. And others say, we will help you, work with you, and in the end, all your problems will be solved. There is little question as to who will command the Legion. Of course. John. Yes. Of  [00:09:02] User: everything. Ah. You've got to do it.  [00:09:04] Speaker 1: Integration propaganda. As  [00:09:05] User: we Good afternoon.  [00:09:07] Speaker 1: Is by far the most important new  [00:09:09] Speaker 3: fact  [00:09:10] Speaker 2: about  [00:09:11] Speaker 3: Yay.  [00:09:12] Speaker 1: Vertical and horizontal propaganda. Classic propaganda, as one usually thinks of it, is a vertical propaganda. In the sense that it is made by a deeper, a technician, a political or religious head, who acts from the superior position of his authority and seeks to influence the crowd below. Such propaganda comes from above, It is conceived in the secret recesses of political enclaves. It uses all technical methods of centralized mass communication.  [00:09:34] Speaker 4: Let  [00:09:35] Speaker 2: my teammate. Wow. I was about to run into that.  [00:09:37] Speaker 1: Develops a massive individuals. But those who practice it are on the outside.  [00:09:40] Speaker 2: Oh my god. I was recalling like a horrible session Saturday. My  [00:09:44] Speaker 1: guy? Last well between direct affect the propaganda.  [00:09:48] User: Damn. It's killing everybody. I'm  [00:09:50] Speaker 4: like,  [00:09:51] User: should I hate can  [00:09:52] Speaker 1: I hate it?  [00:09:54] User: The mind can be able  [00:09:55] Speaker 4: to  [00:09:56] Speaker 3: quote.  [00:09:57] Speaker 2: Shit. Oh, hi. You can  [00:09:59] Speaker 1: even  [00:10:00] Speaker 6: over here.  [00:10:01] Speaker 1: For hatred. Got. There's a direct. She's in front of me. I put it down on a bus. Really? That was  [00:10:06] Speaker 3: the mouse.  [00:10:07] Speaker 6: Yeah.  [00:10:08] Speaker 1: The propaganda requires a passive attitude from those subjected to it.  [00:10:12] Speaker 2: A rebel  [00:10:14] User: already  [00:10:15] Speaker 7: is there. They  [00:10:16] Speaker 4: are  [00:10:17] Speaker 1: manipulated They are commissioned.  [00:10:19] Speaker 0: He's not his own. Though he believes it is. Wait. We're talking. Throughout, it is conceived and willed outside of him. The propagandist is acting through him. Wait. Why are y'all feeding me? Remember, I guess I do the same thing. Thanks, Yalla. There's nothing Sally. Oh, fuck you. The little guy? Mhmm. This is all the morseau because he often is plunged into a mass of propagandies in which he loses his individuality. And becomes one element among others inseparable from the crowd and inconceivable without it. In any case, vertical propaganda is by far the most widespread. You  [00:10:52] Speaker 1: guys still like oh, okay. No. You're you're thinking it. sense  [00:10:55] Speaker 2: what it is  [00:10:56] Speaker 1: to make. But its direct effects are extremely perishable, and it must be renewed constantly.  [00:11:01] User: Frank. No.  [00:11:03] Speaker 1: It is primarily useful for education propagator. Horizontal propaganda is a much more recent development. We know it in 2 forms, Chinese propaganda and group dynamics in human relation. The first is political propaganda. The second is sociological propaganda. Both are integration propaganda. Their characteristics surprising as that may seem when we consider their totally different origins. In context, research methods and perspective,  [00:11:29] User: Physics.  [00:11:30] Speaker 0: His presence and his identity are not even known.  [00:11:32] Speaker 0: Meetings are intimate. Discussion is informal. Non leader resides. Progress is slow. There must be many meetings each recalling events of the preceding one. So that a common experience can be shared. To produce voluntary rather than  [00:11:49] Speaker 1: Are they all jumbled up again? No? Okay.  [00:11:51] Speaker 0: Much more effective and binding than the mechanical action of physical propaganda. When the individual is mechanized, he can be manipulated easily. But the good him  [00:11:57] Speaker 1: on expects is much more so than the money. Oh, okay. Vertical propaganda needs the huge apparatus of the mass media.  [00:12:02] Speaker 2: I didn't know  [00:12:03] Speaker 1: that was  [00:12:04] Speaker 2: you, so I thought it was, like, a bag  [00:12:06] Speaker 3: of Oh, I'm sorry?  [00:12:08] Speaker 1: Organization of people. Each individual must be inserted into a group, impossible into several groups with convergent actions. The groups must be homogeneous, specialized, and small. 15  [00:12:16] Speaker 0: Such men must be unswerving, integrated into the group themselves, and must a stabilizing and lasting influence. They must be members of an integrated political body. In this case, the Communist Party. This form of propaganda needs 2 conditions. First of all, a lack of contact between groups. A member of small group must not belong to other groups in which he would be subjected to other influences. That would give him a chance to find himself again and with it, the strength to resist. This is why the Chinese communist insisted on breaking up traditional groups  [00:12:39] Speaker 1: sexes, and occupations the family is a tremendous obstacle to such propaganda. In China, where the family was still very powerful, it had to be broken up. The problem is very different in the United States and in the western societies. There, the social structures are sufficiently flexible and disentangles to be no obstacle. It is not necessary to break up the family in order to make the group dynamic and fully The family already is broken. And no longer has the power to envelop the individual. It is no longer the place where the individual is formed and has his roots. The feeling is clear for the influence of small groups.  [00:13:17] Speaker 0: That? Oh, babe.  [00:13:18] Speaker 1: Was weird. Sorry.  [00:13:20] Speaker 0: Was it a good pillow? What was I  [00:13:21] Speaker 1: was just I didn't know. We're not  [00:13:23] Speaker 0: doing that. Reality through groups that are not This  [00:13:25] Speaker 1: and what is lived in Obviously, no political instruction is possible there. No. All Americans already know the great principles and institutions of democracy.  [00:13:32] Speaker 2: Oh, that was awesome. Political.  [00:13:34] Speaker 1: Their education is specifically democratic. They used  [00:13:37] Speaker 2: to say Sorry. To take action.  [00:13:39] Speaker 1: How to behave as members of a  [00:13:41] Speaker 2: democracy.  [00:13:42] Speaker 3: We will  [00:13:43] Speaker 1: It is indeed  [00:13:45] Speaker 3: a civil  [00:13:46] Speaker 1: education. A civil education. Are you live  [00:13:48] Speaker 3: in?  [00:13:49] User: Yes. It's  [00:13:50] Speaker 2: it's one we're in London right  [00:13:52] Speaker 4: I think it's just lagging because the Christmas update or something. It's, like, really lagging.  [00:13:55] Speaker 1: Propaganda aimed at obtaining adherence to a society, its principles its ideology, and its myths. Probably and the regime employing horizontal propaganda can come  [00:14:05] User: into  [00:14:06] Speaker 2: her style. Old construction. I gotcha. Oh, okay.  [00:14:09] Speaker 1: Requires the breaking up of other groups, such as the family. Now we must understand that the education given in the political small groups requires either the disappearance of academic education or its integration into the system. In the organization then, William h White, clearly shows the way in which the American school is becoming more and more a simple letter to adapt youngsters to American society. As for the Chinese school, it is only a system of propaganda charged with catechizing children. While teaching them to read. Horizontal propaganda  [00:14:36] Speaker 5: does seem very  [00:14:37] Speaker 1: hard to make. Particularly because it needs so many instructors.  [00:14:40] Speaker 2: No.  [00:14:41] Speaker 4: This is a  [00:14:42] Speaker 2: situation  [00:14:43] Speaker 1: that has been through its meticulous encirclement of everybody. In the effect of the  [00:14:48] Speaker 5: itself. It is  [00:14:49] User: You sucker, fake bot you, hate you.  [00:14:51] Speaker 5: Calling  [00:14:52] Speaker 2: themselves terrorists. I know. I'm sorry to hear that.  [00:14:54] Speaker 1: The person who are alive alike, and when actually can formulate the will of such a  [00:15:00] Speaker 6: group. Sadie Iran. But all this is ultimately Is that an oxymoron? Into  [00:15:04] Speaker 1: totalitarian  [00:15:05] Speaker 3: and  [00:15:06] Speaker 1: exclusive propaganda.  [00:15:08] Speaker 2: It's  [00:15:09] Speaker 6: like system view. Has succeeded in passing. No.  [00:15:12] Speaker 5: Oh,  [00:15:13] Speaker 4: okay. Very good. Like, because I ran as I ran as, like, I running I'm running. I'm  [00:15:18] Speaker 6: Jamie  [00:15:19] Speaker 5: or  [00:15:20] Speaker 6: No. Like, Iran, like, it's like a It's like a It probably gets like, has, like, a bunch of desert in it is still a well established where there's no shade. Oh,  [00:15:25] Speaker 4: okay. Okay. I get  [00:15:27] Speaker 2: it.  [00:15:28] Speaker 1: Distinction between propaganda and information is  [00:15:30] Speaker 6: Oh, damn. Information is Oh my god. Who? Penguin. The green  [00:15:34] Speaker 2: I think I'm gonna get it. Expressed to me. Fucking  [00:15:36] Speaker 5: booster.  [00:15:38] Speaker 1: So simple. Or there is such a thing as rational propaganda.  [00:15:40] Speaker 5: Just as  [00:15:42] Speaker 1: there is rational advertising.  [00:15:43] Speaker 5: I've  [00:15:44] Speaker 1: heard this one for automobiles  [00:15:46] Speaker 6: or electrical companies. He says advertising. He says advertisement.  [00:15:49] Speaker 1: Improvement.  [00:15:50] Speaker 6: Mhmm.  [00:15:51] Speaker 1: Well,  [00:15:53] Speaker 2: Similarly,  [00:15:54] Speaker 1: there is a propaganda based  [00:15:56] Speaker 5: I  [00:15:58] Speaker 4: don't know, actually.  [00:15:59] Speaker 2: I can't change these facts.  [00:16:01] Speaker 4: Economic I was gonna say  [00:16:03] Speaker 2: maybe  [00:16:04] Speaker 4: the way it's spelled  [00:16:06] Speaker 5: Yeah.  [00:16:07] Speaker 1: Ever Actually, since I joined  [00:16:09] Speaker 2: converted. I don't know.  [00:16:11] Speaker 1: Based on the undeniable scientific progress  [00:16:13] Speaker 5: and  [00:16:14] Speaker 1: economic development of the Soviet Union. Murder is still propaganda, If  [00:16:18] Speaker 5: he  [00:16:19] Speaker 6: doesn't  [00:16:20] Speaker 4: have a million pauses  [00:16:21] Speaker 1: straight rational Fuck. The superiority of its system demands to demand everybody's support.  [00:16:26] Speaker 5: No.  [00:16:27] Speaker 6: God dammit. What  [00:16:29] Speaker 5: happened?  [00:16:31] User: Are you using a Ruby?  [00:16:32] Speaker 1: Obvious facts. When an enemy army has just suffered a defeat, an appeal to enemy soldiers to surrender will seem rational. The superiority of one of the combatants becomes a Oh, but His appeal for surrender is an appeal to reason. Similarly, the propaganda of French grandeur since 1950 8 is a rational and factual propaganda. French films in particular are almost all centered around French technological success The film, Algerian, France, is an economic film. Overloaded with economic geography and statistics. But it's to do this. Propaganda. Hey. How's  [00:17:01] Speaker 2: it going? Oh, is this  [00:17:03] User: 3 the 3 squares aren't your friends. Right? Oh, for the Jonas. Okay.  [00:17:06] Speaker 2: That's  [00:17:08] Speaker 4: why. I could've sworn that was a u  [00:17:10] Speaker 6: player. 3 square  [00:17:12] Speaker 4: The 3 squares guy with their  [00:17:13] Speaker 2: their name,  [00:17:15] Speaker 5: sir. 3  [00:17:16] Speaker 4: squares?  [00:17:18] Speaker 1: Accept them  [00:17:19] Speaker 6: I have no idea. I'm not confirming  [00:17:21] Speaker 5: yeah.  [00:17:23] Speaker 2: Also attempt.  [00:17:24] User: Ah, fuck me. I've done  [00:17:26] Speaker 2: the battle.  [00:17:27] Speaker 3: I'm  [00:17:28] Speaker 6: fucking spinning. American services  [00:17:29] Speaker 2: aren't  [00:17:30] Speaker 5: typical. Goddamn it.  [00:17:32] Speaker 1: And nothing resembles these American publications more than the public, which has taken over exactly the same propaganda style. We can say that the more progress we make, more propaganda becomes rational. The more it is based on serious argument.  [00:17:43] Speaker 2: I'm a nation  [00:17:45] Speaker 5: of  [00:17:46] Speaker 6: knowledge. God. The Irish one's a nation.  [00:17:47] Speaker 5: It  [00:17:48] Speaker 6: hasn't.  [00:17:49] Speaker 1: Have correctly noted the differences in this connection between the propaganda of 1914 and that of 1940. The latter is more sober and informative. Less emotional and more or less As we say in fashion of opponents, it is abreast less to the superego and more to the ego.  [00:18:06] Speaker 4: Snake.  [00:18:07] Speaker 6: Yeah.  [00:18:08] Speaker 4: We're on either side  [00:18:09] Speaker 1: of contained elements of fact. If there's most inflammatory species, always contain some fats which serve as base or pretext.  [00:18:13] Speaker 5: How it has affected go?  [00:18:14] Speaker 1: Nowadays to find a frenzy propaganda composed so of claims without relation to reality. It is still found in Egyptian propaganda it appeared in July 1960 in Lumumba's propaganda in the Belgian Congo. Such propaganda is now discredited but it still convinces and always excites. Other men needs relation to facts, a self justification to convince himself that by acting in a certain way, he is obeying reason and proved experience. We must, therefore, study the close relationship between information and propaganda. Propaganda's content increasingly resembles information, It has even clearly been  [00:18:41] Speaker 3: proved  [00:18:43] Speaker 1: better violent, excessive, shock provoking propaganda text leads ultimately to less conviction and are to patient. A more  [00:18:48] Speaker 3: informative  [00:18:49] Speaker 2: text on the  [00:18:50] Speaker 1: same subject. A large dose of fear precipitates immediate action. A reasonably small dose produces lasting support. The listeners' critical powers decrease if the propaganda message is more rational bless Violet. Abbogand's content therefore attempts to be rational and factual. But is this enough to show that propaganda is  [00:19:15] Speaker 4: It was a fucking bot?  [00:19:16] Speaker 1: Is that It  [00:19:18] Speaker 4: was  [00:19:19] Speaker 2: rebels or  [00:19:20] Speaker 4: what? No. It wasn't. Wait. Was it? The bot  [00:19:23] Speaker 2: was rebel?  [00:19:24] Speaker 4: That's funny.  [00:19:26] Speaker 5: When  [00:19:27] Speaker 1: an individual has read a textbook  [00:19:29] Speaker 2: That's  [00:19:30] Speaker 4: dumb.  [00:19:31] Speaker 1: I don't know what to do. How does that happen?  [00:19:33] Speaker 4: You can feed the bot to make it, like, the biggest on the board, and then they become rebel. Wheel suspension. Which is what  [00:19:38] Speaker 2: initially happened?  [00:19:40] Speaker 3: All  [00:19:41] Speaker 1: those technical descriptions and the exact details will form a general picture in his head rather vague, but highly covered, And when he speaks of the engine, he will say, it's terrific.  [00:19:48] Speaker 5: It  [00:19:49] Speaker 1: is exactly the same with all rational, logical, factual, propaganda. Does the leader remember the figures and statistics as he understood the as you absorb the line of reasoning if he is not an economist by profession, he will retain an overall impression  [00:20:01] Speaker 6: Gipsy Golladay.  [00:20:03] Speaker 5: That  [00:20:04] Speaker 1: these Americans thought Russians, They have methods. Progress is important after all. And so on. Similarly, emerging from the show and other films such as Algeria Francees, he forgets all the figures and logical proofs  [00:20:16] Speaker 5: and retains all  [00:20:18] Speaker 3: the  [00:20:19] Speaker 5: feeling  [00:20:20] Speaker 1: of  [00:20:21] Speaker 5: right  [00:20:22] Speaker 1: foot pride in the accomplishments of France and Algeria. Yeah. Thereafter, what remains with the individual affected by this propaganda? Is a perfectly irrational picture. A purely emotional event, a myth.  [00:20:30] Speaker 2: Uh-uh. A myth. That's the first thing.  [00:20:32] Speaker 1: All I forgot.  [00:20:33] Speaker 2: No.  [00:20:34] Speaker 1: Of the impression. And this is indeed what the propagandist ultimately seeks. The individual will never begin to act on the basis of facts to engage in purely rational  [00:20:42] Speaker 6: behavior. More dogs. Pigs  [00:20:43] Speaker 1: Invasion of the future. The myth, The problem is to create an irrational response on the basis of rational  [00:20:48] Speaker 5: and  [00:20:49] Speaker 1: factual elements. That response must be fed with facts. The spranes must then promote rigorous and logical proofs. Thus propaganda in itself becomes honest, straight, exact, but its effect remains irrational. Because of the spontaneous transformation of all its contents by the individual. We emphasize that this is true not just for propaganda, but also for information. Except for the specialist, information, even when it is very well presented, means people only abroad in each of the world. And much of the information disseminated nowadays, research findings facts, statistics, explanations, analysis, eliminate personal judgment and the capacity to form one's own opinion. Even  [00:21:20] Speaker 5: more  [00:21:21] Speaker 4: Oh my god. You don't answer. You're still in right into the  [00:21:24] Speaker 5: rock.  [00:21:25] Speaker 4: Yeah.  [00:21:26] Speaker 1: He drowned him.  [00:21:27] Speaker 4: What's that  [00:21:28] Speaker 1: mean?  [00:21:29] Speaker 0: Are terrific and so on. A survey of data far from permitting people to make judgments and form opinions, prevents them from doing so and actually paralyzed. Miss you, Keith. They are caught of a well informed and must remain at the level of the facts they have been given. They cannot even form a choice or a judgment in other areas or on other subjects. Thus, the mechanisms of modern information induce a sort of hypnosis in the individual who cannot get out of the field that has been laid out for him by the information.  [00:21:59] Speaker 1: His opinion  [00:22:00] Speaker 0: will ultimately be formed solely on the basis of the  [00:22:01] Speaker 1: Loaded. Individual issued by state information. That's the truth. But I  [00:22:04] Speaker 2: don't know if that means something  [00:22:05] Speaker 1: like I hope so. Know.  [00:22:07] User: Oh,  [00:22:08] Speaker 2: okay. That means  [00:22:09] User: for me. Okay. That's what that means.  [00:22:11] Speaker 3: I've used loaded. To describe  [00:22:13] Speaker 1: my high  [00:22:14] Speaker 3: I've used loaded to describe, like, having money  [00:22:16] Speaker 1: Yeah. So  [00:22:17] Speaker 2: I was I I knew  [00:22:19] Speaker 1: of,  [00:22:20] Speaker 2: like,  [00:22:21] User: knew I was familiar with the meaning something, and then when you said, I hope so, I was like, oh, yeah. It means something.  [00:22:27] Speaker 2: It can mean loaded as in have lots of money.  [00:22:29] Speaker 1: Forget that.  [00:22:30] Speaker 3: This is only chapter 2?  [00:22:31] Speaker 2: Why It's they're long chapters. They're they're, like, split up in sub sections.  [00:22:34] Speaker 3: The  [00:22:35] Speaker 1: propaganda was not the same in the past as it is today. And its nature has changed.  [00:22:39] Speaker 2: Like, that last chapter I mean, that yeah, the last chapter had, like, 4 different sections in it. At any time or in any fashion.  [00:22:45] Speaker 1: If ever certain, we  [00:22:46] Speaker 3: knew No kind of again. Could  [00:22:48] Speaker 2: not exist. Yeah.  [00:22:50] Speaker 1: The most obvious of these are accidental or purely historic conditions.  [00:22:54] Speaker 2: Oh my  [00:22:55] Speaker 3: god.  [00:22:56] Speaker 1: Beyond that, it is clear, for example, that the emotions of propaganda is connected with a number of scientists  [00:23:02] User: discovering. No. You're doing we work to  [00:23:05] Speaker 1: Pictures. Are those to produce the means of  [00:23:07] User: They're a king like  [00:23:08] Speaker 1: fish. And  [00:23:09] Speaker 2: And plus I'm laggy here, so I would I would easily will gladly give kills to others. You know, I'm pretty Oh my god. Nipps.  [00:23:14] Speaker 1: It's  [00:23:15] Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Did you see that?  [00:23:17] Speaker 1: For  [00:23:18] User: us. I'm  [00:23:19] Speaker 2: lagging. I didn't even die actually this day. Just letting  [00:23:22] Speaker 1: I  [00:23:23] Speaker 2: got super busy  [00:23:25] Speaker 3: all  [00:23:26] Speaker 2: the  [00:23:27] Speaker 1: fucking time. The findings of social psychology, depth psychology, behaviorism, group sociology, sociology of public opinion, are the very foundations of the propagandist's work. In a different sense, political circumstances Hello,  [00:23:45] Speaker 2: my darling. I wanna wish oh, medical situation. Development of  [00:23:50] Speaker 1: massive problems.  [00:23:52] Speaker 2: Translators not working right, man. Of  [00:23:54] Speaker 1: 1917. Hitler's revolution of 1933 is set  [00:23:56] Speaker 3: Who's calling you darling? For the  [00:23:58] Speaker 2: developed  [00:24:00] Speaker 1: revolutionary  [00:24:01] Speaker 2: friend, sir, re server. I don't fucking know that. Have a good day. No. It's a Surreiber.  [00:24:06] Speaker 3: There  [00:24:07] Speaker 2: you go. That one. The doctor I have a 300 doctor. Yeah. It's a bit  [00:24:12] Speaker 1: dead. Stan's  [00:24:13] Speaker 2: pet. He is one of the people, even armed so disappointed that he would even, like, feed, but he's somebody who stopped feeding in order to be my friend. Like, he doesn't feed anymore. I mean, I felt kinda bad because he did have a good point. He was like, well, what about, like, he's like, well, like I don't know. I I don't know what he said, but it  [00:24:35] Speaker 3: was,  [00:24:36] Speaker 2: made me feel bad kinda because he was like, well, you have  [00:24:38] Speaker 3: a pet.  [00:24:39] Speaker 2: And I'm like, god. Bitch. Oh, I feel embarrassed.  [00:24:41] Speaker 1: Later of the medical life. The SSC political  [00:24:44] Speaker 3: action rather than your  [00:24:46] Speaker 2: pets. You just like, well, you have pets. Like, that's not fair to me. Like, how am I supposed to score and stuff like that? Like by now. Yeah. But you're 42 years old man, Juan. What? And decide  [00:25:01] Speaker 1: you bring rent  [00:25:02] Speaker 2: tomorrow. Something like that. I don't I don't know. For sure how it is. As Leonard is in He lives in Italy too, so translation's always  [00:25:12] Speaker 3: In addition, some  [00:25:13] Speaker 1: movement, we helped the development of propaganda. It learned the verbose, for example, had a genius for it.  [00:25:20] Speaker 2: No. No.  [00:25:21] Speaker 3: Definitely  [00:25:22] Speaker 2: not.  [00:25:23] Speaker 1: Just because they wanted to. They are only the producers and the directors. But Catalyst who  [00:25:28] Speaker 2: profit Oh,  [00:25:30] User: yeah. Okay. So I  [00:25:31] Speaker 2: know what I was thinking. Why was  [00:25:32] Speaker 1: The overall sociological conditions in a society must provide a favorable environment for propaganda. Footnote, the same factors of influence will have different weight and effect this in different contexts.  [00:25:42] Speaker 3: No shit. The  [00:25:43] Speaker 1: media employed against can work only in a particular social  [00:25:46] Speaker 3: structure.  [00:25:47] Speaker 1: This reciprocal influence of propaganda and social structure is precise the and have properly noted that public responses to the impact of propaganda. Have changed considerably in the past few decades and that they change is the result of trends the psychosociological conditions of 20th century  [00:26:02] Speaker 3: 21st century homeboy.  [00:26:04] Speaker 1: Associate conditions. In the industrial society and mass society, Do you find me other glasses? To succeed as  [00:26:09] Speaker 3: 98. A year? Yeah. Mutual  [00:26:11] Speaker 2: I'm like, what the fuck? Wait. What do you  [00:26:13] Speaker 3: mean? I don't get it. Like, it just it just tripped me out because, like,  [00:26:17] Speaker 2: Oh, like, as in they're already 21? They're 26. Yeah. Yeah.  [00:26:21] Speaker 1: Society.  [00:26:22] Speaker 3: In this For 96 will face himself completely 98. Not only I was in Okinawa. Only to find himself trapped in the Super Mario entire society. Super Mario 64 and fucking tiny yet. Structures. All the fucking coins and  [00:26:36] Speaker 1: all the levels. An unstructured mass society.  [00:26:39] Speaker 3: And this kid is, like, just a fucking  [00:26:40] Speaker 1: born. And  [00:26:42] Speaker 3: that was an individual by fucking own one another. No. No. This is just Precisely because the individual Call me out the yard. Other individual. Caught me off guard for sure. Other individual.  [00:26:52] Speaker 1: This  [00:26:53] Speaker 2: is a particular block. It always does indicate the  [00:26:56] Speaker 1: map. Reduced to a  [00:26:57] Speaker 2: side. Whenever she kills  [00:26:59] Speaker 1: you, the fire girl. As soon as local  [00:27:01] Speaker 3: I'm not those who object anymore.  [00:27:02] Speaker 2: No.  [00:27:03] Speaker 1: She's  [00:27:04] Speaker 2: just the chick who, like  [00:27:06] Speaker 3: realistic.  [00:27:07] Speaker 2: Hate me and Gabby.  [00:27:09] Speaker 3: Try  [00:27:10] Speaker 2: to get me banned with feet sleeping. Yeah. Do you Both. What remains in that system? Kind of. I don't know. No. There's a bunch of people who do that, but political parties,  [00:27:18] Speaker 1: unions, and so  [00:27:19] Speaker 2: on. Rebecca is the one that turned in the  [00:27:21] Speaker 1: stations reached  [00:27:22] Speaker 3: out.  [00:27:23] Speaker 2: Banned, and she's tap and go. And the members of this  [00:27:26] Speaker 1: From this perspective, individualist society  [00:27:29] Speaker 3: and We're all the same. We're just corollary of the scripts at the  [00:27:31] Speaker 2: same time. You don't know them, like, at all really. I mean, you are familiar with think  [00:27:34] Speaker 1: Oh, is he,  [00:27:35] Speaker 2: like, impossible to kill? Like, is  [00:27:38] Speaker 3: he fucking he just he's he's just he's just  [00:27:43] Speaker 2: just he's just he's just  [00:27:45] Speaker 1: annoying? Side.  [00:27:47] Speaker 3: We're gonna get We do not I am already  [00:27:49] Speaker 4: a  [00:27:50] Speaker 1: radical individual.  [00:27:51] Speaker 2: Individualism Knowing.  [00:27:52] Speaker 1: Of course, the 2 are not diametrically opposed. Where the greatest value is attributed to the individual, on the  [00:27:55] Speaker 3: basis of  [00:27:57] Speaker 1: society composed in essence only of individuals and therefore one that is not integrated. But all those here in reality are not each total opposition. A great difference nevertheless exists between them. An individualist theory the individual has eminent value Man himself is the master of his life. In individualist reality, each human being is subject to innumerable forces and influences and is not at all matched of his own life. As long as solidly comes I have mass exist. Those who are integrated into the Oh, got  [00:28:27] Speaker 4: a  [00:28:29] Speaker 1: big go.  [00:28:30] Speaker 2: But at the same time, they are protected by them against such external influences as propaganda. Yes. He's right. An individual can be influenced by forces such propaganda only when he is cut off from membership in local group. Mhmm.  [00:28:38] Speaker 4: If  [00:28:40] Speaker 1: such  [00:28:41] Speaker 2: groups are organic Killer. Structured  [00:28:43] Speaker 1: material, spiritual, and emotional. No life. Are not easily penetrated by propaganda. For example, it is much more difficult today for an outside propaganda to influence a soldier, integrated into a military group, or a militant member of a monolithic party than to influence the same man when he is a near citizen. No is the organic group sensitive to psychological disintegration of such small groups. Is their family with the church. Once these groups lost their importance, the individual was left substantially He was plunged into a new environment generally urban and thereby uprooted. He no longer had a traditional place in which to live. And there's no longer geographically attached to a fixed place.  [00:29:15] Speaker 3: Historic  [00:29:16] Speaker 1: to his ancestry. An individual less uprooted can only be part of the  [00:29:19] Speaker 2: motherfucker you don't  [00:29:20] User: Tanya?  [00:29:21] Speaker 1: Jesus. An  [00:29:22] Speaker 3: individualistic king  [00:29:24] Speaker 4: asks if  [00:29:25] Speaker 1: he's something he has never been required to do before, but he the individual, become the measure of all things.  [00:29:30] Speaker 4: Yes. I  [00:29:31] Speaker 1: know. To judge everything for himself. Oh.  [00:29:34] Speaker 4: In  [00:29:35] Speaker 1: fact, he must make  [00:29:36] Speaker 4: his  [00:29:37] Speaker 1: own judgment. Is thrown entirely on his own resources. He can find criteria He's clearly responsible for his  [00:29:42] Speaker 4: own  [00:29:43] Speaker 1: decisions both Why and  [00:29:45] Speaker 3: social. I'm doing  [00:29:46] Speaker 2: It becomes What? You're sitting up. Myself  [00:29:49] Speaker 1: during the day. For him, there was nothing  [00:29:51] Speaker 4: You're sitting  [00:29:52] Speaker 3: up. I said I got some resume and check on the  [00:29:55] Speaker 1: In theory, this is admirable. Line. Uh-huh. Questioning responsibility.  [00:29:59] Speaker 3: Totally didn't even accept the individual's  [00:30:01] Speaker 2: No.  [00:30:02] Speaker 1: The permanent uncertainty social mobility  [00:30:04] User: No. Stop me, dummy. Sociological Stop me.  [00:30:06] Speaker 4: Stop  [00:30:07] Speaker 2: me.  [00:30:08] Speaker 1: Social curve. Becoming easy prey for problems.  [00:30:10] Speaker 4: All the time. And  [00:30:12] Speaker 3: the real See,  [00:30:14] Speaker 1: entire group obeyed. This does not mean that he was freer but only the king determined by his local environment and by his restricted group.  [00:30:21] Speaker 5: Okay. So happy  [00:30:23] Speaker 2: hello, my my dear my dear Lynn. Like, I've been I thought he's like it spells it wrong, like Darlin. But it's just hello? Alright. Hello, my dear.  [00:30:29] Speaker 1: Is one of the reasons why this group is relatively unaffected by propaganda. Gervais himself recognized that  [00:30:34] Speaker 3: the weapons could be  [00:30:35] Speaker 1: reached only if their structure knew you were shut. The difficulties that Leonard experienced in integrating the Russian peasantry into the pattern of the revolution are well known. Thus, here is one of the first conditions for the growth and development of modern propaganda. The emergence in most Europe in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th Precisely because that is when in society  [00:30:54] Speaker 3: That's like  [00:30:55] Speaker 4: super  [00:30:56] Speaker 1: fucking bad. Individualistic and disorganized  [00:30:59] Speaker 4: I  [00:31:00] Speaker 2: doubt it. Or it could be it could be their little big snake server, though. I think that's where it  [00:31:04] Speaker 4: is.  [00:31:05] Speaker 1: Breaking up with his own thing.  [00:31:07] Speaker 3: Cannot be a  [00:31:08] Speaker 1: society about to disappear, which might well be a society  [00:31:10] Speaker 3: Clyde, go lay down. Of breaking up. Now.  [00:31:13] Speaker 1: A society that favors the  [00:31:15] Speaker 3: development  [00:31:16] Speaker 1: must be  [00:31:17] Speaker 4: a society maintaining itself, but at the same time taking on an instructure.  [00:31:20] Speaker 2: No. I don't know how to say that. Suicide. Do  [00:31:23] User: they celebrate Christmas and chicken with Italy? Yeah. Terrible  [00:31:25] Speaker 3: books on the masses. That's where Christianity is,  [00:31:27] Speaker 4: like,  [00:31:29] User: started. Do I look like I am a religious  [00:31:31] Speaker 1: About 90% of the population is politically inert. They become active only accidentally. When they are set into motion. But they are  [00:31:40] User: normally I don't know. I feel like if  [00:31:41] Speaker 2: I don't capitalize  [00:31:43] Speaker 6: If I don't  [00:31:44] Speaker 2: do it and capitalize it, it doesn't, like, do the same. That I  [00:31:48] User: guess they're right. I don't know.  [00:31:49] Speaker 3: No.  [00:31:50] Speaker 1: The relationship between masses and crowds has been much discussed, and distinctions have been between masses and massification.  [00:31:55] Speaker 4: The  [00:31:56] Speaker 1: first is the gathering of a temporary crowd. The second is involvement of individuals in a permanent social cycle. Certainly, a crowd gathered at a different point does  [00:32:01] Speaker 1: not properly Alright.  [00:32:03] Speaker 6: Or whatever.  [00:32:04] Speaker 1: A mass society is a society with considerable population density in which local structures  [00:32:08] Speaker 4: and  [00:32:09] Speaker 1: organizations  [00:32:10] Speaker 4: weak. No. Per  [00:32:11] Speaker 1: Current opinion or  [00:32:13] Speaker 4: strong, we're  [00:32:14] Speaker 1: talking. Men are grouped into a large and influential collective.  [00:32:16] Speaker 2: Where's Boston?  [00:32:17] User: Are you friends here?  [00:32:18] Speaker 2: Right?  [00:32:19] Speaker 0: No. Find out? Yeah. I mean, if there was somebody who I actually, like, even  [00:32:23] Speaker 1: to act on this.  [00:32:24] Speaker 0: I just don't want somebody to be like, In contemporary society, there are Looking at you. The most relation between mass and rock. Because a mass society exists, crowds can gather frequently. It is the individual constantly moves from one crowd to another. From a street crowd to a family What? Or a theater crowd. A subway crowd, a crowd gathered at  [00:32:42] Speaker 2: At least they're not oh.  [00:32:43] Speaker 0: Conversely, the very fact of belonging to  [00:32:46] Speaker 1: being. There is no question demands psychic being is modified by his belonging to a mass society. This modification takes place even if no propaganda appeal is made to the soul of the crowd or the spirit of the collective. This individual produced by a mass society is more readily available. More credulous, more suggestible, more excitable, Under such conditions, propaganda can develop better.  [00:33:07] User: Yeah. Yeah. More news.  [00:33:09] Speaker 1: The Western Europe in the 18th 18th century. In the first half of the 20th, propaganda became possible.  [00:33:15] User: Oh, fuck you. Goddamn it. Nice. I can't believe we got out of that circle  [00:33:20] Speaker 2: like that. So fuck you. Here.  [00:33:23] Speaker 1: More manipulable.  [00:33:24] User: Who said who said 64? Oh, what  [00:33:26] Speaker 2: the fuck?  [00:33:27] Speaker 1: In a primitive society do not permit the player propaganda because they are rigid, stable, and small in number. Their nature is also different. From religious origin, first, they become simple. In the broad sense.  [00:33:38] Speaker 2: Oh, so  [00:33:39] Speaker 1: And that's the sign, finally. Find the maximum deviation between public opinions and late Susie. 1st, the masters in contemporary society.  [00:33:45] Speaker 3: Oh, goddamn. The world. Fact,  [00:33:48] Speaker 1: the propaganda  [00:33:49] User: cannot They lag you here. I can't tell if it's laggy wherever we are. Like, I don't know who this friend is. They changed their name over. Besides, as we  [00:33:54] Speaker 1: have already sworn it out,  [00:33:56] Speaker 3: the main  [00:33:57] Speaker 2: act  [00:33:58] Speaker 1: of creating one of the depend on the existence of the mass. In the United States, these means  [00:34:03] Speaker 3: are  [00:34:04] Speaker 1: called the mass meat to receive propaganda and carry it along, Propaganda is impossible. Must also consider the importance of public opinion in this connection. Public opinion as we presently think of it also needs a mass society. In fact, in the presence of a stimulus or an act, there must be exchanges of opinion.  [00:34:26] Speaker 0: Try it out like Oh, yes. Wonder if you're like a stirrup. Painting for a couple of days to do this bondo and stuff? Mhmm. I left it open just right there.

[00:07:42] Speaker 1: So you leaving home is not gonna prevent this? It's not gonna stop this. It's not gonna reverse this.  [00:07:47] User: Yeah. Exactly. So  [00:07:48] Speaker 1: I'm like, you're gonna have to battle  [00:07:50] Speaker 2: with your own  [00:07:51] Speaker 1: demons over all  [00:07:52] Speaker 2: of this.

As for the rest of the world, you, for example, if you're an elderly person or even young, And you got stage 4 cancer, but you're not ex military or VA. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Sorry. Say hi. Why is it not letting my account? So Brian sent me money right now, but I don't see it. It's not showing up in my account. Really? Okay. I got it. Sorry. Not that much, but whoops. And that's all he has in his cash up. So I  [00:08:42] Speaker 0: Make her comfortable and That's crazy. Finally fast. And a lot of times and we have some patients that family refuses to give them more people or anything else. Right? So they're uncomfortable. They have to engage in a lot because they can't get comfortable enough to just rest. And just sit, you know, So it's kinda like paying somebody away. Right? You can't Yeah. You know, it's kinda like that theory of it all. And we give them a little the morphine we give our patients is so tiniest.  [00:09:11] Speaker 1: amount. How do you get something in a hospital for good somebody to go  [00:09:15] User: yeah.  [00:09:16] Speaker 1: Like, we don't even get  [00:09:18] User: that  [00:09:19] Speaker 1: much.  [00:09:20] User: It's  [00:09:21] Speaker 1: so little. But he was this pay this patient's husband actually passed me, but I thought that that was something that we could give Carol to like, move this along. Don't get me wrong. His  [00:09:30] User: I mean, that's gotta be hard. So  [00:09:32] Speaker 1: tough and valid. She's got full blown Alzheimer's. She hasn't owned years. She's not No. My god. Yeah. That's having hard for real. Yeah. But, like, still, like I should basically lay in there. It's gotta be hot. Yeah. I don't know. That's crazy. So I get his, you know Yeah. I don't think he's, like, fully I don't think he's, like, she was coherent. They would it would never be a question.  [00:10:00] Speaker 0: Which I believe is also financial burden on him because she's in a personal care home, which has been 5,000 a month for. Yeah. And she only had she was at home with Pam. And she fell. And I don't know if after the fell, So it's better now for a night nurse went out to do the assessment and so, I guess, she got up and she was fine and whatever. Well, I went to make a visit the next day because we always do have to have patients to do an assessment.  [00:10:32] Speaker 1: crying out and Like and I was like, no. I was like, mister Jean, we need to get an x-ray. So I called out mobile x-ray. They came out showing up to focus fucking beam. Oh my god. And then I call it back. Call it back and call it back and call it back and see my She was in excruciating pain. I mean, we couldn't give her enough morphine. I gave her morphine every 30 minutes for an hour and a half, and still giving me touch with me. And so finally, I went ahead and called EMS to come to the ER so they can manage her pain. Mhmm. We took off service temporarily. I'll ask this, but they won't take a boat. So they went ahead and did search and then, of course, there was always also that. That she passed away then. So beyond hospital hospital hospital hospital. So we just said when she together. You know? So she's feel properly, all that good stuff. But Now it's 2 months ago now. You know? And she's good. But she's not bad. And we expect that I went after surgery less than a month. Which we all didn't expect her to live. Going on 3 months. Yeah. You know? But still, that's 15,000 dollars just had to come out of pocket. So I get it.  [00:11:37] Speaker 0: Fucking, like, ballistic not even ballistic, but just, like, we're cheering on this fucking person. Which I I'm not gonna lie. I was like, Good for him. I don't know. I mean, sorry. Fuck you. You have any people you're responsible for fucking killing? I mean, they have a 32% denial rate. UnitedHealthcare, I've  [00:11:55] Speaker 0: So 0  [00:11:56] Speaker 1: It was just really I'll tell you a minute. On the same day, this 24 year old white marine dude. Got acquitted for murdering a black man on a subway.  [00:12:06] Speaker 0: We knew what he was doing. He knew what he was doing. You know, to put somebody in a choke hold for that long until his body went limp? Like, if you're just trying to, like, like I think  [00:12:16] Speaker 1: his body was on  [00:12:17] Speaker 0: something. It doesn't matter. That's not a good reason to kill somebody. You still know what he's doing. Understand that. I'm sorry. You think  [00:12:25] Speaker 1: sometimes some of these drugs I get on, it's better. It's rather dark. Some of  [00:12:29] Speaker 0: he's how  [00:12:31] Speaker 1: did you say that guy?  [00:12:32] Speaker 0: Yeah. No. No. I don't know. But maybe this guy was scaring people that way. But, like, but he didn't hurt anybody. He  [00:12:39] Speaker 1: So there were people on the subway car who were just, like, wishing he was being crazy. We you know? Like, they're, like, but at at that time, whenever they were getting the, testimonials from people who saw what happened or whatever, They didn't know that the guy was dead. They just saw that this guy was being crazy and that they he scared them. So they're just, like, defending the white guy kind of it was just like a but are they glad that he's dead? No. Come on.

And doesn't wanna say that I'm right. He won't answer my question, so I didn't answer his question even though that was clearly innocent. Mhmm. Because you're bad at you're bad It will take time.  [00:00:16] Speaker 1: I know. I know. I'm not doing anything that I have to pay attention to. So it's a viral  [00:00:20] Speaker 0: Jelly Roll's speech reflecting on winning best new artist at 39 as proof of hard work in overcome all obstacles. Taps into the familiar cultural narrative, the into a familiar cultural narrative. A bill the belief that feels inspiring, even empowering. But it oversimplifies the complex realities of privilege to systemic barriers and and personal struggle struggle, reducing achievement to individual perseverance, while overlooking the bright of broader forces to shape, broader forces shaping our lives. My own story offers a different perspective on this idea. At 32, I spent much of my life life grappling with societal expectations placed on women, pressures to derive value Either either from adhering to traditional roles as caretakers or from confirm Jesus. Or from conforming to beauty standards. For a long time, I internalized as messages, believing that by fitting into the latter, I could claim the valid opportunities that seemed to surround me in images everywhere. I thought saw it worth by modifying my parents, meeting the world's demands on its And for a while, I found recognition, but it came at the cost of my ability to be able to be recognized by my thoughts, my voice, and my mind. And you're very smart. I was reduced to a role a surface. I was reduced to an, an image, a a product to be consumed as men's entertainment. An idea thought up by man who pro profited immensely off the sexual objectification of women. And men's unnatural and ingrained domination seeking sickness. Living in a society shaped by patriarchal norms, Well, that my choices, especially as a woman, navigating spaces that objectify the the female body came with a stigma and judgment. My value was reduced to how I looked. My and my ideas potential on humanity were often disregarded. Those judgments didn't shaping my opportunities and narrowing my path. Even as I wake up to this reality, as I woke up to this reality, my past was used against me and still is reinforcing the belief reinforcing the belief that I am somehow less than. The idea that success is simply about effort ignores how uneven the playing field is. How do you how do you rise above systemic oppression when your identity is policed? Your labor under valued, and humanity dismissed? Class, race, gender, and countless other constructs don't just determine where we start, but also define the limits on what society allows us to achieve. The myth of hard work as the way to freedom and equality distracts from these dominant realities. Making inequality, despair, and immobility seem like a personal failure. And of a structural one with societal answers. Even after rejecting the commodification of my body and working towards unlearning the idea of the patriarchal world we live in, found that the barriers didn't disappear. System or hadn't disappeared. Living in a system that prioritizes profit over people leaves little space for personal growth or meaningful connection. Freedom, or liberty. Work become survival. Stripped of dignity and fulfillment. We those at the top profit from the exploitation of the vast majority of people. For example, For example, I know I I'm in school. I don't know. But I don't know why I said example, is that for women, especially those with some of the lower classes or impoverished backgrounds. The idea of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps is one of the the starkest examples  [00:05:32] Speaker 1: of how we're tricked into working against our best interests. Despite that, that's not how despite that that's not how boots work. Maybe it would help if the powerful and wealthy also got off our backs. A Jelly Roll story is moving, and his achievements are worth celebrating. That's a wait. Wait. And it but there's an abundance of anecdotal stories told from people with a microphone in a platform that boiled down to those success is proof that anyone can make it through hard work. It's not realistic and actively does harm. It upholds the myth of self made of the self made individual while ignoring the invisible systems of privilege and power that determine who gets ahead and who is left behind. These narratives, even if well intentioned, reinforce the idea that inequality and suffering is personal failing rather than a societal one. Jelly Roll is but one person. The sheer improbability of his achievement becomes apparent when we consider in the US where 11.1 of the population over 36,000,000 people live below the poverty line. Systemic barriers make upward mobility almost impossible. For the majority of people living in poverty or not so well off, the idea that hard work can alone lead to a breakthrough is under mind by limited access to quality education. And opportunity. Jelly Roll is but 0.0000-003% of the population. And 11.1% you're saying can just make it if they try. Like, so I was just saying can make it if they try. Wait. Wait. For the majority of living in poverty are not so well off the idea of how we're at Kalancan can lead to a breakthrough is undermined by limited access to quality education, opportunity, and health care, and other criticalness necessities. But he's just want but one person in the world Or there's even more pronounced globally. We're 1,100,000,000 people or 3.6 percent of the population live in extreme poverty, struggling to meet basic needs like food and shelter. Of course, these are imperialist realities of imposed upon them. Can these people just work hard and change their situations? These figures challenge the notion that success stories I've like jelly rolls are applicable for the average person. Not as yet. If each individual in the US represents 0.0000 3% of the population, the chances of achieving national recognition in any field are but vanishingly small on a global scale where one person accounts for an even tinier fraction. These odds become nearly impossible to grasp. While individual success stories are often celebrated as proof that anyone can overcome hardship, They obscure the reality that systemic inequalities make such outcomes the exception, not the rule of these these numbers illustrate the what is often presented as an inspiring possibility is for the vast majority of people, an unreachable aspiration shaped by the forces far beyond their control. What we need isn't more stories about overcoming systemic barriers, but a reckoning with why those barriers exist in the first place. Uh-huh. Want to live in a world where success doesn't require navigating or surviving oppression, but where the systems that create those struggles are dismantled. A world where our worth isn't tied to how well we perform, within a broken system, how productive we are for the profits of the owner class. But where every person's potential and dignity are honored by Default. And so that world exists stories like jelly rolls served blessed inspiration and more as a tool to instill false a false sense of awareness and the fairy and fairy tale thinking in us. I believe it's just one of the narratives that that we must that must be questioned because it's the only way we only way to make progress in the work and in the work we have to do.

Like, that's not our  [00:05:48] Speaker 3: You  [00:05:49] Speaker 4: know, but you don't really need to say that for the time.  [00:05:52] Speaker 3: I mean, I guess.

The behavioral, cultural, or psycho  [00:03:49] Speaker 6: logical traits typically associated with 1 sex.  [00:03:53] Speaker 3: Yeah. It's yeah. It's associated with your is that  [00:03:55] Speaker 4: definition  [00:03:57] Speaker 5: of  [00:03:58] Speaker 4: sex. Which  [00:04:00] Speaker 6: is  [00:04:01] Speaker 4: the  [00:04:02] Speaker 3: word of sex. So  [00:04:04] Speaker 6: if I look up sex, she said they're the same thing. So if I look up sex, the definition of sex will be the behavioral cultural psychological traits typically associated with one sex. That's what the definition of sex will be.  [00:04:13] Speaker 2: Hello.  [00:04:15] Speaker 5: Oh, so they have different definitions.  [00:04:17] Speaker 3: Go ahead.

I think  [00:04:36] Speaker 4: sex  [00:04:37] Speaker 3: That's the wrong definition, though.  [00:04:39] Speaker 6: How is that the wrong definition? You said I you said Merriam Webster.

I'm  [00:05:05] Speaker 4: not  [00:05:06] Speaker 6: worried about the comments. I'm not worried about anybody else coming in here. I'm worried about you telling me how the definition I provided you how I'm misconstruing that.  [00:05:12] Speaker 4: Bro,  [00:05:13] Speaker 3: how can anybody listen to someone who condone Thomas's behavior? I don't know. I'll ask the question again  [00:05:18] Speaker 4: because we're pivoted. Yeah. Okay. So I'll ask  [00:05:21] Speaker 5: the question again.  [00:05:22] Speaker 4: Oh,  [00:05:23] Speaker 6: okay.

[00:05:56] Speaker 2: Either of  [00:05:58] Speaker 3: the  [00:05:59] Speaker 4: 2 major forms of  [00:06:01] Speaker 3: I have my other point to this. The point is gender  [00:06:03] Speaker 6: Your your your sex a transgender is saying you can change your your sex something conversation  [00:06:07] Speaker 4: whether those are the same definition.  [00:06:09] Speaker 6: No. They're not the same definition. Great. So that would mean that the same  [00:06:13] Speaker 4: gender are right  [00:06:14] Speaker 3: correct.  [00:06:15] Speaker 6: Now that we know that they have 2 different definitions, we know that sex and gender are referring to 2 different things. Correct? You can't change your sex. I'm not did I ever Please explain to me where I said on that list you can change your sex. Go ahead. Point it out to  [00:06:28] Speaker 4: either.  [00:06:29] Speaker 5: Oh, point out to me. Wait.  [00:06:31] Speaker 6: Wait. Hold on.  [00:06:32] Speaker 5: We'll we'll get to that now.  [00:06:34] Speaker 6: I just need to confirm, are sex and gender the same thing? Yes or not?  [00:06:36] Speaker 5: Really, they have 2 different definitions, but they mean 2 different things. You did  [00:06:40] Speaker 4: Dude,  [00:06:41] Speaker 6: You said, yeah. Look it up on Google. I have looked it up on Google. I looked it up in multiple places. I looked it up in biology textbooks and neuroscience textbooks and social sociology textbooks. I've looked it up in a lot of places.  [00:06:51] Speaker 2: Okay? I'm just being transparent. Woman. Hold on. Hold on. So do you need a  [00:06:55] Speaker 6: trans woman again? Use the woman's bathroom. Are we pivoting again to another set of topic? Be handle this one? Do you now wanna move? You wanna wanna move to  [00:07:00] Speaker 3: something else?  [00:07:01] Speaker 6: Not until you conceive to the fact that gender and sex are 2 different things with 2 different meanings. Once you concede, I'll let you move the conversation somewhere else.  [00:07:10] Speaker 4: If you can't, you're  [00:07:11] Speaker 3: all gonna be dead.  [00:07:12] Speaker 6: We know that sex and gender are two Different Now what's beautiful about this now new understanding  [00:07:16] Speaker 5: is we can look at the definition of sex, which is behavioral,  [00:07:19] Speaker 6: cultural, or psychological traits.  [00:07:21] Speaker 5: These would all be societal things. That can change. Behavioral traits can change. Cultural traits can change, and psychological traits can change. We can look at the next word, switches Typically, associated So I love that it says typically because what that tells us is that when I  [00:07:34] Speaker 4: have  [00:07:35] Speaker 3: gender neutral when you have I've been given this feedback. I've gone You have you have conceded  [00:07:40] Speaker 4: Okay?  [00:07:41] Speaker 5: I haven't had  [00:07:42] Speaker 3: any conceded to hold the bait. Oh, I beat you on I'm sorry.  [00:07:46] Speaker 4: You didn't. You didn't.  [00:07:48] Speaker 5: You moved topics because you couldn't handle the conversation. We can go back to it We'll just be back to the same thing, You wanted to move topics. The person who pivots to a new topic is not the person who  [00:07:52] Speaker 6: Fun fact.  [00:07:53] Speaker 4: Okay. So  [00:07:54] Speaker 5: keep your knickers on.  [00:07:56] Speaker 4: No. I  [00:07:57] Speaker 3: just wanna destroy you on all of the  [00:07:59] Speaker 4: 7 top Big  [00:08:01] Speaker 5: We'll prove I'll prove to you that you're wrong about everything else if you wanna go there. But you need to stop pivoting.  [00:08:05] Speaker 4: Okay?  [00:08:06] Speaker 6: You wanna talk to the comments, we'll turn the comments off. I don't care about the comments.  [00:08:09] Speaker 4: Yeah.  [00:08:10] Speaker 3: I'm gonna hold whatever it is.  [00:08:12] Speaker 4: Yeah.  [00:08:13] Speaker 3: Great.  [00:08:14] Speaker 5: Now, again, we know that sex and gender are two different things. We know that is typically related to social things such as behavioral cultural, or psychological traits. And we know that gender is only typically associated with specific sexes. What does the word typically mean? Usually, Okay. So does that mean there's an atypical? Yes or no?  [00:08:28] Speaker 4: Yes.  [00:08:29] Speaker 3: Great.  [00:08:31] Speaker 5: So trans people would be the atypical. They are have they have these behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits, but they're not associated with that sex. They're associated with the other sex.  [00:08:39] Speaker 3: And that that that that's where that's where this comes in. That's a mental disorder. That's not that's not a real thing that's happening to them. That's a good  [00:08:45] Speaker 6: that's a mental disorder.  [00:08:47] Speaker 3: And them having that type of those problems in their mind, and there's plenty of  [00:08:50] Speaker 4: Okay.  [00:08:51] Speaker 3: Sam have  [00:08:52] Speaker 4: me the evidence.  [00:08:54] Speaker 3: Yeah. Absolutely.  [00:08:55] Speaker 4: One second.  [00:08:56] Speaker 3: Yeah. And it's literally called gender dysphoria, buddy.  [00:08:59] Speaker 6: So being trans does not mean you have gender dysphoria.  [00:09:02] Speaker 3: Yes. It does.  [00:09:04] Speaker 2: Nope.  [00:09:05] Speaker 6: Want me to go to the American psycho psychiatric association, people created gender  [00:09:10] Speaker 5: dysphoria, the people who created that diagnosis and read you what they have to say about gender dysphoria?  [00:09:14] Speaker 4: No. I can do  [00:09:15] Speaker 3: that myself.  [00:09:16] Speaker 5: Oh, okay. So you don't want to. So you don't wanna read the part where they say under genitals for you. That only some people who are transgender will experience gender  [00:09:24] Speaker 4: dysphoria.  [00:09:26] Speaker 3: I mean, that  [00:09:27] Speaker 4: Yeah.  [00:09:28] Speaker 5: I'm dating the people that created the diagnosis and reading you what they have to say about the diagnosis of gender.  [00:09:32] Speaker 3: How do you think there's confusion there? I agree. This people who created the diagnosis,  [00:09:36] Speaker 6: we're  [00:09:37] Speaker 4: not gonna  [00:09:38] Speaker 3: pin it again.  [00:09:39] Speaker 5: People who created the diagnosis of gender dysphoria have literally said that not all trans people have it. So if you wanna concede to this, if you wanna keep going  [00:09:47] Speaker 4: down this path,  [00:09:48] Speaker 6: Sure can't wait for this.  [00:09:49] Speaker 4: So  [00:09:50] Speaker 5: is to show me where the American Psychiatric Association  [00:09:53] Speaker 4: Diagnosis.

[00:00:51] Speaker 0: It was an extremely positive message. keep trying. keep plugging away at it. keep chopping that tree to come down type shit. that's fine. i'm just  [00:01:03] Speaker 2: Trying to tell you my take on it. does it matter to you that i have a take on it? no. it doesn't matter to you. no. let's see what the fuck  [00:01:15] Speaker 0: I'm saying, ashley. i just don't, i just don't like... i  [00:01:19] Speaker 2: Literally just tried to talk to you about something. i have a take on it. why is it making you upset? i'm not trying to make you upset. i'm not trying to fight with you.  [00:01:30] Speaker 2: the is that is that whether or not it's a positive You see anybody who says just have to try hard and don't make it is the same it's it's the same thing. As, like, believing in the American dream. Well, no. Some people are trying really hard, and they can't make they can't make the most basic, like, they can't meet the most their most, like, basic human beings. And that's  [00:01:56] Speaker 0: I'm not trying to make you upset.  [00:01:58] Speaker 0: Okay. So they basically just positive. I understand that, but I have a different take on that message.  [00:02:05] Speaker 2: So then personal efforts is not the question here. It's the weight on people's necks and backs that are put on them on purpose in order for some people to benefit. That is the problem. It's not people's effort. People are putting an effort. Nobody said that that's a bad thing. But there has to be some sort of, like it's not just the person individual person's responsibility or like, ability to do anything. Doesn't matter how trap met people try. They'll never they never get out of where they are. So  [00:02:39] Speaker 1: on  [00:02:40] Speaker 2: purpose,  [00:02:41] Speaker 1: and  [00:02:42] Speaker 2: that's how the system is designed. So it doesn't matter how hard people try. And I think I think personal effort does make a difference. The okay. Did you hear me? Yeah. I did hear you. Do you disagree with the fact that no. I don't have poverty. That do you disagree with me that the people in poverty are in poverty because of the wealth that some people have? No. I do not disagree with that. Okay  [00:03:09] Speaker 3: do you do you think that you personally is it doesn't matter the effort that you put in, you're always gonna be the same place. I'm I'm just I'm I'm asking, like,  [00:03:16] Speaker 1: then.  [00:03:17] Speaker 2: I think I have done plenty to, like, what what do you mean? Are you saying you don't work hard?  [00:03:22] Speaker 3: No. I'll I'll I'm asking you. Do you see think that despite your work your work ethic, your level of involvement or whatever, do you think despite despite any of that, no matter how high or low, that you're gonna stay in the same position?  [00:03:39] Speaker 2: I am right now, Brian. I'm 33  [00:03:42] Speaker 2: I you think I don't work hard here?  [00:03:45] Speaker 2: the fuck is. Stop. I'm just trying to make a point.  [00:03:49] Speaker 3: I'm asking you, you personally.  [00:03:51] Speaker 4: And  [00:03:52] Speaker 3: you're saying. I'm asking if you believe that your work ethic and your fucking level of for, like, your level of how hard you work, do you think that that matters? Do do you think that despite either of that that you were gonna stay in the same spot, like, economic because  [00:04:11] Speaker 3: almost. I'm 36.  [00:04:13] Speaker 2: Okay. Look where I am. What do you mean?  [00:04:15] Speaker 3: I'm  [00:04:16] Speaker 3: I don't  [00:04:18] Speaker 4: there's not much  [00:04:20] Speaker 2: I'm okay. And you should know the answer to that, though. Like, I don't understand what you're  [00:04:24] Speaker 2: that's  [00:04:25] Speaker 4: I don't  [00:04:26] Speaker 2: care about making money. Okay? I just want I want if it were up to me, I would not be doing this piece of shit fucking job. I would be doing something that actually helps people and contributed  [00:04:39] Speaker 0: To just be more productive when they don't even fucking raise our wages. That's my take on it. I'm sorry. I don't think that everybody can make it because, like, you agree with me saying that there has to be these people in publishing order for them to be equal and to for the people to be wealthy. That's wealthy as they are. So if you agree with me there, then I don't understand how you can say that just anybody can make  [00:05:06] User: I'm not talking about just us individually, but I I gotta go.  [00:05:10] Speaker 2: Love you too.  [00:05:12] Speaker 1: it. I've never said just anybody can make it. But  [00:05:15] Speaker 0: what we're talking about.  [00:05:17] Speaker 1: Hi.  [00:05:18] Speaker 1: I'm talking about, like, no fucking  [00:05:20] User: Are you a  [00:05:21] Speaker 1: booty?

Totally unqualified. Try to support these candidates, not for them per se, but because if we can sell and then we lost 2 others that we covered last week. But this week marks a shift where they realize that this process has not gone that well. Now scholars  [00:00:24] Speaker 1: It's  [00:00:25] Speaker 2: getting chilly  [00:00:26] User: No. I'm not waiting. I saw this. So my hand can't stay in the  [00:00:28] Speaker 3: jar.

[00:01:35] Speaker 1: I  [00:01:36] Speaker 3: think.  [00:01:37] Speaker 1: Somebody said that this like, in Does this happen? After the CEO killing, somebody commented and said this needs to be the new norm. Eat the  [00:01:42] Speaker 3: rich.  [00:01:43] Speaker 2: So  [00:01:44] Speaker 3: Normally,  [00:01:45] Speaker 1: funny because that's what the US calls all other governments that we don't like.  [00:01:48] Speaker 3: That's like the Hello?  [00:01:49] Speaker 1: Yes. Or us going Something when we go overseas to fucking, like, people. It's called, spreading democracy whenever people whenever when other people that we don't like  [00:01:55] Speaker 3: do  [00:01:56] Speaker 1: it, it's,  [00:01:57] User: terrorism.  [00:01:58] Speaker 1: Yeah. What? I don't know. Okay. So so far, man. Yeah.  [00:02:02] Speaker 0: I don't know how that stuff works on this stuff.  [00:02:04] Speaker 1: No. There's not. A contaminant got into it or the ship was totally  [00:02:06] Speaker 0: a combinations? But it's definitely not old. So Miss Lisa, only 1 president at the top.  [00:02:10] Speaker 1: And  [00:02:11] Speaker 2: just an interesting you know, as we started on this podcast, I'm just observing how people are largely I don't know what the impact is. I, again, She did  [00:02:15] Speaker 1: this this this weekly During his first presidency, She just goes I mean, I don't know if this is kinda weird that, like, She got that. There was a she needed to stop the list after Biden was president. I looked like things were way back over wet. To a normal from a normal quote unquote whatever.  [00:02:24] Speaker 0: But now she started it She's on week 5 already. She started it now again. She brought I mean,  [00:02:29] Speaker 1: I think it's like I  [00:02:30] Speaker 0: think it  [00:02:31] Speaker 1: literally is  [00:02:32] Speaker 0: just what she's covering is, like, not normal. Not that not that normal is okay. Either though. Like, because she is she lists she talks about the things that went on that don't normally happen, whether or not they're good or bad to happen the way that they do. The fact that it's, like, 20 times worse when, like, the way he's doing hired all of his fucking family members and put them in positions and,  [00:02:40] Speaker 2: Government. And, he gave his he he gave all of his or, like, gave them the whatever it's called, the  [00:02:44] Speaker 3: Pass them  [00:02:45] Speaker 1: down?  [00:02:46] Speaker 2: Not passed him down, but gave the, the the responsibility. I don't know. I forgot what it's called right now. Foxy or whatever? No. Just like his business  [00:02:50] Speaker 3: is.  [00:02:51] Speaker 2: His business or, like, just his Trump businesses or whatever. He gave all of that. Because you can't have business that being a president. Apparently. Like, not like that. Mhmm. Especially, like, the businesses or his Mar a Lago's. I don't even know how that's business. I guess it's just because it's their golf course. I think that's his main one, but it's because  [00:02:59] Speaker 3: Right. You see how the spokes just, like, flowing down? Yeah.  [00:03:01] Speaker 1: I thought  [00:03:02] Speaker 3: that was really cool. Sorry. I'm  [00:03:04] Speaker 1: married. That's  [00:03:05] Speaker 3: fine.  [00:03:06] Speaker 4: Oh, yeah. He gave it out to basically, he gave it to his son.  [00:03:08] Speaker 2: He gave it all he gave the fund the responsibility or the the position the president I don't know what it's called. CEO  [00:03:12] Speaker 1: ship?  [00:03:13] Speaker 2: Yeah.  [00:03:14] Speaker 1: Sure.  [00:03:15] Speaker 2: The the the the acting responsibility, whatever person of his business is to his son, who has, written a new a new not so not so front not so anti, foreign government Strict. So basically, more friendly to government to foreign interference, and in, financial dealings. Like  [00:03:22] Speaker 5: Like, he's  [00:03:23] Speaker 2: written some new policy. Big because the policy before was basically, like,  [00:03:27] Speaker 0: We're still gonna get that from the weekly kicks and when and then, my thinking is part of the reason Trump picked Marco Rubio because of their state was to Florida as we started off the meeting, we thought it was important.

I don't know if it's I think it is specific  [00:07:17] Speaker 5: to  [00:07:18] Speaker 3: well, wealth is power, so I don't know. But, yeah, basically, it's it's where people don't don't know what it's like to be any but rich, and then they just,  [00:07:22] Speaker 4: like,  [00:07:23] Speaker 3: all of this shit without having to work for it, and then they get in positions of power specifically, I guess. I don't know.  [00:07:27] Speaker 5: All of a sudden, it's too big.  [00:07:28] Speaker 3: Yep.  [00:07:29] Speaker 1: They  [00:07:30] Speaker 4: disconnected.  [00:07:31] Speaker 7: Last week, but this week, it's gotten that much worse. You mentioned Laura Trump.  [00:07:33] Speaker 8: Selected  [00:07:34] Speaker 4: What the fuck? It's so crazy.  [00:07:36] Speaker 3: You guys chick is crazy.  [00:07:37] Speaker 7: Social life.  [00:07:38] Speaker 1: Wait. What? I don't know.  [00:07:39] Speaker 4: There you  [00:07:40] Speaker 8: go.  [00:07:41] Speaker 4: There you  [00:07:42] Speaker 7: go. There you go. Thanks  [00:07:43] Speaker 9: to the d d here. All lines of water. I didn't I didn't conflicts of interest, not only with the Trump I didn't hear it well enough.  [00:07:46] Speaker 4: Maybe maybe maybe I'm on  [00:07:48] Speaker 7: with another woman, socialite, and so Oh, okay. Her file profile 2  [00:07:51] Speaker 8: b  [00:07:52] Speaker 7: a ambassador to Greece. Reporting indicates it's also the same day that his son was openly in public with another woman socializing, didn't work that he's having to prepare with, maybe drunk wants to shoot to another country, but it is still keeping it in the family. Also, reporting this week, that the Trump Organization, which is now led by Eric Trump, will issue will sign up a court limited ethics pledge. This second regime so the company can profit before it  [00:08:01] Speaker 1: deals  [00:08:02] Speaker 7: including the countries that are essential to US foreign policy interests. So major theme of these bullets  [00:08:05] Speaker 5: So is that that's immediately contradictory to the tariffs and shit  [00:08:07] Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, yeah. Of  [00:08:09] Speaker 4: course, Sam.

I don't know. Saying it was put there to disrupt foreign trade is the right way to put it.  [00:08:22] Speaker 3: I mean, just a fearmonger about, like, other countries, China, whatever, and, like, acting like you know, tariffs on them. But, no, it's just gonna be more expensive for the unit for people in the United States.  [00:08:27] User: For regular people.  [00:08:28] Speaker 5: I got  [00:08:29] Speaker 3: it. Hi.

[00:08:58] Speaker 6: I  [00:08:59] Speaker 4: don't know.  [00:09:00] Speaker 1: I  [00:09:01] Speaker 3: mean, this is do it a lot, but also that thing is pretty  [00:09:02] Speaker 8: on there  [00:09:03] Speaker 3: That orange thing, that's pretty hard to get off. I don't know when the what the best way to pull it is, and I haven't tried that  [00:09:06] User: thing yet.  [00:09:07] Speaker 3: Put this thing right here.  [00:09:08] Speaker 5: Is that how you're  [00:09:09] Speaker 6: supposed to use it? Do  [00:09:10] Speaker 3: I don't know. There's a you can use it I guess, multiple ways, but the way I saw them do it  [00:09:12] Speaker 5: Like that?  [00:09:13] Speaker 3: No. You're supposed to pull it out. I think. Like, you could put your fingers in between it or you could put, like, a hook then then pull that way? But,  [00:09:16] Speaker 2: yeah, When  [00:09:17] Speaker 5: you pull it it out as in  [00:09:18] Speaker 6: Pull it out  [00:09:19] Speaker 5: in  [00:09:20] Speaker 8: the  [00:09:21] Speaker 5: direction  [00:09:22] Speaker 8: you need to pull it  [00:09:23] Speaker 4: out.  [00:09:24] Speaker 5: Okay. Yeah. So, like, if you need to come up, I  [00:09:25] Speaker 1: pulled it. Mhmm.  [00:09:26] Speaker 5: Well, I  [00:09:27] Speaker 4: wedged  [00:09:28] Speaker 1: it.  [00:09:29] Speaker 3: I know. I saw. Okay. But you but by doing that, you kind of took away the, the Like, you just basically pulled it off from one side to from the other. So it kinda took away the whole, like, The  [00:09:34] Speaker 8: power. Its  [00:09:35] Speaker 3: function. Yeah. The way it functions.  [00:09:37] Speaker 6: Is cool?  [00:09:38] Speaker 5: It's, like, you can read me blue  [00:09:39] Speaker 3: I just started  [00:09:40] Speaker 8: this again.  [00:09:41] User: Well,  [00:09:42] Speaker 1: I  [00:09:43] Speaker 3: somewhere. Somewhere, like, like, there around the same area. I didn't move it off. It's like Oh, my bad.  [00:09:45] Speaker 1: Okay. You can't  [00:09:46] Speaker 8: do that.  [00:09:47] Speaker 3: Is there a good chance that I'll dry? I got  [00:09:48] User: cheese, cream cheese and  [00:09:49] Speaker 3: salsa on the hood.  [00:09:50] Speaker 1: Hello?  [00:09:51] Speaker 1: A woman spreads her Because she willingly spread spread her legs, bro.  [00:09:54] Speaker 8: And  [00:09:55] Speaker 4: she just gave it to me. Wow.  [00:09:56] Speaker 10: She gave it up that easy. Man. Now she's think she  [00:09:58] Speaker 1: had she just never showed up with her body, but she's not in her salon for it. She can't get an abortion because she should deal with the consequences of having of spreading her legs. Okay. I mean, that's a moral She loses the right to control her body from committing a thing that's not a crime. I mean, it turned out she would only spread her legs if she didn't wanna have it if she didn't wanna have a baby, she should've, told the guy to wear a condom or get a get a plan b. She was embarrassed as possible. So so she thinks he could just kill the That that that that that their mom was irresponsible. Wanted that failed  [00:10:04] Speaker 3: Her mom. It's like a it's  [00:10:05] Speaker 4: like a like a an amoeba. That's the and it's a mom. It's it's mom.  [00:10:07] Speaker 1: No. Sex isn't a crime, but this is what she was doing. She was doing is wrong to this and a lot of other people. I don't care if it's wrong to you. And if you Any more blame there? Same thing. No. My morals I'm sorry.  [00:10:09] Speaker 8: I  [00:10:10] Speaker 5: have My morals are much  [00:10:11] Speaker 10: better  [00:10:12] Speaker 5: than yours.  [00:10:13] Speaker 6: You are making a a claim that this thing shouldn't be the case You shouldn't be allowed to do this, which would be a legal way. You as a liberal me as  [00:10:15] Speaker 1: a republican, and you're saying you have  [00:10:16] Speaker 6: more morals than me. Get Absolutely. I don't think that the whole show is the right to their body. I think that would be a moral in something that's morally unjust, especially if they don't commit a crime.  [00:10:20] Speaker 0: How far in the pregnancy do you believe, you can have an abortion you can have an abortion anytime after 24 weeks. It has to be a non lethal method of abortion, such as a hesterotomy or an induction abortion. Bro, I just I just can't believe man. Like,  [00:10:30] Speaker 1: if What? If if you're gonna  [00:10:32] Speaker 0: if you're gonna don't have answers to questions, you got to laugh. No. No. I have an answer to you, but I have an answer to you. Because you have more man. You didn't answer the question that I asked 5 minutes ago.  [00:10:34] Speaker 2: Yeah. Go ahead. I'll wait. I'll give you I'll give you a direct answer. Oh, cool.  [00:10:36] Speaker 0: What other time do we lose the right to the autonomy of our body to get dig dictate what we do with our bodily resources when we don't commit  [00:10:42] Speaker 2: a crime?  [00:10:43] Speaker 0: Say what? Say what?  [00:10:44] Speaker 2: He said if they if they get raped, then they're not choosing to have a to have sex. So, therefore, right? Is that what you said? Our  [00:10:47] Speaker 1: demons. We  [00:10:48] Speaker 3: You you said that even if they're raped, they were sexually assaulted. They should still  [00:10:50] Speaker 2: But his, his the inconsistency is that he was blaming women who choose to have sex, so they should choose, the so they should have to deal with the consequences. What about in the case of rape where they're not choosing to have sex? Should they also have to deal with the consequences? Consequences? Because that's yeah. Nothing. Like,  [00:10:56] Speaker 1: doesn't know what's going on. There's no knowing for that thing.  [00:10:59] Speaker 2: What do you mean just a fucking act with your husband or something? You got some  [00:11:01] Speaker 1: hit on accident.  [00:11:02] Speaker 3: Cooking tops like  [00:11:03] Speaker 2: that? Yeah. Must have been,  [00:11:04] Speaker 3: like, fucking damaged  [00:11:06] Speaker 4: by us. We get some shit. Like  [00:11:07] Speaker 2: No. Or  [00:11:08] Speaker 4: For for for  [00:11:09] Speaker 3: someone  [00:11:10] Speaker 4: to  [00:11:11] Speaker 3: that fucking kind of mentality  [00:11:12] Speaker 2: He's also very young and probably just watching Andrew Tate. That's probably what it could be. I mean, it doesn't have to be, like, a reason for people to to treat women like that. What do you mean? It have to be because  [00:11:14] Speaker 4: a  [00:11:15] Speaker 1: woman did something that  [00:11:16] Speaker 4: garnered  [00:11:17] Speaker 1: it?  [00:11:18] Speaker 2: There's plenty of,  [00:11:19] Speaker 1: like,  [00:11:20] Speaker 2: I mean, reasons why people end up like  [00:11:21] Speaker 1: that. I mean, just look at the way just look at grand theft auto or these, like, these things that influence people to act like that. That could be definitely be the reason or how violence is part so much of part of, like, masculinity and the way it's, like, shown that, like, to everyone. It's like you're  [00:11:25] Speaker 4: not  [00:11:26] Speaker 3: alive because,  [00:11:27] Speaker 2: but  [00:11:28] Speaker 4: What do  [00:11:29] Speaker 5: you mean we're  [00:11:30] Speaker 3: sensitive?  [00:11:31] Speaker 1: Sorry. I'm not I was not really looking at that just to  [00:11:32] Speaker 3: see.  [00:11:33] Speaker 2: My  [00:11:34] Speaker 1: tone was not towards you. It was just my  [00:11:35] Speaker 4: my  [00:11:36] Speaker 1: annoyance of that kind of stuff, like,  [00:11:37] Speaker 2: Oh, there's my jacket. Isn't it cold cold outside?  [00:11:39] Speaker 3: It's it's That's kind of a weird argument, but I think it's  [00:11:41] Speaker 5: very  [00:11:42] Speaker 4: now.  [00:11:43] Speaker 1: I mean, I have to think about it more. Is is there a different argument that's for sure. Yeah. But,  [00:11:46] Speaker 2: yeah,  [00:11:47] Speaker 1: I  [00:11:48] Speaker 2: feel like there could be, like, a  [00:11:49] Speaker 1: something to be like, well, that's not comparable for just for that reason. But I mean, it's not These kids not gonna have the thing to say back to it. That's for sure.  [00:11:52] Speaker 3: Some sort of decision or action.  [00:11:53] Speaker 3: Persons. 32.9 deaths. So every every 100 That's that's not true.  [00:11:56] Speaker 1: What?  [00:11:57] Speaker 3: So so you think the CDC is lying with us?  [00:11:59] Speaker 5: Absolutely.  [00:12:00] Speaker 3: Why? Why would  [00:12:01] Speaker 1: maybe maybe because  [00:12:02] Speaker 2: or  [00:12:03] Speaker 1: my god. That's stupidest part. I was  [00:12:04] Speaker 2: just basically I I really wanted to  [00:12:05] Speaker 3: make sure that before we continue I was talking to somebody who is smart, and I guess I  [00:12:07] Speaker 4: wasn't. Uh-huh.  [00:12:08] Speaker 3: Smart people don't have time to multiple things you multiple of your own logic. You backpedaled on your own logic. You don't believe the CDC's number on maternal mortality even though they're the ones who track that shit. You believe that you value potential over somebody who's currently selling? More logic.  [00:12:10] Speaker 2: Did you find here why you lost  [00:12:11] Speaker 3: Why do the people who don't have consensual sex lose control of their body?  [00:12:13] Speaker 5: Because there's a such thing as adoption.  [00:12:14] Speaker 3: Answer. That's not an answer. Your claim is that the reason they can't have an abortion is they spread their  [00:12:16] Speaker 5: legs  [00:12:17] Speaker 3: So when someone doesn't spread their legs, it would  [00:12:20] Speaker 1: that that  [00:12:21] Speaker 6: It's like  [00:12:22] Speaker 7: I don't know. Whatever. I'm talking  [00:12:23] Speaker 6: destroy you.  [00:12:24] Speaker 4: Double down on his own fucking stupidity. Hold  [00:12:25] Speaker 5: on. I'm talking to the same person that thinks a naturally born male It can be a female. That that that so I'm talking about No. That's that's  [00:12:28] Speaker 2: That was so fucking decent. Like, that's so different, didn't you? Saying  [00:12:30] Speaker 3: male and female on this list.

And based on one of the for multiple of the sub information, or the context that's said about it. I guess they're called properties. Based on 1 or 2 properties, the other properties it contains may be different. Or include more than others. For example, if we had an end to the property would be the, sorry, the type of property would be would be person, and based on that being person, it would have other properties such as position or role, and it would list under those.   [00:00:42] Speaker 1: A   [00:00:43] Speaker 0: A politician a politician, which would be indicated by, like, a category, property, it would say politician, based on the fact that she was a politician, it could have other properties underneath Kamala Harris that are something like significant, policy or legislation or significant actions made as vice president something like that. the Black lives matter.

**Title:** Issues in American Policing and Systemic Racism

**Overview:** The conversation discusses various issues related to American policing, including the lack of constitutional duty to protect citizens, high rates of police killings, and mass incarceration, particularly affecting Black Americans. It highlights systemic racism, civil asset forfeiture, deputy gangs, and misconduct, including sexual offenses and domestic violence among officers. The conversation also touches on the legal doctrines like qualified immunity that protect police misconduct and suggests alternative approaches to public safety that focus on equity and basic needs provision.

And when the police aren't busy avoiding responsibility and accountable the supreme court made the common police mission statement to protect and serve a mere PR slogan. Ruling in Warren v District of Columbia the court determined that police have no constitutional duty to protect even in emergencies. Guarding with me and the police have to do so, then every public official would also have to do the same. An illogical and stupid train of thought. Already in this video, I've mentioned the instances of America police needlessly murdering citizens at the slightest provocation. Or lack of a better term, It should be no surprise then that American police kill more than any other so called developed nations law enforcement. Between 2014 and 2016 alone, over 1,000 police killings were reported annually with black Americans disproportionately represented among the victims. So much so in fact that getting killed while police is a leading cause of death for young black men in America. This isn't an aberration as I talked about in my 13 50 percent video here. Black people are treated like an occupied colonial population within the US, Just to give you an idea of how bad the problem is in a single statistic, black teenagers are 21 times more likely than their white peers to be killed by police. Remind me again, who has a target on their back? It's definitely not the cops. These killings occur within the broader context of mass incarceration I also touched on in the previous video mentioned. So I'll just highlight some statistics. The United States currently imprisons 2,000,000 people, more people than in any other country and 25% of the world's incarcerated population despite only being 4% of the global population. The US across China with well over 4 times the population. Incarcerates approximately 1,690,000 people. This means China's incarceration rate is a 119,400,000. Russia, another US enemy accused of unconstrained of authoritarianism, holds 433,000. Russia's incarceration rate is 450 per 100,000. Speaking of prisons, policies like war on drugs have been central to the explosion of America's incarcerated population. Between 1985 and 2000, sentences for nonviolent to drug offenses nearly doubled, contributing to a 66% increase in the state prison population. Likewise, a boom for private prisons. By 2000, over 1,000,000 black adolescents had a parent in prison. All of this sounds like institutional racism. Right? Well, that's because it is. It's the other major defining feature of American policing. Black and brown communities are over policed and subjected to invasive often violent encounters, something else I've covered in-depth in my 13 50 percent video. There's sadly a lot of overlap that just tends to happen with intersectional problems. Since you see more detail on that video, I want to highlight something I didn't mention there. Even those of higher class positions, prominent figures like Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Junior, have been a victim of this insanity. The man was arrested in his own home after being reported by a neighbor as a burglar. Despite proving via his driver's license that it was his house. The cops didn't believe him because he was black. But what about to call the diverse police forces? Do they do better? The short answer is no. Departments with diverse personnel continue to enforce policies like stop and risk and aggressive drug enforcement. Which disproportionately targets the online communities. This proves or at least strongly supports the idea that there's a broader systemic ideology that views poor and otherwise marginalized populations as threats to be controlled instead of people to be helped. Let's talk about the non lethal corruption the police get up to. Legal theft by police, aka civil asset forfeiture, is a predatory state sponsored practice that is pretty popular within US law enforcement. The US publishes reports about all the stuff, and I took look at just 2 categories for the most recent data available, which is last year. Here it is. Police seized 76,800 items valued at $6,000,000,000 with an additional $106,000,000 in forfeited property. This brought the total value of seized and forfeited property to over $6,100,000,000 It's almost certainly worse than this, but even this is a staggering amount. These assets are often taken from individuals who are never charged with a crime and disproportionate affect working class and marginalized communities. Yes. There's the occasional drug kingpin bust or whatever, but these are rare. In many cases, deceased property includes cash or vehicles and even homes, forcing people into expensive legal battles to reclaim their belongings. Though legal theft isn't the only crime the police get up to. In the Los Angeles County, they've taken organized police crime to the next level. Gangs. I mean gang units, Southern groups of police societies specifically deal with gang violence. I mean, gangs of police that have a structure and purpose similar to those on the outside of the law, so to speak. LA County has at least 10 known deputy gangs with names like the reefers, regulators, jump out boys, executioners, benditos, and the Vikings, incredibly stupid names. These gangs have operated within the sheriff's department for at least 50 years. These gangs enforce illegal arrest quotas, tally it against officers who refuse to comply celebrate violence they commit with tattoos and parties. For example, deputy Miguel Vega fatally shot 18 year old Andres Huerta while allegedly attempting to impress the executioners and earn their signature sculpt and tattoo. Since 2010, so called misconduct in any wild crime linked to these deputy gangs have Los Angeles over $21,000,000 in settlements. Whistleblowers have testified about the gang's extensive influence, oversight bodies report continued failures to investigate discipline or fire members.  [00:36:45] Speaker 1: So  [00:36:46] Speaker 2: 2 missed contact mostly, unfortunately, is, of course, another pervasive issue in policing, victims are more often than not under 18. Not that I make it okay had they been over 18, but I'm making a point. Between 2005 and 2007 alone, 548 officers were arrested for sex related crime. Crimes, with 56% of these offenses occurring on duty. So basically, citizens paid cops to kids, 37% of the victims were between 13-15 years old. And 12% for 12 or younger. According to investigation by the Washington Post, per 2005, according to 1,008 high officers in charge of crimes involving child sexual abuse. Many avoid punishment, due to box investigations, reduced charges, and leniently yield. Domestic violence among police officers also reflects the culture of conflict aggression. Service police officers themselves show that 40% of them admitted to physically abusive their spouses in the past year at the time of survey. 3% in all events this year violence  [00:38:20] Speaker 1: that  [00:38:21] Speaker 2: is.  [00:38:22] Speaker 1: These  [00:38:23] Speaker 2: race particularly in drug and weapons cases. Where is more people in LA? Officers flying to drugs on 2 individuals in the profession leading to wrongful convictions and prison sentences. Over 200 convictions were overturned as a result of the scandal. So how do these assholes keep getting away with murder? This does to the major factors, but these by no means 27 by government officials acting in good faith on civil liability. In 1982, the US Supreme Court expanded the scope of the doctrine by removing the subjective good faith requirement arguing that litigating an officer's intentions created excessive costs on distracted officers from their duties. How is never really explained. There's just a vibe, I guess. This objective standard allows officers to avoid liability unless their actions violate clearly established constitutional rights. Term defined so narrowly that the courts often grant immunity even in cases of severe misconduct. For instance, a social worker accused of sexual harassment was granted immunity because I swear I'm not making this up, the court reason that the plaintiff's 14th amendment right to be free from sexual harassment by a social worker worker was not clearly established at the time of the alleged misconduct. This is in spite of the fact that sexual harassment was also against the department's internal policy and the law. These doctrines impact this staggering Between 1982 and 2018, supreme court upheld qualified immunity in 28 of 30 cases, reversing most lower court decisions that denied immunity. As a result, fewer than 1% of victims pursue lawsuits since early dismissal is all but guaranteed. Even in the rare cases they reach the supreme court, victims rarely succeed with decisions consistently favoring officers and their so called adjutant. Courts on this matter at least are the biggest impediment to meaningful change in the legal system. While qualified immunity provides a legal cover for misconduct, the blue wall of silence, as it's known, ensures cultural protection by discouraging officer from snitching on their fellow officers. They frequently describe their relationships as familial, emphasizing loyalty to their brothers in blue, again, more cringe. Not sure I could do a better job explaining that than some graffiti at the NYPD Academy. The commissioner is the mayor's puppet. Mayor doesn't care for us. Media puts us down and the public hates us. All we have is each other. Stick together.  [00:42:03] Speaker 1: That  [00:42:04] Speaker 2: loyalty is not just expected amongst beers, but also directed upwards. With officers refraining from actions that could harm their superiors' interests. This, of course, strengthens the culture of silence. Creates a feedback loop where misconduct is protected, normalized, and perpetuated. The consequences of breaking the silence are severe and far reaching. Whistleblowers face ostracism, harassment, and retaliation, including undesirable assignments, fabricated misconduct charges, stalled career progression or even violence, physical and psychological intimidation, substance property damage, and stress induced health issues further discourage officers from speaking out In some cases, whistles face the prospect of back being withdrawn in life threatening situations even.  [00:44:34] Speaker 3: It's like killing Susan. Everyone's guilty.  [00:44:36] Speaker 2: Okay. So what's the alternative? Just get rid of the police? Well, as they're currently constructed, yeah, a gradual dissolution of the current structure required. Public safety, as it is traditionally understood, narrowly focuses on preventing violent crime and property damage, primarily through police, a liberal approach. This framework ignores the broader and more complete idea of safety, includes access to safe housing, food, health care, and education. People living on the streets, scavenging for food, or suffering from untreated illnesses need direct help aimed at their core issues, not a gun in their face.  [00:46:05] Speaker 0: Eliminating the structures that perpetuate our serial logic, which is a huge problem in and of itself. Defending the police should be a goal of this process, but not the ultimate goal. Instead, resources must be redirected towards creating alternative systems that prioritize equity, empathy, and the provision of basic needs. A solid housing plan government mandated debt management and elimination, Mental health, support, and employment will go far further than anything else the US has tried. And will cost a fraction as much. A good start for your reading journey is when you Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander. Our Person's Ops Elite by Angela Davis, Who do you serve? Who do you protect?

You have to, like, tag things with the Or it depends if you need to.  [00:00:58] Speaker 1: set up what you wanted what you wanted to do, basically. You could create your  [00:01:03] User: own apps.  [00:01:04] Speaker 2: the fuck? Yeah.  [00:01:05] Speaker 1: I was like, it's shit doesn't work at first. Like, because it was I don't I still don't really get it, honestly. But yep. Let's see. Like, I said something about, about you having a Jeep Wrangler. Because there's an app for, like, helping you figure out, like, what, like, troubleshooting, like, your car. Mhmm. So  [00:01:20] Speaker 1: should try or whatever. I just said that, I said only thing I said was that my fiance has a 2004 Jeep Wrangler X. Then I said something about misfires. Or he's having issues with misfiring and a drop in gas mileage. And then so this is the what it says. Like, based on that conversation, what that I had with myself for, like, a second. So just, like, basic things, but, I mean, I just said the same thing that we've been just I just wanted  [00:01:45] Speaker 2: you  [00:01:46] Speaker 1: just, like, say whatever, like, we're talking to somebody about what's wrong with it. We'll listen and then Right. Tell you based on its car the car app, like, things  [00:02:00] Speaker 2: you  [00:02:01] Speaker 2: to see what it would do. The the problems that, like, I've had with it are all on that list. Because, like, I've had I've had problems with the fucking vacuum vacuum lines coming undone. They should trip me the fuck out. Like, that it only happened one technically, it's happened twice, but it only happened once when I was actually driving. But, there's, like, 3 vacuum lines on the side of the engine. And fucking, one of them came disconnected and, like, I had, like, 0 fucking power, like, fucking max speed of a total fuck a whopping 30 miles an hour. And fucking it sounded like there's, like, a fucking vortex up in my fucking hood. And I'm, like, what the fuck is that? So I pulled over This is leaving Justin's one night and fucking I pulled over at the ATB, and fucking, like, just popped the hood and and, like, left the engine running. It was just, like, fucking, like, hardcore. Like, what the fuck is it? Like, is this shit about the fucking blow up? And then, like, What the hell? I was I was like When did that happen?

But this is recently, or you didn't tell me about this. It  [00:03:08] Speaker 1: And that could be due to that was part of the was whatever was on the list just now,  [00:03:11] User: On  [00:03:12] Speaker 1: So weird.  [00:03:13] Speaker 2: Yeah. Because, like, the vacuum is developed from your intake stroke or whatever. So, like, your intake manifold has typically a couple of vacuum lines attached to it for, like, your brake booster. Because like your brakes aren't just like a a mechanical linkage or whatever. You are when you press the brake pedal, it actually it essentially gets magnified by the fucking brake booster Mhmm.

I can feel your desire for change, and I want to work toward that. Too. I also feel like you might be expressing how  [00:00:15] Speaker 0: 1, Who battles always choose I hear that, and I don't want that either. I want to find a way out of this cycle with you, sending me this song, also makes me think that Something that's been affecting how we interact I know you've faced your own challenges, and I wonder if this song is also saying, it's not just about us. I'm dealing with my own battles too.  [00:00:35] Speaker 1: happens between us. There's a lot more underneath the surface. I wanna be there for you as you work through that, just as I hope you'll be there for me as I do the same. What I'm hearing in this song is a mix of apology self awareness, and a sincere desire to change for both of us. I know you're overwhelmed, and this song feels like an expression of both the weight of our fight and your internal struggles. It's clear to me that you care deeply about us. But it's also clear that we've both been struggling. I feel the hurt from both of us in this, and I don't want it to keep repeating. To me, this song says, I see the cycle we're in. And I don't want this anymore. For either of us. I'm hurting. And I know my actions might be contributing to that pain. I wanna change. For myself, And for us, I'm ready to have that vulnerable conversation with you. I want us to both look at these patterns understand them, and figure out how to move forward together toward healthier ways of being with each other.  [00:01:25] Speaker 0: You sent me breaking the habit, I sat with it for a while because I wanted to really understand what it might mean and what you were trying to say. I hear you. And I feel the weight behind this. It feels like the song carries a lot of layers, Pain. Frustration, and a desire for change. I don't take that lightly, and I want  [00:01:45] Speaker 1: hard.  [00:01:46] User: And they speak to patterns that keep repeating.  [00:01:48] Speaker 2: Patterns that I think we both felt stuck in. When it says  [00:01:51] Speaker 0: One confused. And I hurt much more than any time before. Feel like they're coming from a place of deep pain. Maybe even loneliness. I know our fights have made it harder to connect, and I can only imagine how overwhelming that feels for you sometimes. If this is you asking for understanding, for patience, or even just for me to see what's going on inside you, want you to know that I'm listening. When the song says, I don't wanna be the one who battles always choose, I hear an urgency that I can't ignore. It feels like you're saying that something has to change because the way things are isn't sustainable. Maybe this fight or everything leading up to it feels like a turning point for you like you're ready to take steps to do things differently, Or maybe it's a way of telling me that we can't keep doing this without losing something important. I also hear that this might not just be about  [00:02:41] Speaker 2: breaking the habit. It's and I can only imagine one who battles always choose I hear an urgency, but I can't leave. Or maybe it's a way of telling me that we can't keep doing this without losing something important. I also hear that this might not just be about us.

You are  [00:05:24] Speaker 1: too.  [00:05:25] Speaker 2: And this song shows me that you know it. The phrase I'll never be alright, so I'm breaking the habit tonight. Strikes me deeply. It comes across as you saying, I know something has to change, and I'm willing to make that happen.

[00:06:41] Speaker 2: The urgency in the song, the sense that continuing as we have is no longer acceptable, suggests that we're at a crossroads. It could mean you're reaching out and hoping I'll see that we need to address these issues head on. Perhaps this is a moment where we decide if we can move forward together more honest and compassionately, or if things remain as they are, and risk falling apart. Finally, I realize that what you're dealing with might not just be about our relationship. Breaking the habit also speaks to personal struggles. Internal battles that influence how you react and respond to me.

Either on our own Or together, to change our dynamics for the better. I want you to know that I hear  [00:07:54] Speaker 1: you,  [00:07:55] Speaker 2: I see your effort in sharing this song.
