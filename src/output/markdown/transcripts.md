| SPEAKER_6 | I | 941.0593349999999 | 941.2193749999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | made this channel for people to post tips in. Of course, like, some people did. I posted the most. | 997.1999999999999 | 1002.97997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Goddamn it. | 957.519375 | 1014.4 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Bye. She's cute. I created the channel, but I didn't post in it yet. I just, like, made it so the other could post, I guess. Or it just took me a while to get all around to it. So 5 randomly immune it's kind of surprised me, but she posted, like, some generic tips Do not get greedy. I know many players that are too focused on the math. That they will die trying to go go for it. If anything, you should leave some of it to distract other So Normally, this will leave them in a vulnerable position where you can kill them or or it will give you a break from defending. From them. Be patient. If someone is hard to kill, just keep trying. If you are waiting for someone's head to peek out, just be patient and wait. I cannot tell you how much it helps both both with Robo kills and when I am scoring. Bieber persistent. Try not to give up. I have she's so cute. I have found that when you constantly chase someone, they normally will freak out at some point and kill themselves. I love I love to listen to music It will either soothe me and I feel more calm or or you can get me hooked up just buying whatever you would like to listen to. And English is her second language. | 971.389375 | 1094.91 |
| SPEAKER_3 | And | 1039.9593750000001 | 1040.1194750000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | she's, like, | 1096.1001 | 1096.8300000000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | here she was like, wait. How what year? 10 21? So she was like 16. | 1041.249375 | 1101.73 |
| SPEAKER_4 | 15 or | 1046.029375 | 1102.75 |
| SPEAKER_6 | 16. | 1102.8100000000002 | 1103.3100000000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Is No way. | 1048.3293750000003 | 1107.0200000000002 |

| SPEAKER_4 | been 14. I don't know. I hope she's not 18 | 1107.74 | 1109.98 |
| SPEAKER_5 | now. | 1109.98 | 1110.14 |
| SPEAKER_4 | That | 1110.14 | 1110.38 |
| SPEAKER_6 | would | 1110.38 | 1110.46 |
| SPEAKER_4 | be crazy. Oh my god. I'm already weirding myself out. My | 1110.46 | 1066.6793750000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | tips. | 1123.315 | 1123.815 |
| SPEAKER_4 | They're adding on to the wonderful tips already shared by Fi, and, well, that's a bit about it so far because everybody else, like, shared, like, stupid fucking knot tips. So disclaimer. These tips are meant to make you think they're why I said I wanted to freaking, like, weirded myself out. They're intended to be adapted to fit your play. They are also dependent on other factors. 1, one other thing to note, tips are helpful for fighting and scoring. I'm afraid they won't help you be a better runner or 4 circular. Then Tip 1, predictions. We are all familiar with advice such as it's all about what the other player is gonna do next or something along those lines, which is true. This is key, but When wouldn't that mean that being unpredictable is just as smart as being ants strategic, if not more. | 1075.6293750000002 | 1175.98 |
| SPEAKER_3 | That's why I'm | 1121.3593750000002 | 1178.3199000000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm excited. | 1178.38 | 1179.1999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | A large part of my play style is playing moves, I think, are the least expected moves I can make. ZIP number 2, always turn away, referring to times when you lay beside a player going straight. It's a it's tempting, I know, even as I stay here with this being my number 2 tip, ice I still tragically turn into kill someone who's coming up beside me or going head to head with me. Always keep your head angled slightly away or dead straight. And always and always turn away. Chances are they will give into temptation Alright. And if they don't, then okay. But at least you don't you didn't die. Tip | 1123.3993750000002 | 1156.5593750000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | number 3. If you're trying to | 1212.5400000000002 | 1214.4601 |
| SPEAKER_4 | score, the nectar ain't worth it. Wait. Wait. What? Oh, yeah. When you are in the middle of a mess oh, wait. What? If you are wait. What? I'm gonna hold on. If you try to score the next worth it. When you're in the middle of a mess of snakes, if you kill one that's mostly on land or probably mostly already being devoured by a pit of other players, just leave it. Don't lose your speed to eat 15 k on land and try to return to water | 1214.4601 | 1237.3595 |
| SPEAKER_6 | where | 1237.3595 | 1237.6100000000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | they are waiting for you. Same thing with with turnaround, when you have hunters after you. I don't even know what I meant there. Number 4, it's okay to be a runner sometimes. Applies to when you are scoring mostly. Little little snakes are just not worth it, especially when they just keep spawning. They are worth you dying on. So why would you risk killing them for a 100 KGS What I do is once there are no more crowns or there are way too many small guys in the area, I head to where there are some crowns. They will follow, kill each other, die along the way, and even get a little juicier So then so then they're an acceptable risk. So run a little and stop and fight they've gotten bigger or you've made it to where there are bigger snakes. Snakes. Tip number 5, let off the gas. Vary your speed. Sometimes it's necessary to gain control over maneuvering through sudden traffic jams and tight spaces. Also, other players can more easily calculate where you will be and and for how long your if your speed stays the same rate. So in data bearing, it makes it much harder to do that. Tip number 6. Chop down land. If you get pushed out of water, the sooner you decide trying to get into the water right right there isn't worth it, the better. The longer you stay there doing back and forth, the slower you become and and then you just end up all together and therefore can easily be surrounded. So a better while you still have some water speed to just let to just jet away jet away across land to where you can get in you can get into the water. Let's see. Salon Oh, I just got | 1181.7893750000003 | 1366.8500000000001 |

| SPEAKER_12 | propaganda? | 2997.5899999999997 | 2998.0899999999997 |
| SPEAKER_10 | Already says | 2998.15 | 2998.6299999999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | he's | 2998.6299999999997 | 2999.0899999999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Because he said agit prop. I know | 2943.749175 | 3001.81 |
| SPEAKER_10 | the agit | 3001.81 | 3002.21 |
| SPEAKER_3 | is for | 3002.21 | 3002.6099999999997 |
| SPEAKER_6 | for | 3002.6099999999997 | 3002.77 |
| SPEAKER_12 | agitation | 3002.77 | 3003.22 |
| SPEAKER_2 | and then prop is what? Propaganda. Propaganda is a very | 2947.3993749999995 | 3007.1099999999997 |
| SPEAKER_12 | acceptable Which is a trend for sure | 2951.6093749999995 | 3009.35 |
| SPEAKER_4 | that that like, | 3009.35 | 3010.25 |
| SPEAKER_12 | legitimate. Yeah. | 2954.669375 | 2958.039375 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Because Hassan and Ethan used to be really close, but no. No. No. At | 3014.02 | 2962.3693749999998 |
| SPEAKER_6 | all. Like | 3018.35 | 3018.83 |
| SPEAKER_12 | him. So we feel like | 3018.83 | 3020.1299999999997 |
| SPEAKER_7 | this is towards him. But racism is just very unacceptable. Antisemitism is an unacceptable form of bigotry whereas Islamophobia is a very acceptable form | 3020.27 | 3031.49 |
| SPEAKER_14 | of | 2975.5093749999996 | 2976.0093749999996 |
| SPEAKER_7 | bigotry. This ain't no Kain Olympics. Anti fatness | 3032.0501999999997 | 3035.0301 |
| SPEAKER_8 | is a far more acceptable bigotry than race And the existence of Hey. I don't know. I heard | 3035.17 | 3041.69 |
| SPEAKER_4 | enough to lose put a | 3041.69 | 3042.98 |
| SPEAKER_12 | a | 2987.3195749999995 | 2987.3461749999997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | but next don't know if his song | 3043.3799999999997 | 3044.74 |
| SPEAKER_12 | was being, like, | 3044.74 | 3045.62 |
| SPEAKER_4 | because but yeah. | 3045.62 | 3046.98 |
| SPEAKER_12 | Or ironic? Or | 3046.98 | 2992.7692749999997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | his son was just explaining what he would think. I don't know. | 3048.7499 | 3050.91 |
| SPEAKER_12 | On a brief basis? Because I'm pretty sure Hassan does not actually believe what he just said at all. Like, it has to be it. Has | 3050.99 | 3059.39 |
| SPEAKER_11 | to be quoting | 3059.39 | 3059.958 |
| SPEAKER_12 | him. To disagree with you guys Yeah. | 3059.958 | 3007.459375 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Is actually | 3009.5093749999996 | 3066.1299999999997 |
| SPEAKER_12 | But that is | 3066.21 | 3066.69 |
| SPEAKER_2 | how Ethan Used to be. | 3066.69 | 3068.23 |
| SPEAKER_12 | Talk. So Yeah. He's doing that. | 3068.8502 | 3070.24 |
| SPEAKER_7 | I didn't even | 3014.419375 | 3071.12 |
| SPEAKER_8 | realize | 3071.12 | 3071.6002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that. Of course, | 3071.6002 | 3072.0802 |
| SPEAKER_7 | the the damning part is the fact | 3072.0802 | 3073.68 |
| SPEAKER_6 | that | 3073.68 | 3073.8402 |
| SPEAKER_13 | he's | 3073.8402 | 3074.075 |
| SPEAKER_6 | actually | 3074.075 | 3074.31 |
| SPEAKER_8 | Jewish, and he's doing that. A lot of marginalized | 3018.4891749999997 | 3077.99 |
| SPEAKER_2 | oppression | 3022.769375 | 3023.269375 |
| SPEAKER_7 | is baked into the language because it's supposed to keep you captive. | 3023.5293749999996 | 3082.89 |
| SPEAKER_8 | Supposed to be carrying out the agency of white supremacy, and these oppressive systems without knowing it. His power | 3027.3993749999995 | 3090.5701999999997 |
| SPEAKER_7 | is powerful | 3090.5701999999997 | 3091.3102 |
| SPEAKER_8 | only when it's invisible. That's also the reason why you're seeing social sanctions being levied towards people who say the quiet part out loud. So when you have a | 3035.8693749999998 | 3099.41 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Kanye West, a varying, particular failed Austrian painter, in 4 k, and you see people backing up off | 3099.41 | 3106.75 |
| SPEAKER_11 | levying | 3054.9293749999997 | 3055.4293749999997 |
| SPEAKER_8 | punishments and pillaring, Asmongold Pillaring. For saying | 3056.0594749999996 | 3114.8402 |
| SPEAKER_6 | the | 3114.8402 | 3115 |
| SPEAKER_7 | quiet | 3115 | 3115.3201999999997 |
| SPEAKER_6 | part | 3115.3201999999997 | 3115.5602 |
| SPEAKER_8 | out | 3115.5602 | 3115.8001999999997 |
| SPEAKER_9 | loud, | 3115.8001999999997 | 3116.3001999999997 |
| SPEAKER_8 | and now he has walked that statement back. Why? That's the whole point. He always was like that. It was just a little bit quieter. | 3060.509275 | 3122.17 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Because, talk my words right now, you will see him cry cancel culture and then you will see him leave the left. If he ever was at it, just might. I | 3111.874006 | 3121.464006 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't remember that, but | 3121.464006 | 3122.3440060000003 |
| SPEAKER_0 | yeah. | 3122.904006 | 3123.234006 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I I agree about that guy. He's a weirdo. Sounds | 3123.234006 | 3129.2240060000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like a fucking | 3129.2240060000004 | 3130.294006 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Wait. What? Where is it? Oh, | 3132.524006 | 3136.084006 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Don't be so attached to who you are in the present that you don't give the future version of you a chance. | 3143.644006 | 3149.644006 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I applaud the fact that a small portion | 3151.9740060000004 | 3154.634006 |
| SPEAKER_4 | of our party is pretty much dipped | 3156.124006 | 3158.394006 |
| SPEAKER_2 | dictating where | 3159.1140060000002 | 3159.5140060000003 |
| SPEAKER_4 | we are. They are pretty | 3159.5140060000003 | 3161.814006 |
| SPEAKER_0 | much | 3161.814006 | 3162.0540020000003 |
| SPEAKER_4 | we are being branded as the most extreme of us. We need to take stock of why we are being held hostage | 3162.214006 | 3168.414006 |
| SPEAKER_1 | events, those big political events thinking that that would smudge over the reality of inflation. And how much groceries cost and how much gas cost and how hard it How | 3112.123384 | 3124.093381 |
| SPEAKER_2 | fucking do you think it's a lottery first | 3180.774006 | 3126.860051 |
| SPEAKER_3 | elect Trump, | 3182.894006 | 3183.5340060000003 |
| SPEAKER_0 | successfully harness | 3184.174006 | 3185.774006 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the anger and frustration felt by millions of Americans. Okay. The big come to Jesus moment. First, that was Hillary Clinton's top adviser. Philip Reins, finally saying yes to Democrats alienated voters. | 3130.9133810000003 | 3198.634006 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Obama by | 3198.854006 | 3199.714006 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Harris got the party to go too extreme, too far to the left. And that was just | 3144.213381 | 3204.2539960000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What? | 3204.4940060000004 | 3204.734006 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Saying, yes, Harris | 3204.974001 | 3205.754006 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Obama Biden Harris. There's What? She just went through all those names together as a very clean man right here. | 3150.3333810000004 | 3213.354006 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Now this pop show | 3213.354006 | 3214.0740060000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | report. What? So she tried to use the most, like, demonized names and contemporary politics aren't as far as, like, wait. What? That was so weird. Joining us | 3158.093381 | 3222.8040060000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | now, former president presidential candidate, political commentator, Larry Elder. Larry, sit tight for a second. Let's go through the quotes. We'll watch you react. | 3222.8040060000003 | 3229.5140060000003 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Biden Harris official said it's very clear we've got it | 3232.414006 | 3234.654006 |
| SPEAKER_1 | wrong | 3234.654006 | 3234.914006 |
| SPEAKER_3 | in economic policy. People feel squeezed. That higher than Biden leadership never bothered to actually listen to voters and understand what was appealing to them about Trump or why the Biden Harris economy was not working for them.

| SPEAKER_7 | And a half years ago? And unless you're not willing to tell, and the answer | 3346.123361 | 3404.584006 |
| SPEAKER_6 | is absolutely not. And for for whatever reason, Kamala Harris didn't seem to understand that. | 3404.584006 | 3410.384006 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. Democrats are in shock. Voters are in | 3354.723401 | 3412.7040260000003 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Kamala Harris | 3414.656636 | 3415.157706 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Apparently, he | 3415.408206 | 3415.909286 |
| SPEAKER_2 | thinks illegal aliens are | 3415.909286 | 3416.911406 |
| SPEAKER_4 | doing | 3416.911406 | 3417.1619060000003 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Crisis. You know, in the swing states, the housing is up, I think, like, 40% Since under Biden Harris. CNN's Van Jones says, quote, it turns out we, the media, were the idiots. The media in the far left are now in the minority, Larry. The majority of voters nationwide gave a rebuke nationwide to the left for left. | 3419.124006 | 3381.783401 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Make sure they all put this | 3437.7640260000003 | 3439.444006 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Harris, Sue, Biden, But, you know, voters said no to the smearing, no to using lawfare attacks. Instead, they want serious debate to fix America Minority and poor communities really gaining got hurt under this White House. | 3439.6840060000004 | 3452.564006 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Yeah. And when you have people like the Washington Post and the LA Times Yeah. To Kamala Harris, Something really is going on. It doesn't matter your race, doesn't matter your religion, it doesn't matter whether you're gay, whether you're straight, whether you're black, whether you're Asian, whether you're Hispanic, when you walk into that store and you're paying 20% more than you paid 4 years | 3397.7433610000003 | 3471.0540060000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | ago. Oh my lord. And they | 3415.4733810000002 | 3472.654006 |

| SPEAKER_7 | Donald Trump | 3418.533381 | 3474.994006 |

They don't they don't say, like, the the right. You know? They'll say, like, the I mean, some I'm not saying never, But not like hardly ever. Whenever they whenever you hear the right we're thinking neo Nazis and shit. Yeah.

Unless you're an elite alien, you're not better off, Mau. That's fucking | 3560.54529 | 3605.91529 |

| SPEAKER_1 | You | 3716.034665 | 3716.534665 |
| SPEAKER_4 | are now in the narrative age And in the narrative age, the truth is sacrificed. | 3772.89529 | 3778.60529 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. | 3729.884665 | 3729.964675 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That was an epoxy guy. This is this is not an epoxy guy. This | 3785.9453 | 3789.20529 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is the guy | 3789.20529 | 3789.76529 |
| SPEAKER_2 | with the god spinning | 3789.76529 | 3791.12529 |
| SPEAKER_3 | head. | 3791.12529 | 3791.28529 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Car cartoons. Fuse. If it's a good | 3735.304665 | 3793.9972900000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | idea to, then it will be deemed false. Calendly. Right. Why the only term some people require for their beliefs to be validated is fake news. That is why the term fact checker is now scoffed at because the truth no longer matters. Only the narrative matters. Allow me to provide you with a wealth of examples, including what really happened on January 6th, | 3793.9972900000002 | 3826.5152900000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Oh my god. There are fucking a lot of people who act like that was just a poor and insane. | 3771.054665 | 3832.0752899999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | What really happened | 3776.574645 | 3833.67526 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to the Like, they they were just touring the fucking capital. Like, what are you talking about? They built the windows. They're fucking like, I don't even know. I | 3833.67526 | 3841.54529 |
| SPEAKER_1 | was like, | 3841.68529 | 3841.77529 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like it's crazy. Economy | 3786.354665 | 3789.514645 |
| SPEAKER_4 | under Trump. It is crazy. Happened regarding corruption decision and free speech. Under Trump. I've chosen these things in particular because each of these have very specific narratives that people believe without feeling the need to research whether or not they're true. That's the purpose of the narrative. They've practically become sloganized. People have a Pavlovian response to these narratives. They do your thinking for | 3845.95529 | 3884.03529 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You | 3828.484645 | 3828.544665 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And if someone contradicts the narrative that has been etched into your mind, then the narrative protects itself. By labeling the contradiction as fake news. Let's start with January 6th. You know how else I know it's not in this | 3828.864685 | 3903.8252899999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | direction? | 3903.8252899999998 | 3904.08529 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Because this is | 3848.744685 | 3905.52529 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the | 3905.52529 | 3905.60529 |
| SPEAKER_2 | first These are little representatives in the I don't know. Senate or house the house, one of the 2. Sit it's literally sitting here saying that it was not anything bad. Like, it wasn't a big deal at all. It wasn't interaction. It wasn't anything, like, | 3905.60529 | 3920.92529 |
| SPEAKER_4 | like | 3866.464665 | 3866.704665 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like what? | 3922.68529 | 3923.50529 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Insurrection in the history | 3923.8052900000002 | 3925.29529 |
| SPEAKER_5 | where the people | 3870.694665 | 3927.28529 |
| SPEAKER_4 | that were a part of it were unarmed. The media. They felt like they couldn't trust anymore. This | 3871.944665 | 3933.48529 |
| SPEAKER_2 | is another big | 3933.48529 | 3934.36529 |
| SPEAKER_4 | thing. So they're in the capital. And you know what's | 3934.36529 | 3936.84529 |
| SPEAKER_5 | ironic? | 3936.84529 | 3937.34529 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I didn't 1 of them was armed. You you know, I come from Missouri where a lot of people are armed. | 3881.694665 | 3943.79529 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Not one of the people | 3888.214665 | 3945.42529 |
| SPEAKER_2 | at | 3889.924685 | 3890.024685 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Perris aren't blood. | 3946.00531 | 3946.90529 |
| SPEAKER_6 | I don't know how you're gonna take over the capital | 3891.0046350000002 | 3949.14527 |
| SPEAKER_7 | if | 3949.14527 | 3949.30527 |
| SPEAKER_6 | you're not armed. None of the people on the grounds of the capital had any firearms on them? That's a single one. | 3949.30527 | 3954.35529 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Really? | 3954.35529 | 3954.43527 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Now even though the Secret Service said 80% of the people that were at the Ellipse just an hour earlier listening to Trump's speech didn't go through the magnometers because they saw people in the crowd that had firearms they didn't want to go through that all marched to the Capitol building. What did they drop their gun off at a hotel? They give it to a friendly police officer? Did they find a fellow DC be, BLM guy? No. Single | 3954.43527 | 3972.94529 |
| SPEAKER_5 | gun. | 3973.40529 | 3973.90529 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Not a single gun was ever | 3974.20526 | 3976.25529 |
| SPEAKER_8 | recovered or on record at the January 6th inspection Ashley Babcock was killed. Nobody was killed. There were guns | 3920.834665 | 3983.94529 |
| SPEAKER_7 | down there. We Right. And there was a a | 3983.94529 | 3930.744665 |
| SPEAKER_2 | killer now. I'm so confused. | 3987.34529 | 3988.38529 |
| SPEAKER_4 | The narrative is no Republican legislators, and even Trump himself No. | 3988.38529 | 4002.25531 |
| SPEAKER_7 | No. No. No. | 4002.25531 | 4003.25529 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I may ask you something. | 3947.504665 | 4004.91529 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Oh, great. What does this look like to you? Currently, the trend code won the supreme court case. Against transgender people, didn't look at their Oh, it's good. | 3949.174665 | 4015.39527 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Fire | 4015.39527 | 4015.89527 |
| SPEAKER_7 | I | 3960.394665 | 3960.894665 |
| SPEAKER_2 | don't know. | 4017.01526 | 4017.69529 |
| SPEAKER_7 | I just chance | 4017.69529 | 4018.31529 |
| SPEAKER_3 | for | 4018.61529 | 4019.11529 |
| SPEAKER_7 | a bloodless service corn to health care Is it Trump support and then | 4019.17529 | 4022.53861 |
| SPEAKER_2 | they and this video. | 4022.53861 | 4023.97529 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Anyway, let's | 3968.234645 | 4024.82327 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I don't know. I'm not honest. I'm not sure which name it is. Because | 4025.12729 | 4027.73529 |
| SPEAKER_9 | of what you telling me | 4027.73529 | 4029.14527 |
| SPEAKER_3 | in the operation or what? No. I think | 4029.14527 | 4030.90529 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it was just, like, Whether or not, I think it's probably having something to do with, like, I'm guessing it probably had something to do with puberty blockers or something like that for kids. For kids or whatever before they start pee start puberty. Which they can always stop taking them and then have or start their puberty process. It's completely reversible or whatever. So it's just like so that they can decide I don't know. It's just like, it's better when they don't if they do this before they go through puberty puberty and then decide for sure that they wanna I don't know. It's not that big of a deal. They'll be black, like, it's like, abusing kids. I'm pretty sure the doctors know this, know how, like, when I don't know. The doctor is saying that this is the best choice for the kid. Then we should listen to the doctors. Right? Like, it's not even our business. The kids are, like, not being hurt at all. I mean, it sounds weird or bad. We just don't understand it, but | 4030.90529 | 4091.50529 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Yeah. | 4036.484705 | 4036.6047049999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's not it's it's completely it doesn't hurt anything, like Go | 4092.70532 | 4095.8252899999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | on. Those those are the hormone blockers that, like, that they're talking about fucking, those is that like a is the puberty blocker different than the hormone blocker? | 4095.8252899999998 | 4107.5652900000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm not sure about | 4052.624665 | 4109.40534 |

| SPEAKER_7 | me. | 4326.17523 | 4326.30529 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Video be damned. Witnesses be damned. Criminal Records. Be damned. It didn't happen. Because it goes against the narrative. And the narrative is no guns. So there were no guns, period. You see, logistically, police couldn't simply arrest all of those people at that time. So many of them were also naturally not many of the ones with guns. So a narrative took hold. That none of them had guns. But some of them indeed | 4271.364665 | 4307.534665 |
| SPEAKER_2 | were cops Gas court | 4363.57526 | 4364.47529 |

| SPEAKER_2 | I just turned it off because it wasn't being used at all. So, yeah, | 674.0662639999999 | 733.666889 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, | 678.426264 | 735.0668489999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I was just curious if didn't know for sure if there was something you're doing with it. | 735.0668489999999 | 740.306889 |

| SPEAKER_2 | What what how cold is it in this | 714.2462639999999 | 772.056889 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. | 722.596234 | 722.676264 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 45 degrees. Yeah. Or something. It it turns off at 45 degrees tilt. | 723.3162639999999 | 784.136889 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's weird. Yeah. Yeah. That's | 784.136889 | 789.4668889999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | how | 789.4668889999999 | 789.7068889999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it | 789.7068889999999 | 789.786889 |
| SPEAKER_2 | determines its tilt. So at 45 degrees tilt our it's depressed. Or whatever. Right? Is that I mean, that's what the bread is. Not really button. It's just pressed in whenever it's upright and then not whenever it's knocked | 789.786889 | 754.8563039999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | over. I was thinking that you had to be | 810.8369289999999 | 816.126889 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. It does have to be placed down on something, but, like, 45 degrees, I'm pretty sure that thing can't, like, like, if it was tilted a little bit, the thing wouldn't fall off. So I'm guessing it just means that at 45 degrees, gravity will make it fall off of whatever surface it's on. So that's why | 764.2362639999999 | 836.506889 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Gave a little bit of a commentary on it, which I'll just sum up briefly now. My experience with police officers just to be clear, I am not a blanket. The police don't have any problems. That's you gloss over it. I'm a fan. Who do you stipulate that there are some bail? I stipulate completely there are significant problems in policing in America. There's no doubt about that. The reason I believe, given my experience with police officers in New York City, I'm working in a heavily minority precinct, 90% black and Hispanic, the 75 precinct in East New York, Brooklyn, is now according to some friends I talked to and my experience in the beginning a little bit is a white police officer understands in a use of force interaction with a black subject that even if he follows the use of force guidelines to a t, his actions are gonna be scrutinized from a racial lens, not from a legal one. So he hesitates to use force in that situation try and back himself or herself out of it to avoid the legal tangled, legal entanglements later. I can't tell you how many friends of mine mine moved to cops still to this day, who are still in modern policy, who said if they waved you for help, wave back and keep going. Because you are gonna get if I kid I'm not making up. These are real things told to me. Wave and keep going unless it's a radio run. Because the minute you get involved, the cell phone camera comes out, and all of a sudden, you're the bad guy no matter what you do. That should tell you what's in their heads when they're out there dealing in a situation that might potentially involve | 0 | 145.920635 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But isn't that an argument for body cams? | 146.08063499999997 | 148.26063499999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It could be. I mean, I think body cam's a more complicated issue. We know, we don't have the time to wrap up here, but the first question you should ask yourself for body cam is, you know, do you have the right to make that footage go away? Everybody says, oh, you're policing the cops? I don't wanna be on your body cam. I mean, there are libertarian issues there from your perspective as well. It's not a simple issue. Mister | 93.48001000000002 | 112.64999 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Hey, guys. | 0 | 56.720625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You know some drivers are ditching their car insurance, and they're doing this instead. Now the reason I'd like to, just, ask mister Eldridge if he has any any comments to say the response to representative, Hank Johnson's question that, he had asked earlier? Earlier. I could do continue this conversation about that. I do. We've been talking about, disparate outcomes There was a young attorney named Barack Obama who joined with other attorneys to file a class action lawsuit against Citibank some years ago. And as a result of the class action lawsuit, the Citibank agreed to, to grant mortgages to a 186 people who had applied burned down, and the applicants argued that they were turned down because they were black. Well, they got the loans and virtually nobody was able to keep up with loans. Many of them went into default, indicated that the bank not terminating against C4D Black Pearl. Also, studies have found that community black banks often have a higher turn down rate for which borrowers than the majority banks because they are more thinly capitalized. Just because something has a disparate outcome does not mean that that outcome would result A race is was off the top a lot about the police officer. A few days ago, they started to say a man was in the backyard of his dog his, own house. That's a description of a suspect who was running on foot. Police officer chased is mostly homeowner for the suspect. Know about it is because the cop, we shot the suspect was white. The suspect was white. This took place Idaho. Therefore, nobody gave a written. But I assure you, if this had been a black suspect and a white cockroach know his name. The fact is there are more unarmed white people killed every year by the police than unarmed blacks. The media couldn't care less. CNN couldn't care less. Giving black people the false impression that the police were mowing down black people just because they are black. It is true that the police are 2 and a half times likely to kill a black suspect. It is also true that a young black man anywhere from 7 to 10 times more likely be a victim of a homicide, almost always be a victim at the hands of another suspect in the systemic racism against black people is a lie. And when it came to the election, the defenders of Biden were arguing, where is the widespread evidence of voter fraud? A fair question. Where is the wise forget the wise men. Where is the evidence of brutality against black people? If anything, the evidence shows police were more hesitant, more reluctant to pull the trigger on the black black suspect than a white suspect. It is a fraud. It has been caught and pushed the ball in the structure. We need to stop. Hey, dude. I took over to mister Walker. What is the message that you will give today, to a young young young who looks like to the and women's of, 2 races back, Jordan. The message I will give today is responsibility. Someone has to mute.

| SPEAKER_0 | Us in this moment. The French people sense that mankind is still under threat. They also sense that to continue living, they must rescue a certain idea of mankind from the crisis that grips the whole world. Out of loyalty to my country, I've chosen speak about this human crisis. Since I'm here to talk about What I know the best I can do is sketch as clearly as I can the moral experience of my generation. Because we have seen the entire world crisis unfold and our experience might shed a glimmer of light. Both on the fate of mankind and on some aspects of the sensibilities of the French people today. 1st, I'd like to define this generation for you. The human crisis, March 28, 1940 6. People of my age in France and in Europe were born either before or during the First Great War. Reached adolescence during the worldwide economic depression and turned 20 the year of Hitler's rise to power. To complete their education, next came the civil war in Spain, the Munich agreements, the start of another world war in 1939, the fall | 0 | 74.22 |
| SPEAKER_1 | struggle. I suppose this is what's now as an interesting generation and that it would be more useful to speak to you not in my own name, but in the name of a certain number of people. And whose intelligence and hearts were formed during the terrible years when, like their country, they were nourished on shame and lived by rebellion. Yes. Yes. This is an interesting generation faced with the absurd world its elders had concocted, they believed in nothing and yearned to rebel. Deliverance of its times and revolt against their citizens, against narrative, and against the very idea of a sentence. Painting was abstract. That is to say it was rebelling against figurativism, realism, and simple harmony. Music was rejecting was was rejecting melody, And as for philosophy, it taught us that there was no truth, only phenomena. That mister Smith monsieur Duvall, all exist as phenomena, but without these three particular phenomena, having anything in common. The moral attitude of our generation was even more categorical. Nationalism seemed an outmoded truth and religion an escape. 25 years of international politics had taught us to question our notion of purity. And to conclude that no one was ever wrong and that everyone might be right, As for our society's traditional morality, it seemed to us it hadn't stopped being what it had always been, a monstrous democracy. Thus, we lived in negation. 4,000 immune. Other generations and other countries have experienced this and other periods of history. But what is new here is that these same men strangers to any traditional values, had been forced to adapt their personal positions to a context of murder and terror. The situation led them to believe there might be a human crisis. As they had to live the most wrenching of contradictions. This was because they entered the war as one enters hell if it is true that hell is denial. They love neither war nor violence, yet they had to accept war and practice violence. They hated nothing except hatred yet they were forced to learn about difficult science. They had to deal with terror. Or rather terror with them. They found themselves confronted with a situation that rather than try to describe it general terms, I would like to illustrate the 4 short stories about a | -0.2806250000000037 | 214.44 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Oh my | 163.949365 | 220.99 |
| SPEAKER_1 | god. In an apartment building occupied by the Gestapo in the European capital, To accused men still bleeding find themselves tied up to a night of interrogation. The concierge of the building begins her careful household chores. In good spirits since she probably just finished breakfast. Reproach by one of the north's men. 2, Since his years have been badly torn during a previous session, he's wearing a bandage around his head. The German officer who interrogates him is the same man who had conducted the previous sessions. And yet he asks him 3. In Greece after an underground resistance operation, a German officer prepared to execute his brother's escape in his hostage. She chooses the oldest because he has a family. But her choice condemns the 2 others. Just as the German officer intended 4, A group of deported women, including one of our comrades, is repaired to the Supreme Court created to France by way of Switzerland. As soon as they enter Swiss territory, notice a funeral taking place. And the mere sight they say. Because they allow me to respond to something other than a conventional Yes. To the question, is there a human crisis? They allow me to reply just as the men I was speaking about replied. Yes. There is a human crisis because of today's world. We can contemplate the or the torture of a human being with a feeling of indifference. Friend and concern, scientific interest, or simple passive Yes. There is a human crisis. Since putting a person to death can be regarded as something other than the horror and scandal it ought to provoke, Since human suffering is accepted as a somewhat boring obligation, on a car with getting supplies or having for an ounce of butter It's too easy in this matter to simply accuse Hitler and say that since the peace is dead, its venom is gone. We know perfectly well that the venom is not gone. That he just each of us carries it in our own hearts. And we can sense this by the way that nations political parties, individuals continue to regard one another with the vestiges I have always believed that a nation is accountable for its traders as well as for its But likewise, civilizations, the white man civilization, I was responsible for their perversions for their successes. In this light, we are comfortable for the legacy of head Let us try then with help the 4 stories I have told to enumerate the most obvious symptom of the crisis. The first symptom is the rise of terror. A consequence of the perversion of values through which human beings and historical forces are judged not in terms of their dignity, but in terms of their success. The modern crisis because no one in the west can be sure about their immediate future. And they'll all live with a more or less defined view that they will be crushed. To say this miserable man, this modern day joke, perishing of his wounds We must first lift the burden of fear and anxiety so he can rediscover the freedom of to resolve any of the problems facing the modern conscience, This crisis is also based on the impossibility of invasion. | 221.05 | 481.46 |
| SPEAKER_0 | This one? | 433.609375 | 490.33 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The Greek mother I spoke about could not persuade the German officer that he had no right to force her into heartbreak. Yes, sir. And the German officer no longer represented men or mankind, but rather an instinct elevated to the status of an idea. Or a theory Even deadly passion would have been preferable. For passion runs its course, And another passion, another cry from the flesh or the heart. Might replace it. | 452.16937499999995 | 536.61 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Solitude. The people of France have system 12 100 calorie a day diet. But they have at least 6 different forms and a 100 official staff. It's the same it's the same way everywhere. We're where bureaucracy is expanding. To get from France to America, I used a lot of paper in both places. So much paper that I could probably print enough copies of this talk to have it distributed here without having to show up. So much paper, so many offices and functionaries, are creating a world in which human warmth has disappeared. Where no one can come into contact with anyone else except across a maze of what we call The German officer who spoke with care of the shredded ears of my comrade thought this was fine. Since Terrain was part of his official business, and there could not, therefore, be anything wrong with | 564.96874 | 621.7887400000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This, I suppose, is what is called good organization. The crisis is also about replacing real men with political men. Individual passions are no longer possible. Only collective that is to say abstract Whether we like it or not, we can't avoid politics. Of a doctrine. Human suffering is no longer considered a scandal. It is merely one bad variable in a reckoning whose terrible son has not yet been It is clear that these different symptoms can be summed up by something that might be described as the cold of efficiency and abstraction. This is why Europeans today know only solitude and silence. They can no longer And since they are no longer protected by mutual respect based on those values, alternative or executioners. This is what the men and women of my generation have understood This is the crisis they face. And are still facing. We attempted to solve it with the values at our disposal but which having no values at all other than an awareness of the absurdity of our lives. It was in this frame of mind that we were introduced to war and terror. With no consolation or certainty. We only knew we could do better with the groups taking charge in the 4 corners of in whose name they could oppose terror and nothing is important. There is neither good and soothe and wound the other. It is all the same. And since we thought of nothing, made sense, had to conclude will tell you that if Hitler had a chance to win the war, history would have paid him homage. Consecrated the hideous attacks with pedestal on which she And the belief of no doubt in history as we conceive of it today, would have consecrated Hitler and justified terror and murder just as we all consecrate and justify murder and terror, when we have the temerity But everything is meaningless. Awesome. In the absence of any higher values to believe in history had meaning nationalisms They thought and acted according to Ingalls attestable principle. And is made for history all swing in today's world is near to a Germanic philosophy of history reporting to which all of humanity is on the march. Nihilism has been replaced by absolute rationalism. Or if it is true that history of these that transcendent and inevitable logic, If it is true according to his German philosophy, that the feudal state must replace the state of anarchy, The nation states must replace feudalism. And that empires must then take the place of nation states and make the class they lead. And since these achievements can only be obtained by the usual means of wars, actions can be justified on the basis of good or evil. By how efficient they are. And so in today's world, Many of them succumb to one the other of these temptations. Which is how the world came to be ruined By the will to power and consequently terror, For if nothing is true or false, the the most efficient. Meaning the most responsiveness. Just and unjust. Putting to masters and slave. He who is right is he who enslaves. The housekeeper is right. SS men transformed the gravedigger. And the world at large, mistrust, resentment, greed, and the race for power. Are manufacturing a dark desperate universe in which each man is condemned to live within the limits of the present. And simple habits. And deep in their innate hearts a terrible revolt will rise up. It will sweep They are still haunted by 2 many monstrous images to imagine it will be easy to do. To allow to continue. Here's where their true problem begins. Terror, the replacement of real man by political and historical man. The reign of abstraction and fatality, and solitude without a future then these are the features we have to change if we wanna resolve the crisis. Our generation found itself faced this immense problem. And all that it negated We had to draw the strength to fight from these very negations. It was perfectly useless to tell us you must believe in God in Plato or in Marx. Because we did not have that kind of The only question was whether we were going to accept the world in which we A victim or an executioner. Of course, we wanted to be neither. Because we knew in the bottom of our hearts this distinction The murderers and the murderer suffer the same defeat. The problem was no longer whether to accept or reject this condition And this world we'd rather to know what reason we might have to oppose it. This is why we have looked for our reasons in the very revolt that let us And we understood that we were rebelling not only for ourselves, but for some shared by all men. In this desert of the heart in which we dwelled, one fact could revolt signify But at the same time, We said no to the world. To its essential absurdity, to the abstractions that threatened us, to the civilization of death that was being prepared for us. By saying no, we declared that things have lasted long enough and there was a line that could not be crossed. But at the same time, we affirmed | 567.6581150000001 | 1199.47874 |
| SPEAKER_0 | We're referring something But did this something at general value? Was it more than an opinion on conduct. The response is quite simple. The men I'm speaking about were ready to die in the course of their revolt. That would prove that they sacrificed themselves for a truth existence. And that exceeded their destinies. Where our rebels were defending against a hostile fate, was a value common to all people. When men were tortured in the presence of their housekeeper? When years were hacked with diligence, when mothers were forced to condemn their children, On the just, we're buried like eggs. These men were both judged as something in them was being | 1239.142898 | 1286.852898 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a common good to which all men could achieve self care? Yes. That was the great lesson of those disasters years that an insult aimed at a student in Prague affected a worker in the Paris. So Suburbs. Dead blood spilled somewhere on the banks of an Eastern European river. Could be the Texas farmer to spill his own on the ground of forest he'd only just got to know. And even this was absurd and crazy. Impossible, or nearly impossible to contemplate. But at the same time, there wasn't that absurdity The lesson that we found ourselves in a collective tragedy a sense of sheer dignity was at stake. A communion among men that had to be defended and sustained. With that in mind, we knew how to act, and we learned that people even in situations of absolute moral degradation, and find sufficient values to guide their conduct. Once people began to realize the truth way of communicating with each other, and mutual recognition of each other's dignity, It became clear that this very communication was what had to be served. To maintain this communication, I needed to be free. Since a master and a slave have nothing in common. And one cannot speak and communicate with a slave, Yes. Niche is a silence. The most terrible silence of all. To maintain this communication, we had to eliminate injustice. Because there is no contact between the oppressed and the profiteer. Need was also relegated to silence. To maintain this communication, had | 1231.532273 | 1330.902273 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to eliminate lines | 1386.882898 | 1387.652898 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and he tortures and constrains from the negative impetus that was the starting point of our revolt. We drew an ethos of liberty and sincerity. Yes. It was the act of communication that was needed to oppose the murderer's world. That's what we understood going forward. This communication must be maintained today if we are to protect ourselves from slavery, and terror. Because these 3 scourges are what mid silence rain in my neck. The only value that might save them from this desperate world. The extended brotherhood of men struggling against fate. At the end of this long night, we finally know that what we must do in the face of this crisis torn world What must we do? We kill millions of people, Each time we agree to think certain thoughts, You don't think badly because you're a murderer. Badly. | 1336.802283 | 1415.282273 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Murderers. | 1423.142283 | 1423.482273 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The first thing to do is simply to reject in thought and action any act We assumed or fatalistic way of thinking. The second thing to do is to unburn the world of the terror that reigns today and prevents clear thought. And since I've been talking to the United Nations so many important session, organization should solemnly proclaim in the wake of the Nuremberg trials, a worldwide abolition of capital punishment. A secondary one. We need not furnish the world with a political or moral gospel or catechism. The great mystery we to provide us with a catechism. With a complete philosophy and sometimes even we would also love it. Politics is to keep things in order and not to regulate our inner problem. As for me, I don't know if there exist any absolute or if there is one. I know it is not of a political order. The absolute not something we can decide on as a whole. It's for each of us to think about individually. Each of us should have the inner freedom to reflect on the meaning The absolute and our external relationships should allow us that freedom. Our life undoubtedly belongs to others. And it is right to sacrifice it if necessary. But our death belongs only to us. This is my definition of freedom. Before thing to be done is to seek out and to create on the very foundation of our negativity positive values that will reconcile negative with the potential for positive That is the word of philosophers, which I barely touched upon here. The 5th thing is to fully understand that this attitude means creating a universalism in which all people of goodwill can come together. To leave solitude behind, we must speak but we must always speak frankly on all occasions and never lie and always say everything we know Nobody in this world now or ever should have the right to decide that their own truth is good enough to oppose on others. Realize this ambition, The value of sustaining this shared consciousness must be rediscovered. The freedom we must finally win is the freedom not to lie. Only then can we discover our reasons for living and for dying. So here's where we stand. And I probably took a long way there. But after | 1424.4422829999999 | 1661.942898 |
| SPEAKER_2 | all, | 1662.002898 | 1662.492898 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the history of mankind is the history of its errors, not its truth. Truth is No. Of course not. And this is the reason we've been missing. | 1606.752253 | 1691.792898 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The | 1637.9722729999999 | 1638.212273 |
| SPEAKER_1 | world wants | 1694.192898 | 1694.812898 |
| SPEAKER_2 | but they | 1642.6922730000001 | 1698.992918 |
| SPEAKER_1 | do. Along with their passions, their dreams, and their communion. A few of us in Europe have combined a pessimistic view of the world with a profound optimism We can't pretend to escape from history for we are in history. We can only aspire to do battle in the arena of history to save from it. That part of man which does not belong to it. We want only to rediscover the past of a civilization where man would turning his back on history will no longer be enslaved by it. Or the obligation this person incurs with with regard to others. We'll be balanced It's this terrible condition that takes truckloads of blood and centuries of history to arrive at some imperceptible shift in human destiny. Such as the law For years during the 18th century, heads fell like hailstorms. The French revolution inflamed all in our enthusiasm and terror. We who live in France in the 20th century know this terrible law only too well. It took war, the occupation, massacres, a 1,000 prison walls, and a Europe racked by | 1698.992918 | 1802.442898 |
| SPEAKER_2 | grief | 1802.442898 | 1802.782898 |
| SPEAKER_1 | for a few of us to finally grasp 2 or 3 insights that might slightly diminish our despair. In a situation like ours, optimism seems scandalous. Because we did less than others. This is why we continue to live on contradiction. | 1746.882273 | 1777.622213 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The | 1779.092313 | 1779.252273 |
| SPEAKER_1 | only difference is that this generation can now join this contradiction to an immense hope for men for humankind. Since since I wanna tell you something about French there's a generation who thinks that anyone who | 1835.232898 | 1855.8628979999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Well, | 1802.362273 | 1802.862273 |

| SPEAKER_2 | rain. | 1972.772898 | 1973.272898 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. But well, I mean, but it may very well not. And so one way you | 1921.912273 | 1982.1528979999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't. | 1982.212898 | 1982.712898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Well, | 1933.982273 | 1934.292273 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you | 1934.292273 | 1934.792273 |
| SPEAKER_1 | left | 1992.032898 | 1992.532898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the room | 1994.4328580000001 | 1994.672898 |
| SPEAKER_0 | electronic in the rain or whatever it | 1994.672898 | 1997.000058 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is. And has made no effort thus far. | 1997.000058 | 2001.6528979999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I | 1953.382273 | 1953.462273 |
| SPEAKER_0 | mean, you could've taken the old as one. | 2009.442898 | 2011.3628979999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Again, it's just the same | 2011.3628979999999 | 2012.822898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | That's the only one that | 1956.842273 | 2013.9695379999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 2013.9695379999998 | 2014.156248 |
| SPEAKER_3 | knew existed until I | 2014.156248 | 2015.302858 |
| SPEAKER_0 | decided That one has been right there. That's the one you've used before that's been right there. I haven't only one has been there and then one has been elsewhere. So, like, that one has been there that whole time | 2015.302858 | 2025.262898 |
| SPEAKER_1 | though. Yeah. | 2025.262898 | 1971.822273 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I'm positive because that one was the one I found before I got the kit. | 2027.802898 | 2030.712898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 1977.0522729999998 | 1977.292273 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I know you just thought they were the same thing or same I mean, obviously, | 2033.272898 | 2037.932898 |
| SPEAKER_4 | actually, you did. | 2037.932898 | 2038.992898 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Yeah. | 1984.672273 | 1984.9922729999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Definitely. Yeah. But it's not | 2040.972898 | 2042.412898 |
| SPEAKER_4 | bad. It's okay. | 2042.412898 | 2043.552898 |
| SPEAKER_1 | To ourselves | 1990.392273 | 2046.952898 |
| SPEAKER_2 | This | 1992.212273 | 1992.452233 |
| SPEAKER_1 | was not easy. But, you know, if we did give ourselves this ride, it is because we know Yet we are not entitled to give lesson We have only right to escape the humiliating silence of those who are beaten and vanquished Beyond this, I ask you to believe that will know how to keep our place. Perhaps, as some have said, is indeed a chance that the history of the next 50 years will be made in part by nations other I have no personal opinion on this question. I know only that our nation, which lost 1,600,000 and 20,000 men a quarter century ago and which has just lost several 100,000 more volunteers, must recognize that it has exhausted or allowed others to exhaust That is a fact. And the opinion of the world, its consideration, or its disdain cannot change that fact. That is why it would seem to me ludicrous to solicit or try to affect it. | 2048.432858 | 2118.452898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But | 2063.832243 | 2064.072233 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it does not seem to underline how the present world crisis stems from these corals about precedence and power, I'd like to say just Whenever we judge France or any other country, or any matter in terms of power, we are aiding and abetting a conception of man that leads to negative mutilation. We are reinforcing the thirst for domination and we are headed toward the sanction. What goes for the world of action goes for ideas. And those who say or write at the end justifies the means Those who say and write that greatness is measured by force. They are absolutely responsible for the atrocious accumulation of crimes, disfiguring contemporary I think I've expressed everything I felt duty bound to tell you. My duty was to remain faithful to the voices and the experiences of our European comrades so they could not be tempted to judge them out of hand. For they sit in judgment over no one. No one that is except the murderer. I may regard all nations with a hope and certitude that these are capable of that each contain. Speaking in particular, I can say that the people I have spoken about have great respect for your | 2120.052858 | 2212.662898 |
| SPEAKER_2 | humanity. | 2212.662898 | 2213.162898 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And your choice for freedom and happiness. Which can be discerned on the faces of Yes. They expect from you what they expect of all men of goodwill And it is true that I'm a road to wisdom and truth. If there is | 2157.8222729999998 | 2243.952898 |
| SPEAKER_2 | one, | 2243.952898 | 2244.122898 |
| SPEAKER_1 | these men have not chosen the straight as to the simplest path. This is because | 2188.542323 | 2249.442928 |
| SPEAKER_4 | natural world war history | 2249.442928 | 2250.922898 |
| SPEAKER_1 | have offered them anything straightforward or simple. They are trying to forward with their own hands the secret they could not find in their given | 2194.942273 | 2259.242898 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Was indeed. My no. No. No. It's not. Yeah. No. He's not. Everything about him is, like, you know, | 2206.762273 | 2274.902798 |
| SPEAKER_2 | They | 2219.582273 | 2219.902173 |
| SPEAKER_1 | try to save from mankind where it can still be | 2275.882798 | 2278.302898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | safe. | 2278.362798 | 2278.472898 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And that is their only ambition. If such an effort can find some expression in France, And if this evening I have been able to give you even a faint idea of the passion for justice inspires all French people It will be our sole consolation. And my humble source of pride. | 2223.532273 | 2299.5828979999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Thank you. I take it he scorns. | 2247.572373 | 2313.822898 |
| SPEAKER_4 | No. Well, the person he was reading was he was reading it was like an anniversary of Albert Camus. | 2259.442273 | 2321.3328979999997 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Thomas? | 2266.4722730000003 | 2266.872273 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Kamu's, some of the speech that he gave. And, like, is the guy I was talking about, or this is, like, the thinking I was trying to, like, talk about the other day. Or not the other day, but a while ago whenever, That's it. Whenever we were listening to that zip sky, and he was talking about the, I can't say it. And he was talking about the the Jew person Jewish person who was talking about, his way of just, like, was all, like, all that mindset kind of thing and, like, gave no, like, regard to like, the outside world at all. It's all up to you basically in your frame of mind. Remember I was, like, really disappointed in it? Yeah. Yeah. So this was the other person who was also part of or Like, there whenever the Holocaust was going on. And his take on things was, like, way different and not super, like it wasn't, like, super it wasn't nihilistic or anything like that. But it also wasn't like, you know, there's no bad. You just set your mind to the right thing, and then you'll good. | 2267.432373 | 2336.9322730000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | You'll | 2392.912898 | 2393.072898 |
| SPEAKER_4 | get through it kinda I don't know. That was just, like, bizarre to me that this guy was, like, sitting here And, because he was rich and famous and the fact he was still, subjected to the same thing that all of the other normal people, normal Jews were subjected to is like, that was bizarre. I don't know. That just seems really weird to me anyways. Like, what kind of argument is | 2393.072898 | 2411.072898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like a example of Pretentious | 2411.072898 | 2358.3123729999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Well, | 2359.212273 | 2359.712273 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I don't know. Somebody who thinks they're too good for, like, that They're so they're so convinced of their status that, like, they think that they're too good for shit. | 2364.192373 | 2428.682898 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Well, like, it was it's like a well, maybe. I I just meant, like, that's what's that that that's what that channel, that guy was saying. That's what he said about him was that like you know, here's a here's a a famous guy or whatever, some with status and stuff like that by who, like, you know, he was somebody important, and he still was subjected to this kind of, like, torturous, like, thing. So to me, that that point is this kinda like, well, what? Why would he not be? He's Jewish. That is why they're getting this sort of treatment anyway. It's not because they're not smart or not, like, of any importance. It's because they're Jewish. Like what do you mean? So I don't know. It just like was a weird thing to even point out. But then that guy the guy of status or important that was still subjected to, like, having to go to these concentration camps or whatever, And Like, no. He made it out alive. Like, he his whole thing was after he dealt with all that or went through all that, he just said, oh, just have the right mindset and you'll make it out alive. Kind of thing. I was like, wait, | 2373.0221730000003 | 2491.382898 |
| SPEAKER_2 | what | 2491.382898 | 2491.592898 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Like, I mean, I'm not saying it's like a bad way to see things, but like in such situations, you have to like not I mean, what? I | 2435.6122729999997 | 2498.812898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | don't | 2498.812898 | 2498.972898 |
| SPEAKER_4 | know. It's just | 2498.972898 | 2499.772798 |
| SPEAKER_5 | like weird. It's a good card. And it | 2499.772798 | 2501.052898 |
| SPEAKER_4 | may have been | 2501.052898 | 2501.6928980000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the reality of your fucking | 2448.0122730000003 | 2505.6128980000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Yeah. | 2450.272273 | 2450.5923730000004 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And it may not have been that he was trying to say, like, oh, you'll make it out of Auschwitz if you fucking have the right mindset, but more like, you know, I went through all of this and I didn't have the right mindset, and now I'm still able to like know? Achieve great or whatever. I don't think it was I hope it wasn't that mindset get you out of Auschwitz. Right? Is that the fucking name of the concentration camp? Yeah. Concentration camp. I mean, I don't think that was mindset. But he def it definitely was, for some reason, a part of the whole, like, narrative was just like this guy did like was subjected to all this crazy stuff | 2506.572998 | 2539.842898 |
| SPEAKER_0 | and now | 2539.9028980000003 | 2540.352898 |
| SPEAKER_4 | he has and he says, and he still says, like, you know, just it's all about mindset, you know. Just have the right mindset. You'll get through. Don't so negative or some I don't know. Don't even | 2484.6122729999997 | 2550.182898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | know. | 2550.182898 | 2550.432898 |
| SPEAKER_4 | But this was like and this guy He's also got pretty much the same background he's of. Status or importance. I don't know necessarily that he was like, if he that he was part of or went And, like, I had to be don't know, experienced at, fucking concentration camps, but his take on it regardless of whether or not he was involved I don't think it matters, like, if he was actually there or not. I feel like he had every right to say whatever he wanted to say because he was saying, like, His whole thing was that know? Like, his first of all, his thing that he's known for is absurdism. That's his, like, theory or whatever that he is, known for. So | 2494.9322730000004 | 2538.4322730000004 |
| SPEAKER_5 | but And | 2539.0722729999998 | 2595.6928980000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | absurdism. Absurdism is, like, just the fact that things are fucking it's like the world is absurd, you know, like things that can't be explained. | 2595.6928980000002 | 2604.072898 |

| SPEAKER_5 | totally different. | 2661.7622730000003 | 2718.802998 |

| SPEAKER_4 | down | 2865.122898 | 2865.622898 |
| SPEAKER_8 | I don't even know why the fuck I wanted to listen to it so bad. Like, why I wanted to understand what you're saying. But maybe it's because my the whole, like, whenever heard about her, like, came across Albert Camus absurd absurd | 2809.8622729999997 | 2878.202898 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Absurd? | 2878.5127979999997 | 2879.0127979999997 |
| SPEAKER_8 | Absurdism. It, like, was really interesting to me, and then the title of this speech was the human crisis. So I don't know. I just I thought it would be really interesting, and mean, some parts were really interesting, yeah. It took me forever to, like, okay, I'm just gonna sit down if I can put on captions and actually read it. And just pay attention to it. And | 2823.6122729999997 | 2901.8628980000003 |
| SPEAKER_4 | more interesting. | 2846.732273 | 2903.2928979999997 |
| SPEAKER_8 | But, yeah, it took me a lot, like, a shit ton of times. Like, right now, I still didn't even really listen to it because it's very boring. | 2849.0522730000002 | 2911.5127979999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Cam, | 2858.152273 | 2858.3123729999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Camuto also gave the speech I'm told that Brooklyn College | 2914.452898 | 2917.982898 |

| SPEAKER_5 | he is famous. | 2930.412998 | 2931.232898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | He funded he started founded fucking, Percival Books that their their mission or whatever is to fucking get, unknown authors published or whatever. | 2877.0122730000003 | 2947.132898 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Oh, that's | 2891.272273 | 2947.812998 |
| SPEAKER_7 | cool. | 2947.812998 | 2948.272898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. That's that's But pretty cool. I | 2892.932373 | 2950.672998 |
| SPEAKER_8 | can see the publisher. | 2950.672998 | 2951.732898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. He's he's the he's the founder of the | 2896.422173 | 2954.6128980000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | the organization. Press, I believe this was Yeah. But are | 2899.212273 | 2957.7528979999997 |
| SPEAKER_8 | they pub or is he a publisher? Is that is that press whatever he founded, is it a publisher? | 2957.7528979999997 | 2963.382798 |
| SPEAKER_5 | K. | 2907.5722729999998 | 2908.0722729999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah, their their mission is to Good. Unknown authors. | 2908.6422730000004 | 2968.9028980000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | So does | 2969.602898 | 2970.0028979999997 |
| SPEAKER_8 | publishing unknown authors. Right? I mean, there's 2 different things there. He could either work to them published by publishers, or he could be a publisher so he publishes them. That's what I'm asking. Like, | 2970.0028979999997 | 2980.312998 |
| SPEAKER_9 | I'm just asking | 2980.312998 | 2980.552998 |
| SPEAKER_5 | which one. | 2980.552998 | 2980.952898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I didn't read that part. | 2980.952898 | 2981.492898 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Yeah. | 2981.492898 | 2981.7128979999998 |
| SPEAKER_8 | That's all I had asking. Wait. | 2926.052173 | 2983.152798 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Wait. No. Because I | 2983.152798 | 2983.992898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | have I thought, like, that he founded the fucking the deal or whatever meant that, like, I guess they find and publish. But I don't know if that's an answer to your question. | 2983.992898 | 2992.632898 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Well, | 2936.8922730000004 | 2937.3922730000004 |
| SPEAKER_8 | My question was just, like, do you know if it's that he is a publisher? Meaning, he could actually be the one that publishes these unknown authors? Or does he literally find authors publishers to publish them, like, through connections or something like that with Publishers. | 2938.332373 | 2954.8222729999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I think he is the publisher. | 2955.142173 | 3012.742798 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. | 3012.9628979999998 | 3013.4628979999998 |
| SPEAKER_5 | But he | 2957.672273 | 3014.532898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | he doesn't publish them on, like, under his name or | 2959.192373 | 2961.872273 |
| SPEAKER_4 | whatever. He's not under that's not the same thing. A publisher is, like, a penguin penguin | 3017.852898 | 3022.162898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Bush. | 3022.242898 | 3022.322898 |
| SPEAKER_9 | Fucking | 3022.4028980000003 | 3022.642898 |
| SPEAKER_8 | yeah. That's the publisher. I'm not I know I know how this works. | 3022.802898 | 3025.8628980000003 |
| SPEAKER_9 | I'm | 2970.682373 | 2970.842273 |
| SPEAKER_5 | not sure, like, | 3026.822898 | 3027.802898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I believe he is the publisher | 2972.602273 | 3030.042998 |
| SPEAKER_9 | then. | 3030.102898 | 3030.552898 |
| SPEAKER_8 | It wasn't a surquestion or anything. I promise. | 2974.732273 | 3032.892798 |
| SPEAKER_3 | The publisher, I guess. | 2977.2622730000003 | 3034.602898 |
| SPEAKER_8 | Okay. That makes sense. Mean, it wasn't it wasn't a trick question either. I was, like, actually wondering what | 3034.602898 | 3040.102898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. I was just trying to make sure that I actually answered the question and, like, didn't just not answer the question, but think I answered | 2984.122273 | 3047.2627979999997 |
| SPEAKER_5 | it. | 3047.2627979999997 | 3047.7627979999997 |
| SPEAKER_8 | Would have told her, I guess, | 2992.3622729999997 | 3049.662898 |
| SPEAKER_9 | maybe. | 3049.662898 | 3049.8628980000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Typically do. | 2994.202273 | 3051.009498 |
| SPEAKER_8 | I mean, you figured it out you figured or I figured out that you've just that that you weren't sure what I was asking. So I'm | 3051.009498 | 3003.382273 |
| SPEAKER_3 | sorry, babe. | 3059.3628980000003 | 3060.5428979999997 |
| SPEAKER_9 | Mhmm. | 3004.977273 | 3005.3922730000004 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Oh, god. | 3010.782273 | 3067.882898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. I'm probably gonna go to go to Not probably. If you if you don't object, I'm been going real quick. | 3013.2222730000003 | 3079.0028979999997 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I | 3023.082273 | 3023.4272730000002 |
| SPEAKER_9 | mean, | 3079.407898 | 3079.7528979999997 |
| SPEAKER_8 | why would I object? I mean, are you are you gonna hang out there for, like, hours? Is that what the means or | 3023.932373 | 3083.912898 |
| SPEAKER_5 | what? | 3028.092273 | 3028.332273 |
| SPEAKER_8 | Okay. I mean, I mean, I'm not gonna object object either way. More | 3084.312898 | 3087.372798 |
| SPEAKER_9 | important This | 3087.752798 | 3038.2222730000003 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Gender war. Don't know. It's just very interesting. Like, I don't know. I don't not really sure, like, what it accomplishes except for just literally points out reality. But I mean, in a stark way, but maybe I just see it more so. I don't know. It's very interesting. The more people | 3106.3990559999997 | 3127.549056 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that see reality, and have it summed up in a song, Like, the more people actually think about chain in their reality. | 3127.549056 | 3136.8090549999997 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. And she definitely points out some stuff, but, like, | 3137.109056 | 3139.109056 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I | 3139.109056 | 3139.1890559999997 |
| SPEAKER_0 | but see if people could see this and be like, oh, yeah. She's right. But, like, but there's no end There's no, like, conclusion or no, like, point in, like, it's like so you just pointed out all the differences, but you didn't ever you didn't push back on any them. You didn't really push back and say I mean, in a way she did because it's just the absurdity of it, like, and the contradictions within it all. So like it. Why why it's like that? And without that answer, it won't ever change. Or without, like, that kind of questioning into looking at why. What's the fruit? What? What? That one's definitely older. But yeah, that makes sense. | 3139.7490589999998 | 3178.69906 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's crazy. Mhmm. | 3123.408431 | 3180.909056 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Uh-huh. | 3125.3134309999996 | 3125.698431 |

| SPEAKER_2 | ginger wall has gone way too far. It needs to stop. What the fuck shall I? I mean, I don't I don't know. I would be I can't really figure out what her intention is behind the video, because she also has another video called woke woke black folk. Like, what? Don't even want I don't even know. She's back. | 3129.9884309999998 | 3206.489056 |

| SPEAKER_1 | I | 3162.2184349999998 | 3162.3784309999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | feel like maybe she was, but that this gender war video was very anti like, I feel it's not very griffed like, you know, like, we would never see | 3218.359056 | 3227.6523909999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like ultimate drift when he told you obviously drift? | 3227.70572 | 3230.1290559999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Babe. This is 8 years ago, and this is 2 2 weeks ago. Like, I saw the new one that the gender war one. So maybe she's she's the fact | 3174.388426 | 3238.099056 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the other one was from 8 years maybe she's changed her mind a little bit. A grifter | 3238.099056 | 3242.179056 |
| SPEAKER_1 | or changed from a grifter? | 3242.179056 | 3243.219056 |

| SPEAKER_0 | they stopped being well, sometimes they're not grip birds, really. They just, like, they're just ingrained with the same ideas, but, like, when you're | 3195.8684209999997 | 3259.719056 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like when you're black and you literally can | 3205.398421 | 3263.389056 |

| SPEAKER_2 | That's what I that that's what I said. At first I mean, there wasn't anything wrong with that at | 297.276944 | 301.25694899999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | all. I was | 301.25694899999996 | 302.056944 |
| SPEAKER_2 | just acknowledging | 302.056944 | 302.876944 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that | 302.93695 | 303.096944 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you | 303.096944 | 303.25694899999996 |
| SPEAKER_0 | were, like, | 303.25694899999996 | 304.19694400000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | being mindful, and | 248.776319 | 305.63694399999997 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I was appreciating it. That's | 305.63694399999997 | 306.996944 |
| SPEAKER_2 | all. | 306.996944 | 307.456944 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. I wasn't saying there was anything wrong with it. I was saying, like, I know that's why you're saying that and, like, so thank you. | 251.956325 | 314.01694399999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I | 259.476319 | 259.63631899999996 |
| SPEAKER_0 | mean, it's not, like, gone unnoticed | 315.616944 | 317.456944 |
| SPEAKER_1 | or anything. Usually, this But that's very much the same. The notions that don't fit our background is assumptions are seen as too far out and lacking in in credibility. Mhmm. Way to do this Very small lectern we've got here. No. I just like a good sound system, if I can. Okay. Today, an analogous concept might | 317.456944 | 294.91630899999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | be the dominant paradigm. A paradigm | 350.896934 | 353.396934 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is a philosophical or theoretical framework which within which empirical hypotheses are drawn and scientific theories develop. That's the way we usually that's what we usually mean by paradigm. It's it's developmental. More popular use It means the, today I think it means the dominant paradigm is the mainstream ideology. You see bumper stickers that say subvert the dominant paradigm. And then the paradigm is based on the unanimity of of bias, and that unanimity of bias is what passes for objectivity in mainstream disc | 353.616934 | 398.14694399999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | On the Super Bowl | 343.316319 | 400.176944 |
| SPEAKER_1 | objectivity | 400.576944 | 401.076944 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Was | 401.616944 | 402.116944 |
| SPEAKER_1 | as another. If objectivity is really little more than a conformity of bias, then the paradigm about as reliable or unreliable as another. It is awful. | 354.576319 | 424.716944 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yes. An opinion. It's your opinion. So these are not opinions, man. | 399.076319 | 492.486944 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Where we're left at you can say that the dissenting opinion the radical view, are generally not always, but generally, are more reliable than the dominant Because they're more regularly challenged and tested against They don't get a free float down the mainstream. They're not supported by the unanimity of bias that passes for objective Regarding orthodoxy, Most insidious oppressions are those that so insinuate themselves into the fabric of our lives and into the recesses of our minds that we don't even realize they're acting upon us. | 438.976319 | 552.266944 |
| SPEAKER_3 | In | 497.45629899999994 | 497.696319 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the face of this, the author the head heterodox view, the descending view is not just another opinion among many. It has a special task to contest the prevailing orthodoxy to broaden the boundaries of Debate. To wake people up to unearth suppressed data, The function of orthodox opinion is just the opposite. To keep the parameters of discourse as narrow as possible, Just listen to a presidential press conference, for instance. 2 dismiss evidence that ill fits the dominant paradigm. So all opinions are not of the same value. It depends on what they're being used for. What interests they serve, We've all observed that if something doesn't fit what people believe, now you've know what that, you know, about this If something doesn't fit what people believe, they marshal up their reserve defenses and arguments And sometimes very bitterly and very unyieldingly unreceptively It's called visiting relatives. | 553.676944 | 636.186944 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Right? | 636.806944 | 637.306944 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. How many have had this experience? | 584.6163389999999 | 642.456944 |

| SPEAKER_2 | shit. | -15.680624000000002 | -15.200624000000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. Well, I feel she she's so weird with, like, when she decides to poop inside. It's like just outside, you didn't go poop, you come inside and poop. Then other times it is like, you should have had a poop a long time ago, like a big fat poop, and you didn't poop anxiety at all. You're just like it's just weird. I I don't understand why | 40.780001 | 56.359995999999995 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm. | 56.359995999999995 | 56.859995999999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, now would have been an okay and understandable reason for her pooping inside kind of thing. Because she had all that food and, you know, and just yeah. And she hasn't been outside in a while. But then other times, it's like you didn't eat anything. You've been out you were just outside and come inside and poop. And | 4.189375999999996 | 20.17937599999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you wait until, like, you're, like, barely within eyesight and | 76.160001 | 25.029376 |
| SPEAKER_1 | shit. Like, look at It just poops in a bed, and then she can't lay in a bed anymore. | 81.819996 | 86.430001 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Over there? I don't I mean, yes. It is definitely something up, but I don't know about how It's how it worked for as far as being easier to clean up, but probably Yeah. Just put that just shake that off outside something | 48.049375999999995 | 63.12937600000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | probably. | 64.079376 | 64.579376 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You don't have to do it right now, though. Just put it don't know. | 65.699386 | 125.27000100000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. | 102.859386 | 103.24937599999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | For sure. For | 104.049376 | 106.17937599999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | sure. | 162.160001 | 162.660001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Definitely. She's definitely deaf. But sometimes she does hear me. Like, I don't know. She's weird. I think it has to do with, like, my pit the voice My the picture of my voice or whatever too. Because, | 107.99937599999998 | 119.819366 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, I know she hears me sometimes, like, when I say, like, really, like, low, | 175.799991 | 181.130001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | They go home. Oh, | 126.519376 | 127.99937599999998 |

| SPEAKER_2 | now, | 184.540011 | 185.040011 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I know | 129.74937599999998 | 186.050001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You don't think it's your body | 186.130001 | 187.250001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | language? No. I | 187.250001 | 188.600001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm pretty sure she she, like, feels | 132.77937599999998 | 190.700001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | she | 135.549376 | 136.049376 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, just associations with you saying those things maybe is what she's more going off of. Maybe it is, but maybe she | 138.799376 | 201.710001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | does. Do you feel | 201.710001 | 202.590001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | sound as well? Sometimes. | 202.590001 | 149.119376 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Especially when you can't hear it, you can only I would imagine it might be easier to sense that, but also only if you can feel the vibrations from it. | 149.27937599999998 | 213.000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. | 157.419376 | 157.919376 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. | 160.77937599999998 | 161.179376 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The vibrations are heavy enough | 217.160001 | 219.370001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | when I say, like, go home. That's | 164.429366 | 221.930001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | what I'm | 221.930001 | 222.340001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | saying. Yeah. Is | 222.340001 | 223.140001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it it's not necessarily that she can hear you, but the all of the associations with it, she reckons recognizes, and so that's how she knows what you're saying. Possibly. Possibly. I don't know for sure. Your body language and the fact that she could feel it just like because she could feel it whenever you're whenever you sternly to her. | 223.140001 | 240.77000099999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 184.949376 | 185.40937599999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Maybe. | 185.569376 | 186.069376 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But, yeah, I I don't know. I have no idea how that works. And if, like, deaf means you can't hear certain pitches, or if deaf would mean you can't hear certain, like, volumes. I guess. Does that make sense? Nope. I'll just keep wondering about it until it makes sense. | 194.71937599999998 | 275.990001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. | 265.599396 | 265.759396 |

| SPEAKER_2 | okay. So, like, | 325.520001 | 326.580001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. I mean, that's the only thing I can think of that it might have been. So that's the only thing | 274.159376 | 335.410001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I can think of that it might have been or actually was. I | 335.410001 | 338.210021 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't know. Yeah. That was neat. | 338.210021 | 342.320001 |

| SPEAKER_0 | I mean, I couldn't really understand what he was saying. That's necessarily either, though. So | 262.22937500000006 | 321.57 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Oh, you say | 322.04997000000003 | 322.62 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, I couldn't hear the words, like, exactly. | 266.63937500000003 | 324.89000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Course? | 325.14000000000004 | 325.61 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Some most of it. I heard that better than the other stuff, but, so I about, like, the yeah. You can read it though. | 269.789375 | 333.45 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Okay. Like, the first verse is, dancing on the crumbling precipice The rocks are coming loose just at the edge. Are we laughing? Are we crying? Are we drowning? Are we dead? Or is it all again? The balls are getting closer every day. That could never happen here. We used to say has this war come to our doorstep? Has this moment finally come? Or is it all again? Are we not good? And, are we not bread? Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker? We not good? Are we not we not brave enough? To become something greater than the violence in our | 277.63937500000003 | 373.16 |
| SPEAKER_3 | nature | 373.16 | 373.66 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Are we not good? | 318.03935500000006 | 375.23998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. But still, actually, I still don't really get that. That part doesn't really make sense. The the is it all a dream on that on that First on the course, I guess, doesn't really make sense to me because are we not good enough, or is it all a dream? Like, why would it be it's not a dream. Like, that's not what we believe. We don't believe that we're good enough and, like, | 323.109355 | 398.69502 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Am I, like, misinterpreting what that means? | 342.88937500000003 | 401.69 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Right. He's he's saying, like, are we not are we not collectively, are we not good enough to become something greater | 345.70937499999997 | 409.20998000000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | than Oh, no. Our maker? I was | 353.529375 | 412.62 |
| SPEAKER_0 | thinking, like, Good. | 412.62 | 358.11937500000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, everything that we're seeing or believe or whatever that It's not real | 359.25937500000003 | 421.13 |
| SPEAKER_0 | kind of thing. So I was | 421.19 | 422.47 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, by | 422.47 | 422.81 |
| SPEAKER_3 | but | 367.469405 | 367.54939500000006 |
| SPEAKER_0 | so yeah. I I just thought that what he was saying was | 423.61 | 425.59000000000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that that's the way | 369.769395 | 426.31 |
| SPEAKER_3 | it is, and | 426.31 | 427.03002000000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | he's basically making people question or wanting people question, and he is questioning whether or not it's real at all. Like, I was like, but that's not what people do. | 427.03002000000004 | 435.46000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's | 435.46000000000004 | 435.54003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | not it's | 435.54003 | 436.50002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | not the existing that he's questioning. It's it's reality He's questioning our interpretation or the like, believing in a hierarchy is that hierarchy even fucking real? Yeah. | 436.50002 | 395.149375 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But exact | 451.13 | 451.61 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you're | 452.01 | 452.17 |
| SPEAKER_1 | right. But that's that would be that would be along the line the way he was saying. But I would think he would be saying in question isn't it is it all a dream? But he didn't he I thought he was in, like, listing things that would be a we are good we are good enough, like, I think I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Brave | 452.17 | 414.409375 |
| SPEAKER_2 | enough? To Yeah. You tell something greater. Yeah. | 470.85 | 474.83000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I get it. | 474.83000000000004 | 475.56 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Image of | 419.819375 | 476.41335000000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | our maker. Yeah. So that all sounds good and not like | 476.41335000000004 | 478.44002 |
| SPEAKER_0 | the same thing as, like, | 478.44002 | 479.58000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And also, like, are we not good enough to | 424.17939500000006 | 482.56 |
| SPEAKER_3 | fucking | 482.56 | 482.75 |
| SPEAKER_2 | not blame on nature for the violence? | 428.129345 | 486.45998000000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. Exactly. | 430.88937500000003 | 488.21000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 433.36937500000005 | 433.449375 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But Like, | 489.43 | 434.39939499999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | basically | 490.38002 | 490.86 |
| SPEAKER_3 | be | 490.86 | 490.94002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | accountable. So | 490.94002 | 491.50002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | when he says, or is it all dream in the chorus, he's talking about it's just in his own it's his own dream. Kinda thing. But the the other verse is We're, like, those are societal, like, things that, like right? Okay. I get it. | 491.50002 | 503.98 |
| SPEAKER_2 | On the second verse is to a pre con predetermined theta, we condemned or maybe with a book without an end, We're not stories. We're not actors. We're awake and in control and this is not a dream. So we can break the | 448.559375 | 520.42 |
| SPEAKER_3 | mold. | 521.04 | 521.11 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And and motion something new, forgetting what we know and evolution overdue. Fight the current, pull the rip cord, get away. | 465.12937500000004 | 527.88 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's good. That's cool. | 472.38937500000003 | 529.76 |
| SPEAKER_3 | And, | 475.85937499999994 | 476.179375 |
| SPEAKER_2 | of course, again, and road shot and pass are all we take. We need a storm. Let's pray for rain now. | 532.16 | 539.0999999999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. That, he killed me there. What? Pray | 484.75932499999993 | 542.7399499999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | for rain? | 542.7399499999999 | 543.4799999999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, we like, yes, we need a storm. Let's pray for rain as if, like, oh, God's gonna 9 No. Is he saying that or is he saying is he is it ironic he's saying that that's what we | 487.50937500000003 | 554.0699599999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | do? | 554.0699599999999 | 554.54 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Okay. | 498.559375 | 498.799375 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. | 554.78 | 555.17 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I | 555.17 | 555.42 |
| SPEAKER_3 | get it. | 555.42 | 555.86 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, saying, like, that's not how things | 500.11937499999993 | 557.54 |
| SPEAKER_2 | work? Saying, like, we stay we stay on well trodden paths. | 557.54 | 560.115 |
| SPEAKER_3 | We | 560.115 | 560.29 |
| SPEAKER_2 | stay on, like, the fucking drivers on following, you know, lemmings following each other off the cliff. | 504.549375 | 566.31 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Mhmm. | 566.31 | 566.81 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And then, like, we need a storm. Let's pray pray for rain, like, but then we need we need something to intervene. | 511.20933499999995 | 572.92 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. So you're not being | 572.9799999999999 | 574.1199499999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | ironic. | 574.17995 | 574.43 |
| SPEAKER_1 | He's not saying like, because that is what | 518.6893749999999 | 576.91 |
| SPEAKER_3 | we do all the time. | 576.91 | 577.31 |
| SPEAKER_1 | We just pray for things to | 577.31 | 578.43 |
| SPEAKER_3 | happen | 578.43 | 578.51 |
| SPEAKER_0 | and | 578.51 | 578.91 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it's there aren't ignorant too. | 578.91 | 580.43 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 525.0893749999999 | 525.5893749999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But | 525.7793449999999 | 526.2793449999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, he's not saying fucking be passive and pray for it. | 526.539415 | 585.3 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Kind of. Because it when you do that, when you pray for things that happen or pray for not bad things to happen that other people are very much in control of, that's giving a pass. Right? That's the way | 529.5593749999999 | 596.24 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you get the whole image that he's painting with his work. | 597.5 | 599.55 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Sorry, | 599.55 | 600.05 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Gypsy. | 600.27004 | 600.6999999999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So he says, we need a story we need | 547.3393749999999 | 605.3199999999999 |

| SPEAKER_1 | tell | 605.40004 | 605.90004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | let's pray for right now. Wash these roads away. Let's get off track and wander far. And some leads some roads lead to same roads lead to same destinations. So, like, | 550.9393749999999 | 620.7299999999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. I do. He's just | 565.529375 | 622.55 |
| SPEAKER_2 | using the storm euphemism as, like, something needs to change. | 622.55 | 626.4599999999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Oh, | 570.6993749999999 | 570.9343749999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I can't assist you. This well trained path. | 626.915 | 629.03 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. I know. I get it. I kinda get | 573.289375 | 631.1899599999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | it, | 631.1899599999999 | 631.27 |
| SPEAKER_1 | except it's not the storm part that was the issue. It's the what is the answer. And his his answer was to just | 631.27 | 637.5899999999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | pray, like, as in some higher being will be the one to do it. Right? | 581.769335 | 640.94997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Or | 640.94997 | 641.11 |
| SPEAKER_1 | no? | 641.11 | 641.61 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You're saying that we needed to, like, not be on this, like, we're not | 586.7093749999999 | 645.5899999999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | we need to stop assimilating and going and doing what we're told kind of thing. | 589.649375 | 648.5900399999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Right? | 648.5900399999999 | 648.9799999999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | He's just he's just going off the the the road chart in paths. | 592.9993749999999 | 652.7199999999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. Like like, it's | 652.78 | 653.8199999999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | a | 653.8199999999999 | 653.9799999999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | version of it's the definition of an kind of thing. And so, like, we're not gonna do discover anything new or do anything different or have anything different if we don't go off the path and just so let's wash away the the roads. Right? But then the analogy, I guess, or the the metaphor Who is responsible who is going to wash the roads and what who like, who laid these roads down? For us, | 653.9799999999999 | 682.99 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you know? | 682.99 | 683.3399999999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I guess, But I don't know. I feel like leaving it to miss Look at the power being who's not human, you know. I mean, I know that he's the lyrics were kind of like touching on that like before, so I feel like I don't know. | 627.3593749999999 | 696.9 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Just It is not. | 641.4793749999999 | 698.6899599999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I | 643.2793449999999 | 643.3593749999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | don't think he's being I don't I'm not saying that he's, | 699.3399999999999 | 701.74 |
| SPEAKER_5 | like, | 701.74 | 701.9799999999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | saying | 701.9799999999999 | 702.18 |
| SPEAKER_4 | anything about, like, leave it to God. I'm not saying that he's, like, saying that at all. I'm saying though, No. These are just things that we say and believe without even doing, like, thinking about it. I guess. Like, I'm not saying he's saying | 646.5994049999999 | 714.0699599999999 |
| SPEAKER_5 | anything. | 714.0699599999999 | 714.5699599999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, how fucking people used to believe that slavery was, like, the thing to do. | 659.1793749999999 | 720.3299999999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | No. I'm saying, like, him just saying, like, pray the rain pray it rains kind of thing. Even if you're not religious, like, people saying bless you to 1 another, even if they're not religious, it's kind of like, you know, don't really think about it. Like, why are who | 720.3299999999999 | 734.56 |
| SPEAKER_1 | why are you blessing you? We're not even, like, you know, Don't even have a Skydaddy to bless you to that we were trying to bless afraid that an | 734.6400299999999 | 742.88 |

| SPEAKER_4 | with it being not related to God necessarily. I understand what he's saying fully, but I just | 703.6893749999999 | 763.5699999999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | feel like there's | 707.5893749999999 | 764.7299999999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | information left out | 709.389375 | 766.77 |

| SPEAKER_1 | and we went and then we came back, and while we got in every place, and I'll go off. The car is a lamp and and then came back and I got them back. They to do it from her phone. But of course, I needed to use her phone to find my voice. That I could be like, oh, here's a number. To be able to find your phone if you I didn't know that my friend. No. I'm just saying my But, yeah, | 0 | 72.72062500000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Before. So but either way, so I had to wait until I got home and use my At So I did it, and it said that I mean, I was like so confused. I was like wait. Says it's on 1604. I mean, she's convinced that somebody's found it and then talked out the window. Like, why did somebody do that? It didn't even make any sense though. Granted, it doesn't make any sense to me that it was still on the fucking roof and also, like, I looked on the roof, I guess it just moved around on the roof, like, as we were driving. Driving, and I just didn't see it. I don't know. We were a hurry. Whatever. I don't know. But, like, somehow or another it was even with me looking for it on the fucking roof of her car. I don't know either way. But, so I used her phone, and then I, like, she got here, I found it, and I saw it. It was I was like, no fucking way. And so I trusted her device so that we could actually use it while we were, like, while we went there. So we went to 1604 and, about where it was on the map or said it was on the map. I mean, I didn't believe it was gonna be there Anyways, I just was like, this is no fucking way. And then for it to be accurate, I'll also, like, so accurate, it showed on the map exactly in the middle of the ditch. The cement ditch, going on to 1604 you can call there's whatever. I don't | 18.74999499320984 | 153.79063499320984 |

There's, like, there's not grass, it's not a grass medium or anything, it literally goes way down this v shape of just cement. So on the map like where I said it was, was like, well, the fact it still has find my phone enabled, like, Abel has to still be where functional. Yeah. And then, like, so she pulled them around his shoulder in front of the apartment complex. And I crossed the street. Across the, access road and then went into the ditch, and I was using her phone trying to figure out, okay, well, where am I? Because I guess it was because she doesn't have location services at all like activated, especially in the browser. So it wasn't telling me if I was anywhere near it. So I was just going based off of where the apartments were and just, like, where she showed on the map. And then so, like, I got to that area. I was like, okay. And sure enough, it was, like, on its it was on its face on the fucking, on the the side closest to the access road, that v that v wall, just on its face just chilling there, like, straight up, like, like it was, like, set there almost. What the fuck? Got it. Not no no new cracks. Nothing broken on it whatsoever. Fucking case is still on it. Mean, all 4 corners are fucked up for the case now, but it's perfectly fine. Can you see it?

| SPEAKER_1 | Uh-huh. | 326.919395 | 327.419395 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I thought you said something about | 327.71935500000006 | 384.90000000000003 |

| SPEAKER_2 | mean, if it happens again, then you'll know that that's | 367.91937500000006 | 426.38 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Should give her an opportunity to prove herself more so. I | 375.839375 | 379.509355 |
| SPEAKER_1 | think. | 435.48998 | 435.98998 |

| SPEAKER_1 | you're | 524.84 | 525.16 |
| SPEAKER_3 | missing | 525.16 | 525.66 |
| SPEAKER_2 | mistaken. So I don't know. I guess just if anything like that happens again | 469.979375 | 529.5600000000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. I saw that then. | 485.39934500000004 | 542.9200000000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I mean, because you're good. Even move it. She might she would still if she did it, she would still go looking for it in the same | 491.06937500000004 | 556.0400000000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | place. | 556.0400000000001 | 556.5400000000001 |

I seem to The pretty lucky The, fires are close by, but they are going in a direction away from my house. So I am in an evacuation zone but they downgraded it to a warning. I don't have to evacuate Some people from RedJob and stuff, they had to evacuate and stuff like that. It's pretty bad. Other people in Los Angeles are not as lucky as me though. This place it's really not looking good. There's especially in Pasadena, Pasadena is it It looks like a war zone. I mean, I know that's a a trite comparison, but it's true. It's entire neighborhoods just destroyed. Not looking good. So if you're gonna donate to somebody, you know, donate to people in Pacific Palisades and Malibu are pretty freaking destroyed as well.

| SPEAKER_3 | audiobook. This is | 248.57060499999997 | 250.03059499999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | manifesto of the communist party by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, published February 48, The work was written in late 18/47. The source is Marx Engels' selected works volume 1. Progress Publishers, Moscow 1969, translated by Samuel Moore in cooperation with Friedrich Engels 18/88, transcribed by zodiac in Brian Baggins, proved and corrected against the 18 and and copy left Marxist Internet Archive at marxist.org 1980 72,02010. Thanks to marxist.org for making this PDF available. I wanna mention also before we get into the actual body text, that this edition has a number of prefaces and an editorial introduction. I'm not gonna read those right now. They are valuable documents written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. As prefaces to various editions from 18 seventies to the 18 nineties of as manifesto was translated into different European languages, They would comment. And then later after Marx died, Engels alone would comment. I've those separately in a file I believe called prefaces to the communist manifesto. Those are valuable in and of themselves. I just wanna wanted to do them separately, so please go look up that video if you're interested. Now let's get into the manifesto of the Communist Party. Section 1, bourgeois and proletarians. The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guildmaster and journeyman, a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on and uninterrupted, now hidden, now open, fight, a fight that each time ended either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the contending classes. In the earlier epics of history, find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders. Manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome, we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves. In the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guildmasters, journeymen apprentices, surf, in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations. The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epic, the epic of the bourgeoisie, possesses how this distinct feature. It has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into 2 great hostile camps, into 2 great classes directly facing each other, bourgeoisie and proletariat. From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burgers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses, the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed. The discovery of America, the rounding | 194.75999999999996 | 440.33062500000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of the cape, | 440.33062500000005 | 441.15059500000007 |
| SPEAKER_2 | opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East Indian and Chinese market colonization of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange in commodities generally gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known and thereby to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development. The feudal system of industry in which industrial production was monopolized by closed deals, now a longer supply for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its | 385.67999999999995 | 476.73242500000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | place. | 476.73242500000003 | 477.140625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The Guildmasters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class. Division of power between the different corporate guilds vanished in face of division of labor in each single workshop. Meanwhile, the markets kept ever growing. The demand ever rising. Even manufacturer no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionized industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by the giant modern industry. The place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois. Modern industry has established the world market for which the discovery of America paved the way. | 421.80003 | 519.330625 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Why the rights to | 0 | 0.7199999999999989 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and it happens all the time. Corporations are able to do it at scale. These mega corporations often have diverse holdings in many different industries. Which means media companies have to be very careful about who controls | 3.8100000000000023 | 24.060000000000002 |
| SPEAKER_0 | their step | 24.060000000000002 | 24.630000000000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Dangerous side effect of a common household cleaner. The only problem is the company that manufactures that cleaner advertises on your platform, so you report on the story. Well, you're welcome to try, but you must let should be fired for violating the number one rule of business. Don't mess with the money. So what does this mean? It means the news companies are heavily incentivized to play nice with the insurance industry, the auto industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and whoever else might wanna advertise on their platforms. So that's principle number 2. Principle number 4 Just a bit of a personal question. Where does news actually come from? I mean, there's no, like, news line or reporters go to excavate stories. No. Reporters have to go out into the world to source their story. So in order to tap into a steady flow of credible information and state business, use corporations have to play nice with think tanks, with government with corporations. In other words, they have to cozy up to the rich, powerful, or risk getting cut off from that sweet | -18.970628999999995 | 103.48999999999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | news juice. And | 103.48999999999998 | 104.71000000000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | since powerful organizations and institutions have a much greater ability generate flak, news companies naturally steer away from saying | 49.04938500000001 | 113.82 |
| SPEAKER_2 | any | 113.82 | 114.10999999999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | thing that could put them on the bad side of the rich and powerful. In To avoid being branded as terrorists, communist sympathizers, or whatever else, media companies must toe the line drawn by governments, the defense industry, and their corporate owned owners and advertisers. So that's principle number 3. News companies are beholden their sources. And these rules go for all media outlets. Especially the major corporate outlets where most of your information is likely to originate. Oh, but, Harper, I don't watch the news. I get my information from TikTok and Instagram meme pages. Yeah. Well, where do you think those content creators source their information from? Santa Claus? The truth is, while the digital revolution has opened up some opportunities, for independent journalism, the overall information situation has actually gotten more dire as the years have gone on. However bad you say | 58.68936499999999 | 171.10999999999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | the control | 171.10999999999999 | 171.51999999999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | is, | 171.51999999999998 | 172.01999999999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it's probably worse. In 1983, 90% of media outlets were controlled by just 50 corporate corporations. Today, that number is just 6. What you see it, you cannot see it. The corporate press district to say our paper, we have freedom speech. But if you can control what people say, there's no reason to control what they can say. Okay. So maybe our media is Maybe we're not as free as we think we are. Maybe we don't have control over a massive segment of our society. But, hey, I mean, at least we still get | 116.61937499999999 | 213.76 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to vote. | 213.76 | 214.26 |
| SPEAKER_1 | We still have control over the political part of society. Right? Actually, Don't answer that. | 158.279375 | 220.45 |
| SPEAKER_3 | You thirsty? Of course, you're thirsty. Look. Let's get a glass of milk. Now you want your milk? In a red cup? Or in the blue cup. See what I did there? | 164.62938499999998 | 232.35 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Pay attention to the you're not getting. | 179.489375 | 238.16 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Maybe you want a juice or beer. | 238.16 | 239.51000000000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't | 239.51000000000002 | 240.07998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | know. | 240.07998 | 240.28 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Who's watching this. I need to pay better attention. To my | 184.539355 | 242.9 |
| SPEAKER_3 | audio. Maybe you | 242.9 | 243.71 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to pick between bad and worse same system. And | 194.81937499999998 | 255.58 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that system is considered justified because we chose it. Even if both the choices we're being presented with | 255.58 | 262.6 |
| SPEAKER_1 | are rotten. | 262.74 | 263.71000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But the point | 207.88937499999997 | 264.75 |
| SPEAKER_2 | stands, | 264.75 | 264.98998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | we do get to decide however constrained | 264.98998 | 267.88998000000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that choice may be. But does our choice matter? | 212.32939499999998 | 271.45000000000005 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Does it affect political outcomes? You don't actually have political power. Rarely, if ever, will you get to directly vote on an issue that affects your life. So when you're only | 271.67 | 283.70000000000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | able to | 283.70000000000005 | 284.21000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | elect people who will exercise power on your behalf, it kinda matters whether or not they do what you want them to do. So do a representative actually represent | 228.46935500000004 | 238.73937499999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | us? | 294.72 | 295 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Let's take a closer look. A democratic government is supposed to be of the people for the people, by the people. Of course, our system brutally fails. That first test. Our representatives are not nothing like us, at least demographically. But, a, if our makers represent us politically, maybe it doesn't matter if they don't represent us personally. However, as I think you'll see, that's a big if. Because in order to legislate candidates must first be elected. And on that front, the data is clear. The poll The politicians with the money get elected, and that money overwhelmingly comes from big business and the rich, not the working people. But the rich aren't paying for candidates. They're paying for policy. They're getting it. When you examine the voting patterns of lawmakers, you'll find that there much more likely to deliver for their donors than they are to deliver for their constituents. Again, the data reveals what we all intuitively know. | 295 | 345.6 |
| SPEAKER_1 | If the rich want it done, it will be. If the poor want it done, they're likely to get empty promises. This | 345.6 | 350.88 |
| SPEAKER_3 | sad reality is what people like you and I see is just a puppet show. One more | 295.29937500000005 | 355.82998000000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | thing. | 355.82998000000003 | 356.16 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Notice how that separation between public and private doesn't exist anymore? It exists for civilians like you, but not for big business and not for the 1%. Power is a | 300.41937500000006 | 367.27000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | one | 367.27000000000004 | 367.45000000000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | way street. | 313.38939500000004 | 369.97 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Hopefully, these points have showed that we have a very narrow definition of freedom and democracy. This country. We have the freedom to consume, but not much else. | 315.34935500000006 | 380.89000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And | 380.89000000000004 | 381.20000000000005 |
| SPEAKER_3 | have the freedom to vote, but not much else. But the question remains, if America America isn't a democracy, then what is it? You probably think you know where I'm going with this. America is an oligarchy where the rich make | 325.459375 | 393.53000000000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | decisions. They control the state, the media, and the economy. Well, not quite. The reality of this situation is actually | 337.789355 | 400.53002000000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | much worse. | 400.53002000000004 | 401.19 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I would say that in our system, the rich have control, but they don't have power. To illustrate my point, let's do a thought experiment. Let's say you're a miser capitalist. And one night, as capitalists sometimes do, you get the Ebony scourge treatment. You're visited by 3 ghosts, and you're scared straight. You vowed | 345.209375 | 418.91 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to | 418.91 | 419.07000000000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | stop | 419.07000000000005 | 419.47 |
| SPEAKER_3 | exploiting | 419.47 | 419.97 |
| SPEAKER_1 | your workers, to stop interfering in the political process, and to support independent media. | 364.239375 | 424.39000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Then | 424.39000000000004 | 424.63 |
| SPEAKER_3 | when you wake up the next morning, you find that to your surprise, every single other corrupt politician | 424.63 | 430.29 |
| SPEAKER_1 | major business leader on the planet, has had the same | 374.93937500000004 | 433.54 |
| SPEAKER_3 | experience. So if this happened, if every single person in power suddenly changed their mind, things would be great. All the problems that I brought up would be solved. Right? Well, not exactly. I think things might be not | 377.79937500000005 | 449.88 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Question is, replaced by who? If the people who | 481.430405 | 484.060405 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Recommendation speech | 96.26999999999998 | 102.53999999999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | in this empty field. The reason for reading it in English is so that a maximum number of present might understand the words. Hopefully, the spirit of the original text will be seen 2 have been respected. Some things have changed in the intervening 70 years as the naturally will. The 28th March 1946, audience members were charged 60¢. For admission and students only 30¢. The date that year fell on a Thursday, while this one falls on a Monday, For what it might be worse, I was born in the city on a Monday. Feeling surrealism and to throw that in. And it was raining as it was this morning. So I'm told What has also changed since that 19, 1946, is the audience for governor's speech. And presumably its expectations, world views, and understanding of the author and his work. One thing that holds true today as I did 70 years ago is | 102.53999999999996 | 226.99062500000002 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Against fanaticism and violence and in favor of secularism Arjod was credited with the following words. M o. Silence. Is death. If you remain silent, you die. And if you speak, you die. So to speak, and Can you, can you also give the speech, I'm told, at Brooklyn College and at Harvard And on those occasions, he made some pre speech remarks. Although he is said to have omitted them when he spoke here, I gonna include them tonight because they allude not without his characteristic humor, to the difficult negotiations he had with the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs | 311.15109698000003 | 368.67109700000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | was apparently concerned that he would be too political and wanted him to stick at exclusively to the subjects of theater and literature. | 311.140472 | 375.511097 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Mhmm. | 376.211097 | 376.711097 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Apologize for making a relatively long speech just a little longer, but I think it it'll give historical interest to some of you. To have that preamble as well. With that, mister when I was invited to give a series of lectures in the United States of America, I felt some doubt and hesitation. Alright, honey. Come on. I'm really not old enough to give lectures and I am more at ease with the process of thinking than I am making categorical statements. Since I don't feel I have any claim on what is generally called the truth. | 321.660482 | 411.52110100000004 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Literature and theater philosophy. Research, and the efforts of an entire nation are merely reflections of a fundamental question of a struggle for life and for humanity. That preoccupies us in this moment. The French people sense that mankind is still under threat, and they also sense that to continue living, they must grab a certain idea of mankind from the crisis that grips the whole world. Out of loyalty to my country, I've chosen to speak about this human crisis. Since I'm here to talk about what I know the best I can do is sketch as clearly as I can the moral experience of my generation. Because we have seen the entire world crisis unfold and our experience might shed a glimmer of light, on the fate of mankind and on some aspects of | 487.488147 | 533.978147 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Their country They were nourished on shame and lived by rebellion. Yes. This is an interesting generation. Faced with the absurd world its elders had concocted, believed in nothing and yearned to rebel. The literature of its time was in revolt against lucidity, against narrative, and against the very idea of a sentence. Painting was abstract. That is to say it was rebelling against figurativism realism, and simple harmony. Music was rejecting was was rejecting melody, And as for philosophy, it taught us that there was no truth, only phenomena. That mister Smith monsieur Duvall, might all exist as phenomena, but without these 3 particular phenomena having anything The moral attitude of our generation was even more categorical. Nationalism seemed an outmoded truth | 594.407526 | 651.347526 |
| SPEAKER_1 | politics had taught us to question any notion of purity. And to conclude that no one was ever wrong because everyone might be right As for our society's traditional morality, it seemed to us that it hadn't stopped being what it had always been. A monstrous hypocrisy. Thus, we lived in negation. Of course, that was nothing new. Other generations and other countries have experienced this in other periods of history. But what is new here is that these same men strangers to any traditional values, had been forced to adapt their personal positions to a context of murder and terror. The situation led them to believe there might be a human crisis. As they had to live the most wrenching of contradictions. This was because they entered the war as one enters hell. If it is true that hell is denial, they love neither war nor violence, yet they had to accept war and practice violence. They hated nothing except hatred yet they were forced to learn that difficult science. They had to deal with terror. Or rather terror dealt with them. They found themselves confronted with a situation that rather than try to describe it in general terms, I would like to illustrate through 4 short stories about a time the world is beginning to forget. But what still burns in our hearts 1, in an apartment building occupied by the Gestapo in a European capital 2 accused men still bleeding find themselves tied up after a night of interrogation. The concierge of the building begins her careful household chores. Good spirits since she probably just finished breakfast. Approached by one of the tortured men she replies indignantly. I never interfere with my tenant's business. 2, In Lyon, one of my comrades is dragged from his cell for a third round of questioning. Since his ears have been badly torn during a previous session, he is wearing a bandage around his head. The German officer who interrogates him is the same man who conducted the previous sessions. With an air of affection and concern, how are your ears doing? 3, In Greece, after an underground resistance operation, a German officer prepares the execution of 3 brothers he has taken as hostages. Their old mother throws herself at his feet and he agrees to save one of them. But only on the condition that she designate which one She chooses the oldest because he has a family. But her choice condemns the 2 others. Just as the German officer intended. 4, A group of deported women including one of our comrades, is repatriated to France by way of Switzerland. As soon as they enter Swiss territory, they notice a funeral taking place. And the mere sight of this spectacle sets off their hysterical laughter. That's how the dead are treated here. They say. I've chosen these stories because they allow me to respond with something other than a conventional yes, To the question, is there a human crisis? They allow me to reply just as the man I was speaking about replied. Yes. There is a human crisis because in today's world, we can contemplate the death or the torture of a human being with a feeling of indifference. Friendly concern, scientific interest, or simple passivity. Yes. There is a human crisis, Since putting a person to death can be regarded with something other than the horror and scandal it ought to provoke, Since human suffering is accepted as a somewhat boring obligation, on a par with getting supplies or having a having a stand in line for an ounce of butter. It's too easy in this matter to simply accuse Hitler and say that since the beast is dead, its venom is gone. We know perfectly well that the venom is not gone. That each of us each of us can carries it in our own hearts. And we can sense this by the way that nations political parties, and individuals continue to regard one another with vestiges of anger. I have always believed that a nation is accountable for its traitors as well for its heroes. But likewise, civilizations, the white man, civilization in particular, are as responsible for their perversions as for their successes. In this light, we are all answerable for the legacy of Hitler and must attempt to discuss discover the most general causes of the terrible evil that has eaten away at the face of Europe. Let us try then with the help of the four stories I have told to enumerate the most obvious symptoms of the crisis. The first symptom is the rise of terror. A consequence of the perversion of values through which human beings and historical forces are judged not in terms of their dignity, but in terms of their success. The modern crisis is inevitable. Because no one in the west can be sure about their immediate future. And all live with a more or less defined fear that they will be crushed to bits one way or another. By history. To save this miserable man, this modern day Job for from perishing of his wounds on his own dunghill, We must first lift the burden of fear and anxiety he can rediscover the freedom of thought he'll need to resolve any of the problems facing the modern conscience. This crisis has also been | 594.826901 | 994.777526 |
| SPEAKER_0 | The Greek mother I spoke about could not persuade the German officer that he had no right to force her into heartbreak. He says, and the German officer no longer represented men or mankind, but rather an instinct elevated to the status of an idea or a theory. Passion, even deadlier passion, would have been preferable. For passion runs its course, And another passion, another cry from the flesh or the heart might replace it. But a man capable of tender concern for years that he has only torn is not passionate. He's a mathematical calculation that cannot be restrained or reasoned with. This crisis is also about replacing real things with printed matter. That is to say the growth of bureaucracy. Contemporary man tends more and more to put between himself and nature an abstract and complex | 1023.8323069999999 | 1080.342307 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Per capita? Alright. Let's see. You don't know what I mean. I I don't really know. Off the top, can I head? Per capita my head per person per person? It's the population. | 9.649999000000001 | 27.25 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Oh, | 28.429999000000002 | 28.669999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | per capita. Means you are you are adjusting for population size. That's how we compare numbers between large population countries and small ones. Use per capita numbers so that you take population into account. So this, like so when you go, we have a larger population. Yep. That's why for capita number, exist to take that into account. Oh, so that's just the average. So they'd average it. Per capita's not really I | 28.669999 | 57.4 |
| SPEAKER_2 | of a country is up in his the average or standard of living of | -1.000625 | 59.33 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yep. When we're when we're doing per capita per person, you're looking at the number per, like, every 1,000 or every 10,000 or every 100,000. So it's just a way to even out those to even out those numbers. But literally in in, like, all, like, every in, like, like, every ranking, like, you like, Cuba's does better than us in health care in, like, every ranking. | 4.779377999999993 | 83.579995 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's okay. Good. You know, like, it's and just you can't really, like, compare Cuba than America. You | 29.329375 | 91.58 |

| SPEAKER_2 | succeeding on. Like, the economy like, is in ruins. | 99.03999400000001 | 103.35 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, why is the people watching me in ruins? | 47.609375 | 106.09 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Okay. Why the economy is the driven? So what happened to Cuba in the past, like, 2 years? I cannot hear you over the Can you tell me what happened in Q? | 51.41937 | 118.82000000000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I I can't hear you over the noise. | 118.82000000000001 | 120.39 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Urging onto the highway while also having a debate because I have to get to work. There we go. So, yeah, so Cuba so they're at, like, way back, like, whenever people just have a leg it goes back to, like, you know, whenever, when it's Pinal Castro and, like, keep started his regime. And, like, they they turned the points so socialism and, like, oh, you know, we're gonna prosper. So then Cuba, like, all of this are ruined. Because of, like, Fidel, like, what did you do? What was that? What if Marco say you couldn't change it? Like, the US. | 68.079381 | 172.11999999999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You quite literally know nothing about Cuban history. So let me give you a quick a quick rundown on history. In the early 1800 in the early 1800, Cuba was was occupied by Spain. Spain occupied Cuba. Spain was taking Cuba's money and land crops. Spain was doing this. America in, back to Cuba for a Cuban revolution away from Spain, and they did this. They did this in, like, the early the early 18 100. Right? America backed Spamba in a revolution. A week. I was gonna say a week after a week after a week after Cuba broke from Spain occupation, America occupied occupied Cuba. A week. They gave Cuba a week, and then America took over. Okay? So this was in 18 this was in, specifically, 18/20. Okay? Okay? America occupied Cuba until 18 19. Under America occupied under American occupation of Cuba.

You're not taking into account the material conditions that Cubans were in which led to the rise of Castro, the ousting of the United States, and the starting of a 70 year long embargo, which is barred Cuba for trade with the rest of the globe. So to claim Cuba is in an economic and economic turmoil because of what Cuba did is, a, historic, and ignores the material conditions that were in place before Cuba even gained independence.

| SPEAKER_2 | Penguin Random House Audio presents Lucky Loser. How Donald Trump squandered his father's fortune. And created the illusion of success. By Russ Buettner and Suzanne Craig. Read for you by Gabor Zachman. From Russ. For Stacy. My love, and Emma, our light. From Suzanne. For Gary Park. My first editor, Introduction. The week before the 2016 presidential election, Donald j Trump took a break from campaigning to attend the ceremonial opening of his new hotel a few blocks from the White House. | 16.82000000000005 | 118.04062500000009 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Donald, | 63.020000000000095 | 63.210000000000036 |
| SPEAKER_2 | his wife Melania, and his 4 grown children posed for photographers in their new presidential ballroom. Clutching scissors at the edge of a long red ribbon. Bearing the Trump name. Don Junior, Ivanka, and Eric. All in their thirties. Were by then experienced ribbon cutters. They'd each joined their father's business early in his star turn on The Apprentice. When his newfound fame made licensing the use of his name a core focus of the company. They had spent years traveling the world, posing with a shovel or a pair of scissors, and a developer paying to use the Trump name. The Trumps refer to those buildings as their jobs. But the burdens of the work the decision making, overseeing construction, all the financial risks fell to other companies. This day represented a throwback to a time when the Trump name on a building signified that it had been built by Donald Trump. Back in 2012, the Trumps had won a bidding war lease and redevelop the old post office building. An ornate Romanesque revival building with a clock tower piercing the city skyline. They committed to spending at least $200,000,000 and paying base rent starting at $3,000,000 a year. The Trump offer was so high that it gave a jolt to the government official overseeing the process and compelled other bidders mostly major hotel chains, to protest that only a naive believe he would ever make a profit. At the time, Trump acknowledged he was paying too for the old post office. But now standing in his new ballroom as the republican nominee, He described his family's work on the hotel as the latest exam of why he should be elected president. Today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country. Trump said during the ceremony. I've been very lucky and I've led a great life. | 63.210000000000036 | 224.6406250000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. | 168.8199400000001 | 169.3199400000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Now I want to give back to the country which I love so much. And has been so good to me. The truth of Trump's metaphor would remain hidden in his private records for years. What he had accomplished was to spend so much on the project that he would never make money running it. He would be forced to pump 1,000,000 of dollars a year into the hotel accounts to cover his losses. It was, by then, a defining pattern of his career. The one unknown to the outside world. He would eventually be forced to sell. And even that apparent windfall would not be what it seemed. Throughout the campaign, Trump's most repeated argument for his candidacy leaned on his life and business, which he framed as one man's triumphant rise from modest beginnings. He typically mentioned his father Brett Seattuck, as a miniaturized contrast to his own enormity. During Trump's first debate with the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, she pivoted from a question on economic policy to deride Trump as a child of wealth. Donald was very fortunate in his life. And that's all to his benefit. Trump took no offense at Clinton mocking his economic policy as trumped up trickled down. He could not, however, tolerate Clinton's suggestion that any factor other than his own genius made him rich enough to affix his name to golf courses. Apartment buildings, casinos, Hotels. And dress shirts. My father gave me a very small loan in 1975. And I built it into a company that's worth many, many | 169.8900000000001 | 321.19062500000007 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Chapter 11, tendencies to fascism in Western Europe and America. Until the last few years, liberalism and social democracy denied the possibility of fascism in the, quote, civil countries of Western Europe and America. As early as 1922. Immediately after the victory of fascism Italy while current discussions still treated this as a, quote, Italian Chapter 8, capital and circle. Chapter 6, simple and compound labor. Chapter 7, capital and surplus value. Hey. Welcome to Socialism For All. Political economy, comes the action of political economy in the widest sense the science of the laws governing the production and exchange of the material means of subsistence in human society. Production and exchange are two different functions. Production may occur without exchange. But exchange being necessarily an exchange of products, cannot occur without production. Each of these two social functions is subject to the action of external influences. To a great extent peculiar to it, and for this reason each has, also to a great extent, its own special laws. But on the other hand, they come constantly determine and influence each other to such an extent that might be termed the abcissa and coordinate, the economic curve. The conditions under which men produce and exchange vary from country to country. Within each country, again, from generation to generation. Political economy, therefore, cannot be the same for all countries. And for all historical epics. A tremendous distance separates the bow and arrow the stone knife, and the acts of exchange among savages occurring only by way of exception, on the steam engine of a 1,000 horsepower, mechanical loom the railways, and the Bank of England. The inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego have not got so far as mass production of world trade any more than they have experience of Jobbing. Or a stock exchange crash. Anyone who attempted to bring the political economy of Tierra del Puego under the same laws our operative in present day England. Would obviously produce nothing but the most banal common A historical science. It deals with material which is historical. That is constantly changing. It must first investigate the special laws of each individual stage in the evolution of production and exchange, and only when it has complete this investigation will it be able to establish the few quite general laws which hold good for production and exchange in general. At the same time, it goes without saying that the laws which are Valid for definite old good for all historic the introduction of metallic money brought into operation a series of laws to remain valid for all countries and historical epics Which all civilized peoples enter history. Large and small scale at | 266.3999600000001 | 540.470625 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Groups of communities of the same tribe had an first arrived at only in order to safeguard their common interests. A g irrigation and East and for protection against external enemies. From this stage on, we're requires just as much a function of maintaining by force the conditions of existence Domination the ruling class, against the subject class. Distribution, however, is not a merely passive production and exchange. It, in its turn, reacts upon both things. Each new mode of production or form of which correspond to them. But also by the old mode of distribution. It can secure the distribution which is suitable to it only in the course of a long struggle. But the more mobile a given mode of production and exchange, more capable it is of perfection and development, the more rapidly does distribution reach the stage at which it outgrows its progenitor. Hitherto prevailing mode of production and exchange, comes into conflict with it. The old primitive communities, which have already been mentioned, could remain | 622.700867 | 687.6408670000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | before intercourse with the outside world gave rise in their midst, to the inequalities of property as a result of which they began to break up. On the contrary, modern capitalist production, | 622.8502420000001 | 688.790867 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Always reflected in popular instinct. So long as a mode of production still describes an ascending curve of development, It is enthusiastic welcomed even by those who come up worst from its corresponding motive distribution. Was the case with the English workers in the beginnings of modern industry. And even while this mode of production remains normal for society, there is in general contentment with the distribution. And if objections to it begin to be raised, these come from within the ruling class itself. They find no I'm | 732.0087159999999 | 746.588091 |
| SPEAKER_1 | response whatever among the exploited masses. Only when the mode of production in question has already described a good part of its descending curve. When it has half outlived its day. When the conditions of its existence have to a large extent disappeared, and its successor is already knocking at the door, It's only at this stage that the constantly increasing inequality of distribution appears as unjust. It is only then appeal was made facts have had their day, so called eternal justice. From a scientific standpoint, this appeal to morality and justice does not help us an inch further. Moral indignation however, justifiable, cannot serve economic science as an argument. Only as a symptom The task of economic science is rather to show that the social abuses to recently been developing a necessary concept of production. But at the same time, also indications its approaching dissolution. And to reveal within the already dissolving economic form of motion the elements of future new organization of production and exchange, which will put an end to those abuses, which creates the Oh, it is absolutely in place in describing these abuses. Also, in attacking those apostles of harmony in the service of the ruling class, either deny or palliate them. How little it proves that any particular case is evident from the fact that in every epic of past history, there's been no lack of material for such wrath. So a comment. I think that a lot of this is gonna be self explanatory. Particularly if you're listening to this as part of one of the recommended reading lists, which has it, you know, more toward the middle or end. Just to touch on this last point about the wrath which creates the poet. In other words, outrage at the injustices of class society. It's appropriate and it's also appropriate to attack the people who say no class society is fine. Definitely isn't. But Ingalls is making the point here that that wrath in and of itself doesn't prove anything. Particularly as every period of class aside has caused for such outrage or creates cause for such outrage. As Engel says, the task of economic science is rather to show that the social abuses, which have recently been developing, whatever they are in a particular period, are necessary consequences of the existing mode of production, but also at the same time indications of its approaching etcetera. In other words, speaking to the underlying material causes of these unjust kinds of social organization and then how to get out of them About what's going on with politics. They seem to be very tuned into, like, the Democratic Party, for example, and, you know, what's happening with Trump or whoever it is. At the moment And what I tried to communicate to these people is these are the consequences of capitalism's breakdown the politics that you see are expressions of the ruling class trying to maintain their system, and you're not gonna get anything fundamentally different out of it until we strike to actually chain promote its production and so on. Because again, as Engel said, from a scientific standpoint, the appeal to morality and justice doesn't help us an inch further. Moral indignation may be justifiable, But it's not an argument. It's just a symptom. So it's real and it's valid, but it's not a solution to anything. We need socialism to actually get at the root causes and move on out of capitalism and class society. Continuing. Political economy, however, as the science of the conditions and forms under which the various human societies have produced and exchanges and on this basis have distributed their products Political economy in this wider sense has still to be brought into being. Such economic science as we possess up to the present is limited almost exclusively to the genesis and development of the capitalist mode of production. It begins with a critique of the survivals of the feudal forms of production and exchange, shows the necessity of the replacement by capitalist form, then develops the laws of the capitalist mode of production and its corresponding forms of exchange in their positive aspects. That is the aspects in which they furthered the general aims of society, ends with a socialist critique of the capitalist mode of production. That is with an exposition of its laws their negative aspects. But the demonstration that this mode of production by virtue of its own development, drives toward the point at which it makes itself impossible. This critique proves that the capitalist forms of production and exchange become more and more an intolerable fetter on production itself, that the mode of distribution necessarily determined by those forms has produced a situation among the classes which is daily becoming more intolerable. The antagonism sharpening from day to day, between capitalists constantly decreasing in number, constantly growing richer, and property less wage workers numbers constantly increasing, whose conditions taken as a whole are steadily to 2 the capitalist mode of production the latter can no longer master, are only waiting to be taken possession of by a society for cooperative work on a planned basis to ensure 2 all members of society the means of existence and of the 3 development of their capacities, and indeed, in constantly increasing measure. In order to complete this critique of bourgeois economics, an acquainted with the capitalist form of production, exchange, and distribution did not suffice. The forms which had preceded it or those which still exist alongside it in less developed countries had also, at least in their main features, to be examined and compared. Such an investigation and comparison as up to the present undertaken in general outline only by March. We therefore owe almost exclusively to his researchers all that has so far been established concerning pre bourgeois theory theoretical economics. Although it first took shape in the minds of a few men of genius toward the end of 17th century, Political economy in the narrower sense and its positive formula by the physiocrats and Adam Smith is nevertheless essential a child of the 18th century. And ranks with the achievements of the contemporary great French philosophers of the enlightenment. Sharing with them all the merits and demerits of that period. What we have said of the philosophers is also true of the economists of that time. To them, the new science was not the expression of the conditions and requirement of their epic, but the expression of eternal reason. The laws of production and exchange discovered by this science were not laws of a historically determined form of those but eternal laws of nature. Were deduced from the nature of man. But this man, examined more closely, proved to be the average burger of that epic on the way to becoming a bourgeois. And his nature consisted manufacturing and trading in accordance with the historically determined conditions of that period. So commenting here, Ingalls is reiterating the earlier point that you can't try to express eternal law when we're talking about historical changing conditions. Other words, these conditions and the laws of the activity performed in them are products of their time. So they may not apply outside of that time period if different behaviors are being performed. Owing to material conditions. So this is why we always go back to material conditions which change over the millennia. And then the general intelligence and adaptability and flexibility of humanity reshapes society in accordance with the new technologies and ways of material survival. So this is again reflective of materialism versus idealism. In the philosophical and epistemological approach other words, he's saying that these economists are basically trying to find some eternal ideal that is manifesting in these conditions, but actually know It's the conditions which are primary and then the society evolves around that, and it changes from period to period. So, yes, humans have certain instincts | 746.908091 | 1303.568716 |
| SPEAKER_0 | and | 1304.108716 | 1304.368716 |
| SPEAKER_1 | nutritional requirements, and there are certain things that are fixed about human beings. However, we're pretty flexible when it comes to social reorganization and language and other things like that, which are secondary and much quicker adaptations to the more fixed material conditions. Anyway, continuing. That we've acquired sufficient knowledge of our layer of critical foundations, paired during and his method in the philosophical field, it will not be difficult for us to foretell the way in which he will handle economy. In philosophy, insofar as his writings were not simply dribble, as in his philosophy of nature, his mode of outlook was a distortion of that of the 18th century. It was not a question of historical laws of development but laws of nature, eternal truths. Social relations such as morality and law were determined according to him not by the actual historical conditions of the age, but by the famous 2 men, one of whom either oppresses the other or does not. Though the latter alternative, sad to say, has never yet come to pass. We are therefore hardly likely to go astray if we conclude that her daring will trace political economy also back to final and ultimate truths. Eternal natural laws, the most empty and barren tautological axioms. Nevertheless, he will smuggle in again by the back door the whole positive content of political economy. So far as this is known to him, | 1248.948091 | 1388.348716 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Higher order which have already been consummated in a higher field of investigation, unquote. Everywhere the same important eulogy of himself. Everywhere, hairduring is triumphant over what hairduring has established and put out. Put out. Yes. We have seen to it to surf it, but put out in the way that people put out a sputtering candle. There's an editor's note that in German, this is an untranslatable play on words. Hausmacher, means consummate and also to put out. Continuing. Immediately afterwards, we find, quote, the most general natural laws governing all economy, unquote. So our forecast was right. But these natural laws permit of a correct understanding of history only if they are, quote, investigated in that more precise determination, which their results have through the political forms of subjection and grouping. Institutions such as slavery and wage bondage along with which is associated their | 1415.014837 | 1473.3448369999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | constitutional forms of a purely political nature and have hitherto constituted the frame within which the consequences of the natural economic laws could alone manifest themselves. Unquote. This sentence is the fanfare which, like a light motif in Wagner's opera announces the approach of the famous 2 men, but it is more than this. It is the basic theme of her daring's entire book. In the sphere of law Herdurian could not offer us anything except a bad translation of Rousseau's theory of equal into the language of socialism. Such as one has long been able to hear much more effectively rendered in any workers' tavern in Paris. Now he gives us an equally bad socialist translation of The Economist's Lament over the distortion of the eternal natural economic laws and of their effects owing to the intervention of the state, of force. And in this, her daring stance does absolutely alone among socialists. Every socialist worker, no matter of what nationality, knows quite well that force only protects exploitation but does not cause it. That the relation between capital and wage labor the basis of his exploitation and that this was brought about by purely economic causes, not at all by means of force. Then we are further told that in all economic questions, quote, the two process that of production and that of distribution, can be distinguished, unquote. Also, that JV say, notorious for his superficiality, mentioned in addition a third process, that of consumption. But that he was unable to say anything sensible about it. Any more than his successors and that exchange or circulation is, however, only a department of production which comprises all the operations Required the products to reach the ultimate consumer, the consumer proper. By confounding the 2 essentially different, also mutually dependent processes of production and circulation, and unblushingly asserting that the avoidance of this confusion can only, quote, give rise her daring merely shows that he either does not know or does not understand the colossal development which precisely circulates has undergone, during the last 50 years. As indeed is further borne out by the rest of his book. But this is not all. After just lumping together production and exchange into one, simply production, he puts distribution alongside the 2nd only external process, which has nothing whatever to do with the first. We have seen that distribution its decisive features is always the necessary result of the production and exchange relation of a particular society, as well as of the historical conditions in which the society arose so much so that when we know these relations and conditions, we can confidently and the mode of distribution which prevails in this society. But we see also that if hairdeering does not want to be unfaithful to the principles established by him, he's subject to the morality of law, history. He is compelled to deny this elementary economic fact. Especially if he is to smuggle his indispensable 2 men in economics. And once distribution has been happily freed of all connection with production and exchange, this great event can come to pass. Let us first recall how hairdeering developed his argument in the field of morality and law. He started originally with 1 man, and he said, quote, 1 man conceived as being alone or what is effect the same out of all connection with other men, can have no obligations. Such a man, there can be no question of what he thought, but only of what he wants to do. Unquote. Now commenting, that's immediately incorrect because you have natural needs and instincts. So there are things that you ought to do, in fact, for proper self care and maintenance just off the bat. Even if no one else exists, But anyway, let's see where Engels takes this. But what is this man conceived as being alone and without but the faithful primordial Jew out of the paradise where he is without Send because there is no possibility for him to commit any. However, even this atom of the philosophy of reality is destined to fall into So Alongside this atom, there suddenly appears not its true and Eve with rippling tresses, but a second atom. And instantly, Adam acquires obligations and breaks them. Instead of treating his brother as having civil rights and clasping him to his breast, he subjects him to his domination. He makes a slave of them. And it is the consequences of this first sin original sin of the enslavement of man, from which the world has suffered through the whole course of history down to the point of day. Is precisely what makes her daring think world history and not worth a pardon. Incidentally, Herdern considered that he had brought the quote sufficiently into contempt by characterizing it as a copy of the old people original sin redemption. But what are we to say of his latest version of the same story? For in due time, we shall, to use an expression of the reptile strength, get down to brass packs of redemption as well. All we can say is that we prefer the old Semitic tribal legend according to which it was worthwhile for the man and woman to abandon the state of innocence, and that Tehared Dearing will be left unconcerned which With 2 men. Let us now see how he translates this original sin into economic terms. Quote, we can get an appropriate cogitative scheme, the idea of production from the conception of a Robinson Crusoe, is facing nature alone with his own resources. It's not to share with anyone else. Equally appropriate to illustrate what is most essential in the ID of distribution is the cogitative scheme of 2 persons, who combine their economic forces, must evidently come to a mutual understanding in some form as to their respective shares. In fact, nothing more than this simple dualism is required to enable distribution study their laws embryonicly in their logical necessity. Cooperative working an equal footing is here just as conceivable as the combination of forces, the complete subjection of one party who is then compelled to render economic service as a slave as a mere between the state of equality and that of knowledge on the one part and of of omnipotence solely active participation on the other. There's a range of stages which the events of world history filled in in rich variety. A universal survey of the various justice and injustice throughout history is here an essential presupposition. Hello? And in conclusion, the whole question of distribution is transformed into a, quote, economic right of distribution, unquote. Now at last, hairdeering has firm ground under his feet again. Arm in arm with his 2 men, can issue his challenge to his age. But behind this trinity, stands yet another, an unnamed man, quote, capital has not invented surplus labor. Wherever a part of society possesses the material | 1415.4742139999998 | 1901.484837 |
| SPEAKER_2 | improvements of production, | 1901.484837 | 1902.704837 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the laborer free or not free, must add to the working time necessary for his own maintenance and extra working time order to produce the means of subsistence for the owners of the means production, whether this proprietor be the Athenian aristocrat, the Etruscan theocrat, CIVIS Romanus or Roman citizen, Norman Baron, American slave owner, Blauchaine Boyard, modern landlord or capitalist, unquote. That's quoting from Marx's Capital Volume 1. When hairdresser had thus learned what the basic form of exploitation to all forms of production up to the present day is. So far as these forms move in class antagonist, all he had to do was to apply his new men to it. The foundation of the economics of reality was completed. He did not hesitate for a moment to carry out this, quote, system creating idea. Labor without compensation. Beyond the labor time necessary for the maintenance of the vehicle itself that is the point. The atom who is here called Robinson Crusoe makes his 2nd Adam, | 1846.864212 | 1966.384837 |
| SPEAKER_2 | man Friday, for all he's worth. | 1966.384837 | 1968.654837 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But why does Friday toil more than is necessary for his own maintenance? To this question too, Mark's step by step provides an answer. But this answer is far too long winded for the 2 men. The matter is settled in a trice. Crusoe, quote, oppresses Friday. Compels him, quote, to render economic service as a slave or a tool. And maintains him, quote, also only as a tool. With these latest, quote, creative turns of his Hair dearing kills as it were 2 birds with one stone. Firstly, he saves himself the trouble of explaining the various foreign of distribution which have hitherto existed. Differences and their causes, taking the lump are simply of no account. They rest on oppression, On force, We shall have to deal with this before long. Secondly, thereby transfers the whole theory of distribution from this sphere of economics to the. That is from the sphere of established material facts to that of more or less vacillating opinions and sentiments. He therefore no longer has any need to investigate or to prove things He can go on to claiming that his heart's content and demand that the distribution of the products of labor should be regulated, not in accordance with its real causes, but in accordance with ethical ethics to him | 1912.994212 | 2045.844837 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Jerry? | 1990.284212 | 1990.624212 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But what seems just a hairdeering is not at all a mutable. Hence very far from being a genuine truth. For genuine truth, according to heredding himself, he | 1990.864212 | 2055.9248669999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | was | 2056.144837 | 2056.2248369999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | absolutely immutable. 18/68, her during asserted that it was a quote tendency of all higher civilization to put more and more emphasis on profit. And in this, not in confusion of rights and | 2056.2248369999998 | 2069.804877 |
| SPEAKER_2 | spheres of sovereignty, but in the essence and the future of modern development. Unquote. | 2069.804877 | 2018.5242119999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And furthermore, he was quite unable to see, quote, how a transformation of wage labor into another manner of gaining a livelihood is ever to be reconciled with the laws of human nature and the naturally necessary structure of the body social. Unquote. Thus, | 2018.9442119999999 | 2035.324212 |
| SPEAKER_2 | in 18/68, private property and | 2091.364837 | 2093.834837 |
| SPEAKER_1 | wage labor are naturally necessary and therefore just. In 18/76, both of these are the emanation of force and force robbery, and therefore, unjust. And as we cannot possibly tell what in a few years years' time may seem ethical and just to such a mighty andpetuous genius, we should, in any case, do better considering the distribution of wealth to the real objective economic laws and not to depend on the momentary, changeable, subjective conceptions of hairdressing as to what is just or unjust. If for the impending overthrow, the present mode of distribution of the products of labor, with its crying contrasts of want and luxury, starvation and surfeit, we had no better than the consciousness that the mode of distribution is unjust and that justice must eventually triumph should be in a pretty bad way. We might have a long time to wait. We do. Of the Middle Ages dreamed | 2038.094212 | 2147.894837 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Law of the conservation of energy. As the mere expression of the indestructibility, uncreatability of motion. That is merely in its quantitative aspect this narrow negative conception is being more and more supplanted by the positive idea of the transformation of energy in which for the first time, the qualitative content of the process comes into its own. And the last vestige of an extra mundane creator is obliterated. That the quantity of motion, so called energy, remains unaltered when it is transformed from kinetic energy so called mechanical force, into electricity, He potential energy, etcetera, and vice versa. No longer needs to be preached to something new. It serves as the already secured basis for the now much more pregnant investigation into the very process of transformation. The great basic process, knowledge of which comprises all knowledge of nature. And since biology has been pursued, in the light of the period of evolution, one rigid boundary line of class the has been swept weigh in the domain of organic nature. The almost unclassified | 0 | 69.44000000000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | organisms out of one class into a Other. Of faith, are losing their absolute validity. We now have mammals that lie eggs. And if the report is confirmed, also birds that walk on all fours. Years ago, Virchow was compelled following on the discovery of himself to dissolve the unity of the individual animal being, into a federation of cell states thus acting more progressively rather than scientifically and dialectically. And now the conception of animal therefore also human, individuality is becoming far more complex owing to the discovery of the white blood corpuscles which creep about amoeba life within the bodies of the higher animals. In is, however, precisely the polar antagonism put forward as your irreconcilable and insoluble. The forcibly fixed lines of demarcation and class distinctions which have given modern theoretical natural sciences restricted, metaphysical character. The recognition that these antagonisms and distinctions though to be found in nature, are only of relative validity. That on the other hand, their imagined rigidity and absolute validity have been introduced into nature only by our reflective minds. This recognition as the colonel of the dialectical conception in nature. It is possible to arrive at this because the accumulating facts of natural science compel us to do so. But one arrives at it more easily if one approaches the dialectical character of these facts, equipped with an understanding of the laws of dialectical thought. In any case, natural science has now advanced so far it can no longer escape dialectical generalization. However, it will make this process easier for Saul. If it does not lose sight of the fact that the results in which the experiences are summarized are concepts, that the art of working with concepts is not inborn, and is also not given with ordinary everyday consciousness. But requires real thought that this thought similarly has a long empirical history. Not more and not less than empirical natural science. Only by learning to assimilate the results of the development of philosophy during the past 2 and a half 1000 years? Will it rid itself on the one hand of any natural philosophy standing apart from it? Outside it, and above it. And on the other hand, also of its own limited method of thought, which is its inheritance from English empiricism. London, September 23rd, 18/85. Preface 3, 1894. The following new edition is a reprint of the performer, except for a few very unimportant stylistic changes. It is only in one chapter, the 10th of part 2. From Krisha Gashikta that I have allowed myself to make substantial additions on the following grounds. As already stated in the preface to the second edition, this chapter was in all essentials the work of Marx. I was forced to make considerable cuts in Marx's manuscript. Which in its first wording had been intended as an article for a journal. And to cut precisely those parts of it, in which the critic of Durer's proposition was over Marx's own revelation the history of economics. But this is just the section of the manuscript, which is even today of the greatest and most permanent interest. I consider myself under an obligation to give in as full and faithful a form as possible. Passages in which Marx assigns the people like Teddy, North Bloch, and Hume, their appropriate place the genesis of classical political economy. And even more, his explanation of Kwasnay's economic tableau. Which has remained an insoluble riddle of the Spinks. To all modern political economy. On the other hand, whoever the threat of the argument makes this possible, I've omitted which refer exclusively to hairdreings writing. For the rest, I may well be perfectly satisfied to the degree to which since the previous edition of the book was issued, the views maintained in it have penetrated into the social consciousness assigned Circle.

London, May 23rd. 18 94 at angles. Moving on now to the introduction. Part 1 of 2, General. Modern socialism is its essence, the direct product of the recognition on the one hand of the class antagonisms existing in the society of today between proprietors and nonproprietors. Between capitalists wage workers. On the other hand, of the anarchy existing in production, But in its theoretical form, modern socialism originally appears ostensibly as a more logical extension of the principle principles laid down by the great French philosophers of the 18th century, Like every new theory, modern socialism had, at first, to connect itself with the intellectual stock and trade, ready to attend. However, deeply its roots lay, economic facts. Mhmm. The great men who in France, prepared men's minds for the coming revolution or themselves extreme revolutionists. They recognized no external authority of any kind whatever. Religion, natural science, society, political institutions, everything was subjected to the most unsparing criticism. Everything must justify its existence before the judgment seat of reason or give up existence. Reason became the sole measure of everything. It was the time when the the world stood upon its head. 1st in the sense that the human head and the principles arrived at by its thought claim to be the basis of all human action and association. But by and by also in the wider sense. The reality which was in contradiction to these principles had in fact be turned upside down. Every form of society and government then existing. Every old traditional notion was flown into the lumber room as irrational. The world had hitherto allowed itself to be led solely by prejudices Everything in the past deserved only pity and contempt. Now, for the first time, appeared the light of day, henceforth superstition, Justice privilege, oppression, to be superseded by eternal truth. Eternal right, quality based on nature, and the inalienable rights of man. We know today that this kingdom of reason was nothing more than the Borglassi. That this eternal right found its realization in bourgeois justice. That this equality reduced itself to bourgeois equality before the law. That bourgeois property was proclaimed as one of the essential rights of man that the government of reason of Rousseau came into being and only could come into being as a democratic bourgeois republic. The great thinkers of the 18th century could know more than their predecessors. Go beyond the limits imposed upon them by their epoch. But side by side with the antagonism of the feudal nobility in the Burgundy was the general antagonism of exploiters and exploited of rich idlers and poor workers. It was this very circumstance that made it possible for the representatives of the board to put themselves forward as representing not one special class, but the whole of suffering humanity. Still further, from its origin, the bourgeoisie was saddled with its antithesis. Capitalists cannot exist without wage workers. And in the same proportion as the medieval burger of the guild developed into modern bourgeois. The guild journeyman, and the day length outside the guild developed into a proletariat. And although on the whole, the board love the in their struggle with the nobility, could claim to represent a | -0.1706220000000067 | 525.1899999999999 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Of society. If pure reason and justice have not hitherto ruled the world, this has been the case only because men have not rightly understood them. What was wanted was the individual man of genius. Who has now arisen who understands the truth. That he has now arisen that the truth has now been clearly understood is not an inevitable event. Following of necessity in the chain of historical development, a mere happy accident you might just as well have been born 500 years earlier. He might then have spared humanity 500 years of error strife and suffering. This mode of outlook is essentially that of all English and French and of the first German socialist. Including Beitwing. Socialism is the expression of absolute truth, reason and justice, and power. And as absolute truth, it's independent of time. Space, end of the historical development | 655.055185 | 712.075187 |

And as each one's special kind of absolute truth reason, and justice is again conditioned by their subjective understanding, their conditions of existence. The measure of their knowledge and their intellectual training, There is no other ending possible in this conflict of absolute truths. Then that they shall be mutually exclusive, one of the other. Ends From this, nothing could come a kind of eclectic average socialism which as a matter of fact has up to the present time dominated the minds of most of the socialist workers in France and England. Hence, mishmash allowing of the most manifold shades of opinion. A mishmash of less striking critical statements, economic theories, pictures of future society by the founders of different sects, A mishmash which is the more easily brewed, the more the definite sharp edges of the constituents, are rubbed down in the stream of debate like rounded pebbles in a brook. To make a science of socialism, had first to be placed upon a real basis. In the meantime, along with and after the French philosophy of the 18th century had arisen the new German philosophy. Culminating in Hegel. Its greatest merit was the taking up again of dialectics as the highest form of reasoning. The old Greek philosophy were all born natural dialecticians. And Aristotle most encyclopedic intellect of them, and already analyzed the most essential forms of dialectic Alright. The newer philosophy on the other hand although in it also dialectics had brilliant exponents, e. G. Descartes and Spinoza. Had, especially through English influence, become more and more rigidly fixed in the so called metaphysical mode of reasoning. By which also the French of the 18th century were almost wholly dominated at all events in their special philosophical work. Outside philosophy in the restricted sense, the French nevertheless produced masterpieces of dialectic. We need only call to mind Pieterose Le Novotre Ramot. And Rousseau's Discourse Sir L'origine Les fondement de We give here in brief the essential character of these two modes of thought. Shall have to return to them later in greater detail. We consider and reflect upon nature at large or the history of mankind, or our own intellectual activity, at first, we see the picture of an endless and of relations, and reaction, which nothing remains what where, and as it was. That everything moves. Changes comes into being passes away. Is primitive. Naive, but intrinsically correct conception of the world is that of ancient Greek philosophy. And it was first clearly formulated by Heraclitus. Everything is and is not where everything is fluid. It is constantly changing. Constantly coming into being, and passing away. But this conception correctly as it expresses the general character of the picture of appearances as a whole does not suffice to explain the details of which this picture is made up. And so long as we do not understand these, we have not a clear idea of the whole picture. In order to understand these details, must attach them from their natural or historical connection examine each one separately. Its nature, special causes, effects, etcetera. This is primarily the task of natural science historical research. Branches of science with the Greeks of classical times on very good grounds, relegated to a subordinate position. Because they had, first of all, to collect material The beginnings of the exact natural sciences were first worked out by the Greeks of the Alexandrian period. Later on in the middle ages by the Arabs. Real natural science dates from the first half of the 15th century and then Then onward, it is advanced with constantly increasing rapidity. The analysis of nature into its individual parts grouping of the different natural processes and objects indefinite classes, the study of the internal anatomy of organic bodies and their manifold forms, These were the fundamental conditions of the gigantic strides in our knowledge of nature. That have been made during the last 400 years. But this method of work has also left us as legacy The habit of observing natural objects and processes in isolation apart from their connection with the vast pole. Of observing them in repose not in motion, as constants not as essentially variables. In their death, not in their life. And when this way of looking at things was transferred by Bacon and Locke for natural science philosophy. It begot the narrow metaphysical mode of thought peculiar to the preceding centuries. To the metaphysician, things and their mental reflexes Ideas. Are isolated are to be considered one after the other and apart from each other. Are objects of investigation fixed rigid, given once for all. He thinks in absolutely irreconcilable antithesis. Quote, his communication is yay yay nay, or what soever is more than these cometh of evil. Quoting Matthew 537. For him, a thing either exists or does not exist. A thing cannot at the same time be itself in something else. Positive and negative absolutely exclude one another, cause and effect stand in a rigid antithesis one to the other. At first sight, this mode of thinking seems to us very luminous because it is out of so called sound common sense. Only sound common sense respectable fellow that he is, in the homely realm of his own four walls, has very wonderful adventures Directly, he ventures out into the wide world of research. And the metaphysical mode of thought, justifiable and even necessary as it is in a number of domains whose extent varies according to the nature of the particular object of investigation. Sooner or later reaches a limit beyond which it becomes one-sided Restricted. Abstract. Lost in insoluble contradictions. In the contemplation of individual things, it forgets the connection between them. In the contemplation of their existence, forgets the beginning and end of that existence. Of their repose it forgets their motion. It cannot see the wood for the trees. For everyday purposes, we know and can say e. G. Whether an animal is alive or not. And upon closer inquiry, we find that this is, in many cases, a very complex question. As the jurists know full well. They have cuddled their brains in vain to discover a rational limit beyond which the killing of the child and its mother's womb is murder. It is just as impossible to determine absolutely the moment of death Her physiology proves that death is not an instantaneous momentary phenomenon. The very protracted process, in like manner every organic being is every moment the same and not the same. Every moment, it assimilates matter supplied from without, and gets rid of other matter. Every moment, some cells of his body die. And others build themselves anew. Need longer or shorter time the matter of its body is completely renewed. And is replaced by other atoms of matter so that every organic being is always itself and yet something other than itself. Quick comment here. Reminds me of the Buddhist analogy of a flame on a candle. If you step back from it, it's a candle, and there's a flame at the end of the wick. That is of static as a concept. However, the flame from moment to moment Is constantly flickering and changing. Never the same twice. Further, we find upon closer investigation that the 2 poles of an And this is are as inseparable as they are opposed. And that despite all their opposition, they mutually interpenetrate. And we find in like manner that cause and effector conceptions which all and in their application to individual cases. But as soon as we consider the individual cases, in their general connection with the universe as a whole, they run into each other. And they become confounded when we contemplate that universal action and reaction. Which causes and effects are eternally changing places, so that what is effect here and now will be caused there and then. And vice versa. None of these processes and modes of thought enters into the framework of metaphysical reasoning. Dialectics on the other hand comprehends things and their representations. Ideas in their essential connection, concatenation, Motion origin and ending. Such processes as those mentioned above are therefore so many corroborations of own method of procedure. Nature is the proof of dialectics. It must be said for modern science that it has furnished this proof with very rich materials increasingly daily. And thus has shown that in the last resort, nature works dialectically and not metaphysically. But the naturalists who have learned to think dialectically are few and far between. This conflict of the results of discovery with preconceived modes of thinking explains the endless confusion now reigning in theoretical natural science. The despair of teachers as well as learners of authors, and readers alike. An exact representation of the universe, of its evolution, of the development of mankind and of the reflection of this evolution in the minds of men, can therefore only be obtained by the method of dialect. With constant regard to the innumerable actions and reactions Life and death? A progressive or retrogressive changes And in the spirit, the new German philosophy has worked Kant began his career by resolving the stable solar system of Newton, and its eternal duration. After the famous initial impulse had once been given into the result of a historic process. Formation of the sun, all the planets out of a rotating nebula mass. From this, he at the same time drew the conclusion that given this origin of the Solar system. Future death, followed out of necessity. His theory half a century later was established mathematically by Laplace, And half a century after that, spectroscope proved the existence in space of such masses of gas in various stages of condensation. This new German philosophy culminated in the Hegelian system. In this system, and herein is its great merit, For the first time, the whole world natural, historical, intellectual, is represented as a process. I e, as in constant motion, change, development, transformation, and the attempt is made to trace out the internal connection that makes it continue was old of all this movement and development. From this point of view, the history of mankind no longer appeared as a wild world of senseless deeds of violence. All equally condemnable at the judgment seat of mature philosophic reason. And which are best forgotten as quickly as possible. But as the process of the evolution of man himself. It's now the task of the intellect to follow the gradual march of this process through all its devious ways. And to trace out the inner wall running through all its apparently accidental phenomena. That Hagel did not solve the problem is here immaterial. His epic making spirit is that he propounded the problem This problem is one that no single individual will ever be able to solve. Although Hagel was, with San Simone, most encyclopedic mind of his time. Yet he was limited. First, by the necessarily limited extent of his own knowledge and second, the limited extent and depth of knowledge and conceptions of this age. To these limits, a third must be added. Hagel was an idealist. To him, the thoughts within his brain were not the more or less abstract pictures of actual Things and processes But conversely, things and their evolution were only the realized pictures of the, quote, idea capital letter I existing somewhere from eternity before the world was. This way of thinking turned everything upside down, completely reversed the actual connection of things in the world. Correctly and ingeniously as many individual groups of facts were grasped by Hegel Yes. For the reasons just given, there's much that is botched artificial, Labored a word, wrong in point of detail. The Hegelian system in itself was a colossal miscarriage. But it was also the last of its kind. It was suffering, in fact, from an internal and incurable contradiction. Upon the one head, its essential proposition was the conception that human history is a process of evolution. Which by its very nature cannot find its intellectual final term the discovery of any so called absolute truth. But on the other hand, it laid claim to being the very essence of this absolute truth. The system of natural and historical knowledge embracing everything, and final for all time, a contradiction to the fundamental laws of dialectical reasoning. This law, indeed, by no means excludes, but on the contrary, includes the idea. That the systematic knowledge of the external universe can make giant strides from age to age. The perception of the fundamental contradiction in German idealism led necessarily back to materialism. But not to Bene not to be simply metaphysical, exclusively mechanical materialism of the 18th century. In contrast to the naively revolutionary simple rejection of all previous history, Modern materialism sees in the latter the process of evolution of humanity. It being its task to discover the laws of motion thereof. With the French of the 18th century, And with Hagel, the conception obtained of nature as a whole moving in narrow circles and forever immutable. With its eternal celestial bodies as Newton and unalterable organic species as Laenius taught. Modern materialism embraces the more recent discoveries of natural science. According to which, nature also has its history in time. Celestial bodies like the organic species that under favorable conditions people then. Being born And even if nature as a whole must still be said to move in recurrent cycles, these cycles assume infinitely larger dimensions. In both cases, modern materialism is essentially dialectic. And no longer needs any philosophy standing above the other sciences. As soon as each special science is bound to make clear its position in the great totality of things, and of our knowledge of things, A special science dealing with this totality is superfluous. That which still survives independently of all earlier philosophy, is the science of thought and its laws. Formal logic, and dialectics. Everything else is subsumed the positive science of nature and history. Whilst, however, a revolution in the conception of nature could only be made in proportion to the corresponding positive materials furnished by research. Already much earlier, certain historical facts had occurred led to a decisive change the conception of history. In 18/31, the first working class rising took place in Lyon. Between 18/38 and 18/42, the first national working class movement out of the English Chartists reached its height The class struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie came to the front in the history of the most advanced countries in Europe. In proportion to development on the one hand of modern industry, on the other of the newly acquired political supremacy of the bourgeoisie. Facts more and more strenuously gave the lie to the teachings of bourgeois economy as to the identity of the interests of capital and labor, as to the universal harmony and universal prosperity that would be the consequence of unbridled competition. All these things could no longer be ignored anymore than the French and English socialism which was their theoretical so very imperfect, expression. But the old idealist conception of history which was not yet dislodged, knew nothing of class struggles based upon economic interests. Knew nothing of economic interests. Production, and all economic relations appeared in it only as incidental. Subordinate elements in the, quote, history of civilization. The new facts made imperative a new examination of all past history. Then it was seen that all past history was the history of class struggles. That these warring classes of society are always the product production and of exchange. In a word, of the economic conditions of their time. That the economic structure of society always furnishes the real basis starting from which we can alone work out the ultimate explanation of the whole superstructure. Juridical and political institutions, as well as of the religious, philosophical, and other ideas of a given historical period. But now idealism was driven from its last refuge. Philosophy of history. And now a materialistic treatment of history was propounded. And a method found of explaining people's knowing by our being. Instead of as heretofore our being by our knowing. But the socialism of earlier days was as materialistic conception as the conception of nature of the French materialist was with dialects. And modern natural science. The socialism of earlier days certainly criticized the existing capitalistic motive its consequences. But it could not explain them. And therefore could not get the mastery of them. It could only simply reject them as bad. Before this, it was necessary, 1, to present the capitalistic method of production its historical connection its inevitableness during a particular historical period, and therefore also to present its inevitable downfall. And 2, to lay bare its essential character, which was still a secret as its critics had hitherto attacked its evil consequences rather than the process of the thing itself. This was done by the discovery of surplus value. It was shown that the appropriation of unpaid labor is the basis of the capitalist mode of production. Of the exploitation of the worker that occurs under it. That even if the capital has buys the labor power of his laborer at its full value as a commodity on the market, he yet extracts more value from it than he paid for. And that in the ultimate analysis, this surplus value forms those sums of value from which are heaped up at constantly increasing masses of capital. In the hands of the possessing classes. The genesis of capitalist production the production of capital were both explained. These two great discoveries the materialistic conception of history and the revelation of the secret of capitalistic production through surplus value we owe to Marx, With these discoveries, socialism became a science. The next thing was to work out all its details and relations. This approximately was how things stood in the fields of theoretical socialism and extinct philosophy. When Her Eugen Durgin not without considerable din, sprang onto the stage and announced that he had accomplished a complete revolution in philosophy political economy, Let us see. What hairdrying promises how he fulfills his promises. Now beginning part 2 of the introduction, what hairduring promises. The writings of hairdurin, which we are here primarily concerned, are his courses there philosophy It is critic, Geschichte, their nazioeconomy, one day is autonomous. The first named work is the one which particularly claims our attention here. On the very first page, hereduring introduces himself as, quote, the man who claims to represent this power velocity, in his age and for its immediately foreseeable development, unquote. He does proclaims himself to be the only true philosopher of today. And of the foreseeable future. Whoever departs from him departs from truth. Many people, even before hairdrying, thought something was kind about themselves, but except for Richard Wagner, he is probably the first who has calmly blurted it out. And the truth to which he refers is, quote, a final and ultimate truth. Herduring's philosophy is quote, natural system, or the philosophy of reality. In it, reality is so conceived as to exclude any tendency to a visionary subjectively limited conception of the world Unquote. This philosophy is therefore of such a nature that it lifts her during above The limits he himself can hardly deny personal subjective limitations. And this is in fact necessary if he is to be in a position to lay down final and ultimate truths Although so far, we do not see how this miracle should come to pass. Quote, this natural system, which in itself is a value to the mind, has without the slightest attraction from the profundity of thought, securely establish the basic forms of being. From its really critical standpoint, it provides the elements of a philosophy which is Real and therefore directed to the reality of nature and life. A philosophy which cannot allow the validity of any merely apparent horizon but in its powerfully revolutionizing movement, unfolds all earths and heavens of outer and inner nature. It is a new mode of thought Its results are from the ground up original conclusions and views. System creating ideas. Establish truths, And if we have before us, quote, a work which must find its strength in concentrated initiative whatever that may mean, quote initiative going to the roots of deep rooted science a strictly scientific conception of things and people. An all around penetrating work of thought, a creative evolving of premises and conclusions controllable My thought. The absolutely fundamental unquote, Comment, during maybe should have gone into advertising, It In the economic and political sphere, he gives us not only, quote, historical and systematically comprehensive works, unquote, of which the historical ones are to boot, notable for, quote, my historical depiction in the grand style. While those dealing with political economy, brought about, quote, creative turns. But he even finishes with a fully worked out socialist plan of his own for the plan which is the quote, practical fruit of a clear theory going to the ultimate roots of things. Unquote. And like the during philosophy, is consequently infallible. And offers the only way to salvation. Forequote. Only in that socialist structure which I have sketched. In my Courses Terre Nasionale Sociol Economy, can a true own take the place of ownership, which is merely apparent and transitory? Even based on violence on 2, And the future has to follow these directions. This bouquet of glorifications of hairduring by hairduring could easily be enlarged, tenfold. It may already have created some doubt in the mind the reader as to whether it is really a philosopher with whom he is dealing Or a hope we must beg the reader to reserve judgment until he has got to know the above mentioned, quote, deep rootedness at closer quarters. We have given the above anthology only for the purpose of showing that we have before us not any ordinary philosopher, socialist, merely expresses his ideas and leaves it to the future to judge their worth. But quite an extraordinary creature. Who claims to be not less infallible than the pope and whose doctrine is the only way to salvation and simply must be accepted by anyone who does not want the Paul, into the most abominable heresy. What we are here confronted with is certainly not one of those works in which all socials literature, recently also German, bounded? Works in which people of various calibers in the most straightforward way in the world try to clear up in their minds problems for the solution of which they may be more or less short of material. Works in which, whatever their scientific and literary shortcomings, socialist goodwill is always deserving of recognition. On the contrary, hairdressing offers us principles which he declares are final. And ultimate truths. And therefore, any views conflicting with these are false from the outset. He is in possession not only of the exclusive truth, but also the sole strictly scientific method of investigation. In contrast with which all others are unscientific. Either he is right and in this case, we have before us the greatest genius of all time, the first superhuman he calls infallible person. Or he is wrong And in that case, whatever our judgment may be, benevolent consideration shown for any good intentions he may possibly have had nevertheless be the most deadly insult to her during. When a man is in possession of the final and ultimate truth and of the only strictly scientific method, It is only natural that should have a certain contempt for the rest of airing and unscientific humanity. We must therefore not be surprised that Harry Dearing should speak of his predecessors with extreme disdain. That there are only a few great men. Thus styled by way of exception by himself, who find mercy at the bar of his, quote, Keep ridding this. Us hear first what he has to say about the philosophers. Quote, Leibnitz devoid of any nobler sentiments, that best of all court philosophers Unquote. Can't is still just about tolerated, but after him, everything got into a muddle. There followed the, quote, wild ravings and equally child ish and windy stupidities of the immediately succeeding epagoni. Namely a ficta, And it's showing monstrous caricatures of ignorant natural philosophizing. The post Kantian monstrosities and the, quote, delirious fantasies crowned by, quote, Hey, Hagel. Unquote. The last name used a, quote, haggle jargon. And spread the, quote, hagel pestilence. By means of his, quote, moreover, even inform, unscientific demeanor. And his quote prudities. The natural scientists fair no better but as only Darwin is cited by name, we must confine ourselves him. With their coarsely sentient narrowness and comprehension and blunted power of differentiation, In our view, what is specific to Darwinism from which, of course, the Lamarckian formulations must be excluded is a piece of brutality directed against humanity. But the socialists come off worst of all. With the exception at any rate of Li Blung. The most insignificant of them all, they are all in sundry centers fall short of the reputation which they should have before or behind or during. And not only in regard to truth and scientific method, no, also in regard to their character. Except for Bebop and a few communards of 18/71, none of them are, quote, men. The 3 utopians are called, quote, social alchemists, as to them certain indulgence is shown to Saint Simon, insofar as he had merely charged Quote. Exaltation of mind. And there is a compassionate suggestion that he suffered from religious mania. With Fourier, however, hairdrying completely loses patients. Before he a quote, revealed every element of insanity. Ideas which one would normally have most expected to find in Madhouse the wildest dreams, products of delirium, the, quote, unspeakably silly Fourier. This, quote, infantile mind This quote idiot. Is with all not even a socialist. Is it lancery is absolutely not a piece of Rational Socialism. But, quote, a caricature constructed on the pattern of everyday commerce. And finally, quote, anyone who does not find effusions of Fourier's concerning Newton, sufficient to convince himself that in Fourier's name, and in the whole of Fourierism, only the first syllable Crazy. That has any truth in it. Should himself be classified under some category of idiots. Unquote. Finally, Robert Owen, quote, had feeble and paltry ideas his reasoning, so crude in ethics, A few common places would degenerate it into perversions. Nonsensical and crude way of looking at things. The course of Owen's ideas is hardly worth subjecting to more serious criticism. His vanity. Unquote, and so on. With extreme wit, Herdurin characterizes the utopians by reference to their names as San Simone, Sam, Holy Create oh, crazy. On Fontaine. On fondant, on fondant, childish, He only needs to add Owen. Oh, woah. And a very important period in the history of socialism has in four words been roundly condemned. And anyone who has any doubts about it, quote, should himself be classed under some category of idiots. As for during his opinion of the later socialists, we shall, for the sake of brevity, cite them only on the solemn marks. The sal, quote, Adantic. Hair splitting efforts to popularize rampant scholasticism a monstrous hash of general theories and paltry trash, Haigle superstition, senseless and formless, a horrifying example, peculiarly limited pompous display of the most paltry trifles. Our Jewish hero Hamletier Common inherent instability in his view of life and of the world. In series of books. Marx Well, narrowness of conception his works and achievements in and by themselves, that is regarded from a purely theoretical standpoint are without any permanent significant in our domain, critical history of socialism, quote, and in the general history of intellectual tendencies, they are to be cited at most as symptoms of the influence of 1 branch of modern sectarian scholastics, evidence of the faculties of concentration and undignified affectation of language, anglicized vanity, Dupee. Parent conceptions, which in fact are only bastard of historical and logical fantasy, deceptive twisting, personal vanity, vile mannerisms, Snotty. A flonary pretending to be witty, Chinese erudition. Philosophical and scientific backward. Ness, unquote. And so on and so forth. But this is only a small, superficially cold bouquet out of the during rose garden. It must be understood that at the moment, we are not in the least concerned whether amiable expressions of abuse which if he had any education, should forbid hairdurrying from finding anything violent, naughty, are also final and ultimate truths. And for the moment, we will guard against voicing any doubt as to their deep rootedness. As we might otherwise be prohibited even from trying to find the category of idiots to which we belong. We only thought it was our duty to give on the one hand, an example of what hairdurrings calls, quote, the select language of the considerate, and in the real sense of the word, moderate mode of expression, unquote. And on the other hand, to make it clear that the hairdurings the worthlessness of his predecessors, is a no less established fact than his own infallibility. Whereupon we sink to the ground in deepest reverence before the mightiest genius of all time, if that is how things really stand. So that's the end of the introduction. Also counted as chapters 1 and 2. Now formally beginning part 1 philosophy chapter 3, classification. A priorism. We begin with a passage which summarizes and quotes during philosophy. According to Harry Dearing, is the development of the highest form of consciousness of the world and of life, and in a wider sense, embraces the principles of all knowledge and volition. Wherever a series of cognitions or stimuli or group of forms of being come to be examined by human consciousness. The principles underlying these manifestations of necessity become an object of philosophy. These principles are the simple, or until now assumed to be simple constituents of manifold knowledge and volition, like the chemical composition of bodies, the general constitution of things, can be reduced to basic forms and basic elements. These ultimate constituents or principles once they have been discovered, are valid not only for what is immediately known and accessible, but also for the world which is unknown the inaccess to us. Philosophical principles consequently provide the final supplement for in order to become uniform system, by which nature and human life can be explained. Apart from the fundamental forms of all existence, philosophy has only 2 specific groups of investigation. Nature and the world of man Accordingly, our material arranges itself quite naturally into 3 groups. Namely, general scheme of the universe, the science of the principles of nature, and finally, the science of mankind. This succession at the same time contains an interlogical sequence for the formal principles which are valid for all being take precedence. In the realms of the objects to which they are to be applied, then follow in the degree of their subordination. That ends the long quoting and paraphrasing section. So far, Air Durning. And almost entirely word for word. What he is dealing with are therefore principles. Formal tenets derived from thought, and not from the external world. Which are to be applied to nature in the realm of people and to which, therefore, and people have to conform. What when's does thought obtain these principles? From itself No. For hairdurrying himself says the realm of pure thought is limited to logical schemata. And mathematical forms. The latter, moreover, as we shall see, is wrong. Logical schemata can only relate to forms of thought. But what we are dealing with here is solely forms of being. Of the external world. These forms can never be created, and derived by thought out of itself. But only from the external world. But with this, the whole relationship is inverted. The principles are not the starting point of the investigation. But its final result They're not applied to nature and human history, but abstracted from them It is not nature in the realm of man which conform to these principles. But the principles are only valid insofar as they're in conformity with nature and history. That is the only materialist conception of the matter. And Herdurings' contrary conception is idealistic. Makes things stand completely on their heads, and fashions the real world out of ideas out of schemata, schemes or categories existing somewhere before the world from eternity, just like a Hagel. In fact, let us compare Hagel's encyclopedia and all its delirious fantasies with Harry Dearing's final and ultimate truths. With hairduring, we have in the 1st place general world schematism cable calls, Logic. Then with both of them, we have the application of these or logical categories to nature. The philosophy of nature, and finally, their application to the realm of man. Which Hegel calls the philosophy of mind. The inner logical sequence of the during succession therefore leads us quote, quite naturally Back to Hegel's encyclopedia, from which it has been taken with a loyalty which would move that wandering Jew the Egellian school professor Michelet of Berlin to tears. That is what comes of accepting consciousness. Thought, quite naturalistically. Something given something opposed from the outset to being. Nature. If that were so, it must seem extremely strange that consciousness and nature thinking and being, the laws of thought, and the laws of nature, should correspond so closely But if the further question is raised what thought and consciousness really are, where they come from. It becomes apparent that they are products of the human brain. And that man himself is a product of nature. Which has developed in and along with its environment. Hence, it is self evident that the products of the human brain being in the last analysis also products of nature. Do not contradict the rest of nature's interconnections but are in correspondence with them. But her during cannot permit himself such a simple treatment of the subject. He thinks not only in the name of humanity, in itself no small achievement, but in the name of the conscious and reasoning beings on all celestial bodies, Indeed, it would be, quote, a degradation of the basic forms of consciousness and knowledge to attempt to rule out or even to put under suspicion their sovereign validity and their unconditional claim to truth By applying the epithet human to them. Unquote. Hence, in order that no suspicion may arise that on some celestial body or other, twice 2 makes 5. Her during dare not designate thought as being human. And so he has to sever it from the only real foundation on which we find it. Namely, man and nature. And with that, he tumbles hopelessly into an ideology which reveals him as the opyony of the, quote, opyony Hegel. By the way, we shall often meet her during again. On other celestial bodies. It goes without saying that no materialist doctrine can be found on such an ideological basis. Later on, we shall see that hairdrying is forced more than once. To endow nature surreptitiously with conscious activity. With what in plain language is called God. However, our philosopher of reality had also other motives for shifting the basis of all reality from the real world to the world of thought. The science of this general world schematism of these formal principles of being, is precisely the foundation of hairdressing's philosophy. If we deduce world schematism not from our minds, but only through our minds from Real world. If we deduce principles of being from what is, we need no philosophy for this purpose. The positive knowledge of the world and of what happens in it And what this yields is also not philosophy, positive science. In that case, however, herdern's whole volume would be nothing but love's labor lost. Further, if no philosophy as such is any longer required, then also there is no more need of any system. Not even of any natural system of philosophy. The perception that all the processes of nature are systematically connected drives science on to prove this systematic connection throughout. Both in general and in particular. Put an adequate exhaustive scientific exposition of this interconnection the formation of an exact mental image of the world system in which we live, is impossible for us and will always remain impossible. If at any time in the development of mankind, such a final conclusive system of the interconnections within the world physical as well as mental and historical, were brought about this would mean that human knowledge had reached Women. And from the moment when society had been brought into accord with that system, further historical development would be cut short. Which would be an absurd idea. Sheer nonsense. Mankind, therefore, finds itself faced with a contradiction. The one hand, it has to gain an exhaustive knowledge of the world system you know, all its interrelations, and on the other hand, because of the nature both of men and of the world system, this task can never be completely fulfilled. But this contradiction lies not only in the nature of the two factors, and man also the main lever of all intellectual advance. And finds its solution continuously day by day, in the endless progressive development of humanity, Just as, for example, mathematical problems find their solution in an infinite series or continued fractions. Each mental image of the world system is and remains an actual fact limited objectively by the historical conditions and subjectively, by the physical and mental constitution of its originator. But her during explains in advance that his reasoning is such that it excludes any tendency to a subjectively limited conception of the | 655.1445580000001 | 3191.185085 |

As with the basic forms of being, so also with the whole of pure math or during things that he can produce it, a priority. That is without making use of the experience offered us by the external world. And construct it in his head. In pure mathematics, the mind deals quote, with its own free creations and imaginations. The concepts of number and figure are quote the adequate object of that pure science which it can create of itself. And hence, it has a, quote, validity, which is independent of particular experience ended the real content of the world. Unquote. That pure mathematics has a validity which is independent of the particular experience of each individual. Is for that matter correct. And this is true of all established facts in every science. And indeed of all facts whatsoever. The magnetic poles, the fact that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, the fact that Hagel is dead or during alive, hold good independently of my own experience or that of any other individual. And even independently of her during his experience. When he begins to sleep, the sleep of the just But it is not at all true that in pure mathematics, the mind deals only with its own creations and imaginations. The concepts of number and figure have not been derived from any source other than the world of reality. The 10 fingers on which we learned to count that is to perform the first arithmetical operation, are anything but a pre creation of the mind. Counting requires not only objects that can be counted, but also the ability to exclude all properties of the object considered except their number. And this ability is the product of a long historical development based on Experience. Like the idea of number, so the idea of figure is borrowed exclusively from the external world. It does not arise in the mind out of pure thought. There must have been things which had shaped and whose shapes were compared before anyone could arrive at the idea of figure. Pure mathematics deals with the space forms and quantity relations of the real 9. That is material which is very real indeed. The fact that this material appears in an extremely abstract form can only superficially conceal its origin from the external world. But in order to make it possible to investigate these forms and relations, in their pure state, is necessary to separate them entirely from their content. To put the content aside as irrelevant. Thus, we get points without dimensions, lines without breadth and thickness, a and b and x and y, constants and variables, and only at the very end we reach the free creations and imaginations of the mind itself. That is the Say imaginary magnitudes. Even the apparent derivation of mathematical magnitudes from each other does not prove their a priori origin. But only their rational connection. Before one came upon the idea of deducing the form of the cylinder from the rotation of a rectangle out one of its sides a number of real rectangles and cylinders however imperfect in form, must have been examined. Like all other sciences, mathematics arose out of the needs of people from the measurement of land and the content of vessels and the computation of time for mechanics. But as in every department of thought, at a certain stage of development, the laws which were abstracted from the real world become divorced from the real world. And are set up against it as something independent. As laws coming from outside. To which the world has to conform, That is how things happened in society and in the state. And in this way, otherwise pure mathematics was subsequently applied to the world. Although it is borrowed from the same world. It represents only one part its forms of interconnection. And it's only just because of this that it can be applied at all. But just as hairdressing imagines that, out of the axioms of mathematics, quote, which also in accordance with pure logic, neither Unplug. He can deduce the whole of pure mathematics without any kind of empirical admixture. And then apply it to the world So he likewise imagined that he can in the first place. Produce out of his head the basic forms of being. The simple elements of all knowledge, the axioms of velocity, To deduce from these the whole of philosophy or world schematism. And then by sovereign decree, impose this constitution of his on nature and humanity. Unfortunately, nature is not at all. In humanity only to an infinitesimal degree. Composed of the mantopelite Prussians of 18 50. Mathematical axioms are expressions of the scantiest thought content. Which mathematics is obliged to borrow from logic. They can be reduced to 2, 1, The whole is greater than its part. This statement is pure tautology. As the quantitatively conceived idea Hard. Is from the outset definitely related to the idea and in fact, in such a way that part simply means that the quantitative whole consists of several quantitative parts. In stating this explicitly, the so called axiom does not take us a step further. This tautology can even in a way be proved by saying, a whole is that which consists of several parts, A part is that of which several make a whole. Hence, the part is less than the whole. In which the inanity of repetition brings out even more clearly the inanity of content. 2, if 2 quantities are equal to a third, they're equal to each other. This statement, as Hagel has already shown, is a conclusion, the correctness of which is vouched for by logic. And which is therefore approved although outside of pure mathematics. The remaining axioms relating to equality and inequality are merely logical extensions of this conclusion. These major principles do not cut much ice. Either in mathematics or anywhere else. In order to get any further, we're obliged to bring in real relations relations in space forms, which are taken from real bodies. The ideas of lines, Plains. Angles, polygons, Spheres. Are all taken from reality. And it requires a pretty good portion of naive ideology. To believe the mathematicians that the first line came into existence through the movement of a point in space. The first plane is the movement of a line. The first solid through the movement of the plane. So on. Even language rebels against such a conception. Mathematical figure of 3 dimensions is called a solid body. Corpus solidum. Hence in Latin, even a tangible object. It therefore has a name derived from sturdy reality. And by no means from the pre imagination of the mind. But why all this prolixity? After hairduring on pages 42 43, has an enthusiastically sung the independence of pure mathematics from the world of experience. It's a priority. It's preoccupation with the mind's own free creations and imaginations. He says on page 63, quote, it is, of course, easily overlooked that those mathematical elements number, magnitude, time, space, and geometric motion. Are ideal only in their form. Absolute magnitudes are therefore something completely empirical no matter to what species they belong. Are capable of characterization which is adequate even though divorced from experience. Unquote. The last statement is more or less true of every abstraction. But does not by any means prove that it is not abstracted from reality. In world schematism, pure mathematics arose out of pure thought. In the philosophy of nature, it is something completely empirical. Taken from the external world and then divorced from it. Which are we to believe? Chapter 4, world schematism. Well, All embracing Dean is 1. In its self sufficiency. It has nothing alongside it To associate a second being with it, would be to make it something that it is not. Namely a part or constituent of a more comprehensive whole. Due to the fact that we extend our unified thought like a framework. Nothing that should be comprised in this thought unity can retain a duality within itself. Nor again can anything escape this thought unity. The essence of all thought consists in bringing together the elements of consciousness into a unity. It is the point of unity of the synthesis where the indivisible idea of the world came to being and the universe. As the name itself implies, is apprehended as something in which everything is tied into unity. Thus far, They're during. This is the first application of the mathematical method 1, every question is to be decided axiomaticly in accordance with simple basic forms. If we were dealing with the simple principles of mathematics. All embracing being is one. If tautology, simple repetition in the predicate of what is already expressed in the subject, If that makes an axiom, then we have here one of the purest water. Herdurin tells us in the subject that being embraces everything. And the predicate he intrepidly declares that in that case, there is nothing outside it. What colossal, quote, system creating thought This is indeed system creating. Within the space of the next six lines, Herdring has transformed the oneness of being. By means of our unified thought, into its unit. As the essence of all thought consists in bringing things together into a unity, so being, as soon as it is conceived, is conceived as unified. And the idea of the world as indivisible And because conceived being the idea of the world, is unified therefore, real being. The real world, is also an indivisible unity. And with that, quote, there's no longer any room for things beyond. Once the mind has learned to conceive being in its homogeneous universality. That is a campaign which puts Osterlitz and Jena Kooningretz, and Sedan completely in the shade. In a few sentences, hardly a page after we have mobilized the first axiom, We've already done away with cast overboard, destroyed, everything beyond the world god and the heavenly hosts, heaven, hell, and purgatory, along with the immortality of the soul. How do we get from the oneness of being to its unity? By the very fact of conceiving it. Insuffaras we spread our unified thought around being like a frame, its oneness becomes a unity of thought. Thought unity. For the essence of all thought consists in bringing together the elements of consciousness into a unity This last statement is simply untrue. In the first place, thought consists just as much in the taking apart of objective consciousness into their elements as in the putting together of related elements into a unity. Without analysis, no synthesis. Secondly, without making blunders, thought can bring together into a unit only those elements of consciousness in which or in whose real prototypes this unity already existed before. If I include a shoebush in the unity mammals, this does not help it to get memory glands. Unity of being, or rather question whether its conception as a unity is justified. Is therefore precisely what has to be proved. When heardering assures us that he can see being as a unity. Not as twofold. Tells us nothing more than his own unauthoritative opinion. If we try to state his process of thought in phonewide form, We get falling. I begin with Dean. I, therefore, think what being is. The thought of being is a unified thought. But thinking and being must be in agreement. They're in conformity with each other. They coincide. Therefore, being in unity also in reality. Therefore, there cannot be anything close beyond. If there are during had spoken without the size in its way to the treating us to the above oracular of happiness, his ideology would have been clearly visible. To attempt to prove the reality of any product is bought by the identity of thinking was indeed one of the most absurd delirious fantasies of a Haagen. Even if his whole method of proof had been correct, enduring still would not have won an inch of ground from the spiritual. The division into this world and the world beyond exists only for our specifically earthly, original sin standpoint. In and for itself, That is In John, All being is a unity. They would accompany Herdurian to his other beloved celestial bodies and show him one or several on which there had been no original sin. Where, therefore, no opposition exists between this world and the beyond. Where the unity of the universe is a dogma of faith. The most comical part of the business is that hair during in order to prove the nonexistent cause from the idea of being, uses the ontological for these when we think of god, we conceive him as the sum total of all perfection. But the sum total of all perfection includes above all A non existent being is necessarily imperfect. We must therefore include existence among the perfections of God. Hence, God must exist. They're doing reasons in exactly the same way. When we think of being, we conceive it as one idea. Whatever is comprised in one idea is a unity. Being would not correspond to the idea of being, if it were not a unity. Consequently, It must be Consequently, there is no god and shalom. When we speak of being, and purely of being, Unity can only consist in that all the objects for which we are referring, are, that is they exist. They're comprised in the unity of and in no other unit. And the general victims that they all are not only cannot give them any additional either common or not, but provisionally excludes all such qualities from consideration. For as soon | 3135.8545599999998 | 4095.585185 |
| SPEAKER_0 | First b before it can be 1. Being indeed is always an open question beyond the point where a sphere of observation ends. The real unity of the world its materiality. It's proved not by a few juggled phrases, but by a long and weary some development of philosophy and natural science, To return to the text, the being which hairdrying is telling us about is quote, not that pure self equal being, which lacks all special determinants. | 4083.9149479999996 | 4113.694948 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And after these have been dealt, we proceed, quote, in opposition to genus spans the concept of magnitude. As of a homogeneity in which no further differences of species exist, unquote. And so from quality, we've passed the quantity. And this is always quote, measurable. Let us now compare this, quote, sharp division of the general of Max Skamana and his, quote, really critical standpoint with the crunities while raving and delirious fantasies of a habil. We find that Hagel's objects starts from being as with our during. That being turned out to be nothing besides the perjuring. Now from this being nothing, there is a transition. It's also | 4182.0764798 | 4224.8164799999995 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Accustomed to help each other out. In special subjects. With the exception of 1 chapter, present new edition is an unaltered reprint of the former edition. For one thing, I had no time for a thoroughgoing revision. Though there was much in the presentation that I should have liked to alter. Besides, I'm under the obligation to prepare for the press. The manuscript which Marks has left, and this is much more important than anything else. Then again, my conscience rebels against making any offer alterations. The book is a polemic, and I think that I owe it to my adversary not to improve anything in my work when he is unable to improve his. I could only read will not read unless there's some special reason to do so. One pair during has written concerning my attack. To point of theory, I have finished with them. Besides, I must have | 0 | 58.18 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of the despicable injustice that has been done to him by the University of Berlin. It is true that the it is true that the university has not gone unpunished University which so abases itself as to deprive her during the circumstances which are well known in his academic freedom must not be surprised, to find their spending reports on ach in certain The only chapter in which I have allowed myself some additional elucidation is the second of part 3, theoretical. This chapter deals simply and solely with the exposition of a pivotal point the mode of outlook for which I stand. My adversary cannot therefore complain if I attempt to state it in a more popular form and to make it more coherent. And there was in fact an extraneous reason for doing this. I had revised 3 chapters and second of part 3. My friend, Lopard, with a view to their translation of French and publication with separate pamphlets. And after the French edition has served as basis for the Italian and Polish editions, a German edition was issued by Munich under the title the Wiklung Russian and Danish translations. In all these additions, it was only the chapter in question which had been amplified. It would have been pedantic in the new edition of the original work, to have tied myself down to its original text instead of later text, which had become known internationally. Whatever else I should have liked to alter relates in the main to 2 points. 1st, to the history of primitive society, the key to which was provided by Morgan only in 18/77. But as I have since then had the opportunity in my work or to to work up the material which in the meantime had become available to me. A reference to this later work meets the case. The second point concerns the section dealing with theoretical natural science. There's much that is clumsy in my exposition, and much of it could be expressed today in a clearer and more definite form. I have not allowed myself the right to improve this section. And for that very reason, am under an obligation to criticize myself here instead. Marx and I were pretty well the only people to rescue apply it in the materialist conception of history. The knowledge of mathematics and natural science is essential to a conception of nature with the dialectical and at the same time materialist. Marx was well versed in mathematics, but we can keep up with natural science only people meal. Intermittently and sporadically. This reason, when I retired from business and transferred my home to London, thus enabling myself to give the necessary to a multi, as Lebig calls it, in mathematics and the natural sciences and spends the best part of 8 years on it. I was right in the middle of this molting process when it happened that I had to occupy myself natural that in dealing with the subject, I was sometimes unable to find correct technical expression and in general mood with considerable clumsiness in the field of theoretical natural science. On the other hand, my lack of assurance in this field I had not yet overcome, made me cautious and I cannot be charged with real blunders in relation to the facts known that time or with incorrect presentation of recognized theories. In this connection, there was only 1 unrecognized genius of the magic who complained in a letter to Marx that I had made a wanton attack upon the honor of the square root. Of minus 1. It goes without saying that my recapitulation of match match the natural sciences was undertaken in order to convince myself also in detail of what in general I was not endowed | -0.2106250000000034 | 293.57 |

| SPEAKER_1 | 3 sections of the pamphlet, Engels explains the 3 components of Marxist thought, French socialism, German philosophy, and English economics. In the first part of the pamphlet, Engels explains that socialism of the past had been utopian, holding the belief that as soon as everyone in society understood socialism and believed that a socialist society would appear. Engels wrote, quote, the utopians attempted to evolve out of the human So Society presented nothing but | -0.19062495231628418 | 86.18000004768372 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Whose names are on the screen. So let's get into the audiobook. So again, this is Friedrich Engels, Socialism, Utopian, and Scientific. It was written between January March of 18/80. The source is Marx Engels' Selected Works Volume 3, page 95 to 151, published by Progress Publishers 1970. First published March, April, and May issues of Review Socialiste in 18 80 translated from the French by Paul Lafarge in 18/92, authorizes by Engels. And we are reading a copy from marxist.org Credit to them. And please go check out marxist.org. They have many such texts up on their site. Okay. The introduction. Among the best explanations of Marxism made by Marx in Engels, Engels wrote this pamphlet from portions of anti Durham, with the intention of | 0 | 56.16 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yes? To remove these was the | 86.42000007629395 | 88.94249507629395 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Hi. It was necessary that we discover a new and more perfect system of social order and to oppose this upon society without by propaganda, and wherever it was possible by the example of model experiments. Engels then explains the slow historical development of the dialectical philosophy over 1000 of years, knowledge that culminated into what allowed Marx to see and explain the materialist conception of history, which Engels goes on to explain in the third part of the pamphlet. Engels wrote about the publication of the pamphlet, quote, at the request of my friend, Paul Lafard, now representative of Lille and the French Chamber of Deputies, I arranged 3 chapters of this book as a pamphlet, which he translated and published in 18/80 under the title Socialism etopique et Socialism et Societe. From this French text, a Polish and a Spanish edition were prepared. In 18/83, our German friend brought out the pamphlet in the original language. Italian, Russian, Danish, Dutch, and Romanian translation based upon the German text have since been published. Thus, the present English edition, this little book circulate in 10 languages. I am not aware that any other socialist work not even our communist manifesto of 1848, or Marx's capital has so often been translated. In Germany, it has had 4 editions of almost 20,000 copies in all. 18/92 English edition introduction. General introduction in the history of materialism. The present book is originally part of a larger whole. About 18/75, doctor e During Pravit dosing university lecturer who formerly received fees from students rather than a wage. At Berlin University, suddenly and rather clamorously announced his conversion to socialism. And presented the German public not only with an elaborate socialist theory, but also with the complete practical plan from the the reorganization of society. As a matter of course, he fell foul of his predecessors. Above all, he honored marks by pouring out upon him the full vials of his wrath. This took place about the same time when the the 2 sections of the socialist party in Germany, Eisenacher's and Lasallians, had just affected their fusion at the Agatha Unification Congress and thus obtained not only an immense increase of strength, But what was more, the faculty of employing the whole of this strength against the common me The Socialist Party in Germany was fast becoming a power. But to make it a power, the first condition was that the newly unity should not be imperiled. And doctor Duran openly proceeded to form around himself a sect, nucleus of a future separate party. It thus became necessary to take up the gauntlet thrown down to us and to fight out the struggle whether we liked it or not. This, however, though it might not be an over difficult, was evidently a long winded business. As is well known, we Germans are the terribly ponderous gruntlickite radical profundity or profound radicality, whatever you wish to call it. Whenever any one of us expounds what he considers a new doctrine, he has first to elaborate it into an all comprising system. He has to prove that both the first principles of logic and the fundamental universe had existed from all eternity for no other purpose, to ultimately lead to this newly discovered crowning theory. And doctor Dearing, in this respect, was quite up to the Nash mental, moral, natural, and historical, a complete What | 89.20624995231628 | 262.1793749523162 |
| SPEAKER_2 | and against But he's done this before, though, too. In fact, in a attempt at a complete revolution in science Yeah. But also, he was pushing | 277.8793749809265 | 341.67999998092654 |

| SPEAKER_1 | At the request of my friend, Paul Lafargue, now representative of Lille and the Deputies, I arranged 3 chapters of this book as a pan pamphlet, which he translated and published in 18/80 under the title Socialisme uto From this French text, a Polish and a Spanish were prepared.

The appendix, the mark, was written with the intention of among the German socialist party some elementary knowledge of the history and development of landed property in Germany. This seemed all the more necessary at a time when | 387.3193550109863 | 466.52000001098634 |

This appendix has been included in the translation as the original form of tenure of land common to all Teutonic tribes, and and the history of their decay are even less known in England and | 412.6693549156189 | 487.2999999156189 |
| SPEAKER_3 | text | 431.57999992370605 | 431.74999992370607 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I have left the text as it stands in the original without alluding to the high hypothesis recently stated by Maxim Kovalevsky according to which the partition of the arable and meadow lands among the members of the mark was preceded by their being cultivated for joint account by a large patriarchal family community, embracing several generations As So about the, | 432.649405002594 | 510.930000002594 |
| SPEAKER_4 | of 18 | 442.5699999332428 | 443.0599999332428 |
| SPEAKER_1 | aspirations of the military, So here's an article from Fed week This is from, February 20, 2024. In armed forces news, army planning a wider role in the space domain. | 456.95937490463257 | 525.7199599046327 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the assimilation by that party | 466.5199999809265 | 468.2699999809265 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So the mission director for the National Space to Defense Center in the picture there points to a screen in front of a Space Force first lieutenant at Shriver Space Force Base, Colorado. So this is the US military getting involved overtly in space command. Let's see what else we have. It's a pretty short article. The army is formulating plans to play a greater role in the space domain. Quote, integrating joint and army space capability into the operations process must become second nature to commanders at every echelon. Chief of staff general Randy a George said. As the service unveiled its army space vision supporting multidomain operations initiative. We accomplished this by incorporating these capabilities into training, education, education, experiments, and exercises. Fulfilling the initiative's goal would require more investment in space capabilities and formations, to sort of stated in an announcement. They're kinda just getting going with this. The service is professionals are being charged with leading the effort to place soldiers in a position where they can work within the centers of excellence combat training centers, and other services institutions. Training would entail the use of live and virtual environments that would be akin to those encountered in future complex and uncertain battlefields. A vision paper accompanying the Army's announcement expressed the need to create, quote, expeditionary, scalable, and mobile army space formations empowered by flexible command relationships at Echelon, Which should move alongside and keep pace with ground combat formations to protect forces and enable the army to win decisively. This is the creepiest, In essence, service leaders believe that a better understanding of space as a combat theater would provide better protection for ground Thus allow them to prevail in any fight, quote, by design, army space capabilities are built to collocate with and operate alongside ground maneuver formations. Providing the appropriate effects for commanders to maintain timing tempo, and synchronization, as you said. So they're looking at this expansion into space basically as a way to enhance what's going on on the ground. The integration of friendly assets within the army, the other armed services, and commercial paves the way for interdiction of adversaries Again, the language that they use here, interdiction of adversaries by directing fires, observation, counter surveillance, and reconnaissance, navigation, and targeting of countersatellite communications threats. So this is, | 471.13937497138977 | 689.5099999713898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | in Germany. | 487.2999999523163 | 487.95999995231625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you know, expanding | 511.25002002716064 | 512.0700000271606 |

| SPEAKER_5 | The explanation has been that the fire inside was so intense that it weakened the structural steel and that each floor collapsed down on the yeah. I think that space is what I've done is to analyze, these reports. But I would like to do experiment architecture if I could. I send out a, a video clip of collapse of building 7.

| SPEAKER_12 | Welcome to The Great Conspiracy, the 9 11 news special you never saw. On this program, we ask questions the 911 Commission and the media Who? Never asked. | 1226.0393750667572 | 1292.540000066757 |
| SPEAKER_7 | responsible. Who? | 1226.880000114441 | 1229.060000114441 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Jones. | 1233.7999999523163 | 1234.0399999523163 |
| SPEAKER_5 | We | 1236.9993751049042 | 1237.2393751049042 |

| SPEAKER_7 | or whatever. | 1249.5299999713898 | 1250.2699999713898 |
| SPEAKER_7 | whatever. Here. Let's see. I don't know. | 1257.2200999259949 | 1259.199999925995 |
| SPEAKER_12 | That's another story. For instance, before we commit to a war, based on a threat, we are told to fear. Before we commit our children's blood and 1,000,000,000 of dollars to them We better be sure the threat is real. That a clear and present danger exists because war itself is to be feared. US president Franklin Delano Roosevelt fought fear Today's leaders traffic in it, chiefly the fear | 1282.979374885559 | 1369.419999885559 |
| SPEAKER_12 | introduce | 1293.2200000286102 | 1293.7000000286102 |

| SPEAKER_5 | before | 1295.1400001049042 | 1295.6400001049042 |
| SPEAKER_12 | and provide background, You never get it. We recommend books, magazines, videos, and DVD probably never heard of. And websites the media keep under wraps. We avoid thought stoppers such as anti American, and conspiracy theorists. And that new word, believed to be linked to Al Qaeda. US president Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself. And indeed, fear may well be the greatest single human motivator It can serve us and it can save us. But ill founded | 1295.7799999713898 | 1338.1099999713897 |
| SPEAKER_12 | Terrorism. That's it. Not global warming, not the end of oil. Not domestic and worldwide injustice. Not rampant militarism, not war itself, or even war without end. Just terrorism. The words are hypnotically repeated. Terrorism. Terrorist, terrorist threat. And, of course, believed to be linked to Al Qaeda. | 1314.4093749523163 | 1393.599999952316 |

| SPEAKER_0 | you. Okay. Are you going to sleep? Okay. Are you | 1666.7314040660858 | 1682.871404066086 |
| SPEAKER_1 | On one side, ours, the use of terror either is not admitted or simply defined as not. Terror. The other side's terror is defined as the only kind of terror. Terror then needs to be put into perspective. Perspective writes Lawrence Martin, former Washington correspondent for the Golden is a ghost in American journalism. Last year, acts of terrorism killed 300 to 400 people. Ranking it so far down the list of dangers that it is bare barely visible. He might have added that 300 is the number of Americans struck by lightning each year. Another note about appearance and reality. The vast majority of people arrested as terrorism suspects are released without charges being laid. It's the arrest stories with those Arab names in picture that remain in the public mind as reality. Isn't there a pattern of state sponsored media abented deception here? But the dirtiest secret about terrorism is also by far the largest. Many spectacular acts of terrorism are fearsome fake crimes carried out by cabal within governments, and I I mean our own governments. The gold standard is the attack on one's own country to mobilize public opinion for power, political gain, and profit. The Nazis masterminded the torching of the Reichstag, the German parliament buildings. On February 27, 1933, 1 week before a national election, That they did so is historical fact. Portrayed best in William l. Dreiber's masterpiece, the and fall of the 3rd Reich. Within hours, Hitler and his henchmen designate the communists as the villains and label them terrorists. The government promises proof, but never provides it. The communists did not do it. A single communist was the patsy. The big lie of who torched the rice stake is used by Hitler to solve fear. He bullies the German president to sign a decree, suspending 7 main articles of the German constitution. The claim is that the fatherland, think homeland, is under threat. Ensuing arrests and murders of communist and socialist terrorize anti Hitler descent. In the ensuing election, Hitler does not get the majority he needs to do. But soon after, he essentially sees his power. He then is free to launch preemptive strikes against other countries and wage a world war sold as patriotic. The ultimate result for Germans is calamities. 600,000 civilians dead, 7 and a half 1000000 homeless, their country broke in ruins. The Rice Tag Fire was a major turning point. Within hours of the planes crashing into the World Trade Center, the Bush White House designates the alleged villains. Within 30 days, the US constitution and civil liberties of Americans are weakened by near unanimous passage of the Patriot Act. A war on terror is announced. Within months, preemptive strikes are launched against Afghanistan and Iraq. So no evidence is produced that Iraq took part in 911. Descent in the USA is under fire even as millions in the USA and worldwide oppose the Iraq war. The White House announces that the war on terror, in effect world war, may never end. At least a 1,000 Americans are soon to die in Iraq alone. Expenditures mount into the trillions. The so called war on terrorism justifies the mounting deaths of US soldiers and civilians in Iraq and elsewhere. Justifies the little publicized construction of giant new US military bases overseas and is the basis for the doctor of preemptive war. Contrary to international law and basic morality. It's responsible for grotesquely ballooning deficits to pay for all this. Debt's being passed on to coming generations. And plans for even more expenditures on terror fighting pure bureaucracies. The so called war on terror is cited as the ultimate base for sharp increases in domestic spying and reduction in freedoms in civil liberties at home and attempts to criminalize descent. All this because the official authorized truth is that foreign terrorists attacked the USA on 911. As we tape this in the summer of 2004, fear grows as authorities and pundits predict more terrorist events. On the scale of 911, or greater, The I word inevitable is increasingly used. | 1669.610769033432 | 2021.371424033432 |

| SPEAKER_1 | about despotism. This man makes it his job to study these things. Well, for one thing, avoid the comfortable idea that the mere form of doubt can of itself save the nation against despotism Welcome back to The Great Conspiracy. The 9 11 news special you never saw. If 911 is a big lie, a fake attack, an inside job, is it unique? No. Quite the reverse. Most war triggering incidents are great deception. The Mexican American war, the Spanish American war, the attack on Pearl Harbor, all involved sea secretly contrived attacks on Americans planned or encouraged by American The Vietnam War, and Desert Storm in 1991 also were triggered by deceptions involving US presidents. So the if 911 is not such a deception, It's an exception. To the rule, Most people want peace most of the time. That's a problem for rulers bent on war. History teaches that rulers arranging for their country to be attacked by appear to be attacked is the fastest method ever these rulers to get their way when they want war. Consider only 3 cases. Starting with this book, Body of Secrets. Author James Bamford is a former Washington investigative producer for ABC's World News Tonight with Peter Jennings. I learned of this book on ABC's website. Bamford's information comes from interviews. With, for instance, the former dean of the US Intelligence Community. And from government documents. It takes 80 pages to list Bamford's more than 600 information sources. Here's the story. It's 1962. John f Kennedy is US president. Robert McNamara is secretary of defense. And admiral Lyman Lemnisir heads the US joint chiefs of staff. The CIA fails in its illegal Bay of JFK decides, Bamford writes. To back away from military solutions to the Cuban problem. But Lemannitzer, the CIA, and others at the top remain obsessed with Cuba. Writes Bamford, | 2049.3611500263214 | 2254.0617850263216 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Trapped inside the cocoon spun by the North American media industry that they're is in fact widespread skepticism about who was behind 911. 30% of Germans, according to reliable Polls, think the US government had a hand in it. They remember that big rice tag deception. This poll done in Canada in May 2004 showed 63% of Canadians think individuals within the US government, including the White House, had prior knowledge of the plans for the events of September 11th and failed to take appropriate action to stop them. In this program, we present some of the accumulating evidence indicating that lying behind the great deception of 911 is the great conspiracy of 911. But first, more historical context. When we come back, 3 true | 2049.5117750167847 | 2106.271775016785 |

As we've seen throughout time, women have been expected adhere to a lot of seemingly arbitrary and contradictory beauty standards. Beauty standards are the societal ideals and expectations of people, particularly women and them presenting people, are expected to meet to be perceived as beautiful. In a lot of cases, studies have shown that meeting these standards can even be necessary to attain success or higher wages, many respects to the need certain standards too, but I'm just gonna focus on the quarterly's today.

Being tam, however, meant you could afford to travel because you were either part of the ruling class or in close enough proximity to the ruling class to separate yourself from those force. Although, of course, because western beauty standards are Eurocentric and prioritize whiteness, it was specifically white skinned with a tan of things that we consider attractive. Not naturally dark skinned. Beauty standards are so seemingly arbitrary and honestly goofy as hell. And physically and mentally harmful for all of them, which is bad. As an artist, I love beauty. I love looking at beautiful things, beautiful works of art, beautiful people, and I love creating beautiful things.

| SPEAKER_0 | Accounts for the special character of them, and there's specific the | 0 | 6.329996000000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is quite possible that the relative strength of these two drives is in the main fixed by inheritance. But the person a man happens to find himself during his development. By the structure of the society in which he grows up by the tradition of that society, and by its appraisal of particular types of behavior. The abstract concept society means to the individual human being the sum total of indirect and indirect relations to his contemporaries, and to all the people of earlier generations. The individual is able to think, feel, strive, and work by himself But he depends so much upon society. In his physical, intellectual, and emotional existence that it is impossible to think of him or to understand him outside the frame It is society which provides me with food, clothing, a home, the tools of work, language, the forms of thought, and most of the content of thought. His life is made possible through the labor and the accomplishments of the many millions past and present who are all hidden behind the small word. Society. It is evident, therefore, that the dependence of the individual upon society is a fact of nature which cannot be abolished. Just as in the case of ants and bees. However, while the whole life process of ants and bees is fixed down to the smallest detail, by rigid hereditary instincts the social pattern and interrelationships of human beings are very variable and susceptible to change. Memory, the capacity to make new combinations, the gift of oral communication, have made possible developments among human beings, which are not dictated by biological necessities. Such developments manifest themselves in traditions, institutions, and organizations. In literature, in scientific and engineering accomplishments, in works of art, This explains how it happens that in a certain sense, man can influence his life through his own conduct, and that in this process, conscious thinking and wanting can play a part. Man requires at birth through heredity a biological constitution which we must consider fixed and unalterable, including the natural urges, which are characteristic of the human species. In addition, during his lifetime, acquires a cultural constitution. Which he adopts from society through communication. And through many other types of influences. It is this cultural constitution which, with the passage of time, is subject to change and which determines to a very large extent relationships between the individual and society. Modern anthropology has taught us through comparative investigation of so called primitive cultures, that the social behavior of human beings may differ greatly depending on prevailing cultural patterns and the types of organization which predominate in society. It is on this that those who are striving to improve the lot of man made around their hopes human beings are not condemned because of their biological constitution to annihilate each other or to be at the mercy of a cruel self inflicted fate. If we ask ourselves how the structure of society and the cultural attitude of man should be changed, in order to make human life as satisfying as possible we should constantly be conscious of the fact that there are certain conditions which we are unable to process. Of man is for all practical purposes not subject to change. Furthermore, technological and demographic development of the last few centuries have come in commission of what they're here to say. The time, we looking back, we saw I do it, it's gone forever. Briefly what to me constitutes the essence of the crisis of our time. It concerns the relationship of the individual to society. An individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society. But he does not experience this dependence as a positive asset as an organic tie, as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights. Or even to his economic existence. Moreover, his position in society is such that the egotistical drives of his makeup are constantly being accentuated while the social drives, which are by nature weaker progressively deteriorate, All human beings whatever their position in society, are suffering from this process of deterioration. Unknowingly prisoners of their own egotism, They feel insecure, lonely, and deprived of the naive, simple unsophisticated enjoyment of life. Man can't find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through devoting himself to society. The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. We've seen before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unseasonably striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor. Not by force, but on the hall in thankful compliance when we do establish rules. It is in this respect important to realize that the means of production that is to say the entire productive capacity that is needed for producing consumer goods as well as additional capital goods may legally be, and for the most part, r. The private property of individuals. For the sake of simplicity and the discussion that follows, I shall call work All those who do not share in the ownership of the means of production Although, this does not quite correspond to the customary use of the term. Owner of the means of production is in a position to purchase the labor power of the worker. By using the means of production, the worker produces new goods, which becomes a property of the capitalist. The essential point about this process is the relation between what the worker produces and what he is paid. Both measured in terms of real value. Insofar as the labor contract is quote free, what the worker receives is determined not by the real value of the goods he produces, but by his minimum needs. And by the capitalist requirements for labor power, in relation to the number of workers competing for jobs. It is important to understand that even in theory, the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product. Private capital tends to become the the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encurs the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists to for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature, The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not, in fact, sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control directly or indirectly the main source of information press radio education. It is thus extremely difficult and indeed in most cases quite impossible for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights. The situation prevailing in an economy based on the private ownership of capital is thus characterized by 2 main principles. 1st, means of production capital, are privately owned, and the owners dispose of them as they see fit. 2nd, the labor contract is free. Of course, there is no such thing as a pure capitalist society in the In particular, it should be noted that the workers through long and bitter political struggles, have succeeded in securing a somewhat improved form. Of the, quote, free labor contract for certain categories of workers. But taken as a whole, the present day economy does not differ much from, quote, pure capitalism. Production is carried on for profit, not for use. There is no provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find employment. An army of unemployed almost always exists. The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job. Since unemployed and permanently paid workers do not provide a profitable market, the production of consumers goods is restricted, and great hardship is the consequence. Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all. The profit motive in conjunction with competition among capitalists is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor, | -55.540625 | 601.3 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Hi. Welcome to Socialism For All. Today's date is March 22, 2020. This is an audio recording of Albert Einstein's 1949 essay. So in the upper. Okay. Now it's the essay. Is it advisable for one who is not an expert on economic and social issues to express views on the subject of socialism. I believe for a number of reasons that it is. Let us first consider the question from the point of view of scientific knowledge. It might appear that there are no essential methodological differences between astronomy and economics. Scientists in both fields attempt to discover laws of general acceptability for a circumscribed group of phenomena in order to make interconnection of these phenomena as clearly understandable as possible. But in reality, such methodological differences do exist. The discovery of general laws in the field of economics is made difficult by the circumstance that observed economic phenomena are often affected by many factors which are hard to evaluate separately. In addition, the experience which has accumulated since the beginning of the so called civilized period of human history has as is well known, been largely in influenced and limited by causes which are by no means exclusively economic in nature. For example, most of the major states of history owed their existence to conquest. The conquering peoples established themselves legally and economically as the privileged class of the conquered country. They seized for themselves a monopoly of the land ownership and appointed a priesthood from among their own ranks. The priests in control of anxiety into a permanent and value. | 0 | 224.500615 |

| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know. Yeah. Yes. I don't remember what it's called. | 3257.783651 | 3316.964176 |
| SPEAKER_5 | According to Forbes, roughly 78% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, causing over half of US workers to fear losing their job more than death itself. Yet Americans still spend over $300 a month on impulse per purchases alone, spending roughly $18,000 a year on non essential goods. Raising that concern, how did consumerism become our way of living? While the United States has experienced unprecedented periods of consumerism, This concept of a relentless pursuit towards material goods is not unique to the US and is rather the financial and moral implications of a society driven driven by excessive consumption. In the early 16th century, European states and their American colonies enforced some turing laws to curb the desire | 3278.9336510000003 | 3386.874276 |
| SPEAKER_2 | of | 3386.874276 | 3387.184276 |
| SPEAKER_5 | luxury and extravagance. The Venetian senate in 15/12 limited wedding gifts to just 6 forks and 6 | 3331.763651 | 3393.8242760000003 |

| SPEAKER_5 | Women were even fined or thrown in jail for elegant items such as the cotton neckerchief. The cloth were seen as | 3399.904276 | 3406.604276 |
| SPEAKER_3 | a nod | 3406.604276 | 3407.1241760000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | for moral decadence as virtue. In a society, an endless pursuit of material items, would ultimately invoke the sin of vanity. On 17th and 18th century, as economies began to flourish, for once luxury item were now considered common goods. And in Side of all elites now flaunted jeweled comfort the greatest luxury was a life no longer centered on survival. And as a restraint of desire was lifted, life was now centered on a greater pleasure of material comfort, marking | 3407.1241760000003 | 3450.294276 |
| SPEAKER_2 | this | 3450.434276 | 3450.484276 |

| SPEAKER_3 | this. | 3466.5243760000003 | 3466.764376 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Seeking, ambition, greed, vanity, and luxury are an industry virtues like honesty. Despite criticism from the financial prosperity resulting from consumerism could not be | 3466.764376 | 3488.0342760000003 |
| SPEAKER_4 | ignored, | 3432.453651 | 3432.953651 |
| SPEAKER_5 | raising the question, 1759, known as the father of modern economics, wrote the theory of moral sentiments, where he argued that wealth consumption is necessary, it alone cannot ensure the happiness. He stated happiness consists of tranquility and enjoyment. Without tranquility, there can be no enjoyment. As before we can feel much for others, we must in some measure be at ease ourselves. And the World of Nations published in 17 76, Smith argues that once an individual pursuit of self interest However, he warned against excessive pursuit of trivial items.

| SPEAKER_5 | right | 3543.1742759999997 | 3543.6742759999997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | here, he's basically yeah. | 3543.814276 | 3544.694276 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Provided the economic prosperity for society. | 3545.014376 | 3492.023551 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But they just conveniently forget about the kinds of ideas you had. | 3548.304276 | 3551.664276 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Ultimately, inspired American capitalism, it is Manaville's approach that we more closely emulate setting the foundation for the conflict that many of us face face today. If consumerism is deemed essential for economic prosperity and personal well-being or happiness depends fundamentally on obtaining consumer goods and material possessions. Then how is it that in a world of endless consumption where greed, jealousy, and hate is now the nature status quo that Americans hold over $1,100,000,000,000 in credit card debt. Debt, the highest ever reported, where 49% of Americans can't even afford a $1,000 emergency expense. And we're more than 61% of Americans use feel chronically low lying. Unfortunately, I believe this to be a result of what Adam Smith and other philosophers overlooked as it's not the satiation of of the consumer that is worth considering, rather the satiation of the | 3551.964276 | 3606.9942760000004 |
| SPEAKER_4 | business | 3551.493651 | 3551.9736510000002 |
| SPEAKER_5 | interest. As a manipulation of what Adam Smith called the invisible hand would ultimately dictate the life of the consumer. In 1902, attempt to promote education to the common person John d Rockefeller donated over $1,000,000 to establish the general education | 3607.9542760000004 | 3627.014276 |

| SPEAKER_5 | reveal a far different story. Although it is often attributed to Horace Mann, largely considered the father of American education, His model was directly inspired | 3574.523551 | 3639.514276 |
| SPEAKER_4 | by his | 3639.514276 | 3639.994176 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Also, | 4152.401918 | 4152.901918 |
| SPEAKER_2 | While society has been meticulously engineered and manufactured, to squeeze every last drop out of the consumer what I like to call a human being | 4153.581888 | 4218.922513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. | 4165.341888 | 4165.841888 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Mhmm. | 4188.611888 | 4189.011928 |
| SPEAKER_2 | With the average American spending roughly 524 $1,000 in taxes, throughout one's life. It was never intended for us It's not intended for us to be together like that. That at large, we are a data point for the economy. The economy is not Representation of the American consumer. Of the American human needs. Financial independence. And as we are able to do so, that allows us to then do what I believe in what Adam Smith stated, to have virtuous endeavors. To be able to take care of ourselves and our neighbors. | 4244.992553 | 4310.192513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Not allowed to do that. Fades | 4256.4118880000005 | 4259.871858 |
| SPEAKER_2 | us into our second part. You need division to create dependency. Yep. That you need us to be arguing against each other You need us to not be a happy, enjoyable, creative, fulfilled society. Because that doesn't print headlines.

| SPEAKER_3 | sue you for your company and | 4335.032513 | 4336.582513 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What? Politicians. | 4290.711888 | 4347.912483 |

| SPEAKER_2 | they were in gatekeepers. | 4351.527513 | 4352.792543 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. | 4303.461888 | 4303.961888 |
| SPEAKER_2 | We can make it even better. I believe we have the components for that society. It comes from us being able to have the right conversations the right interactions, isn't from society's perception of you. None of that is real. It doesn't matter. It's a false reality. What is real is | 4319.571928 | 4407.002513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. And or is nobody you mean you on the other side of the screen maybe would be more. I can wear just | 4357.021938 | 4419.682513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | as much | 4419.682513 | 4419.949163 |
| SPEAKER_2 | from you | 4419.949163 | 4420.562513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | as you can. But for him, I guess it is kind of on the other side of the camera. Inside our neighbors, our | 4420.562513 | 4425.512513 |
| SPEAKER_2 | loved ones, and individuals such as that. Is we do our best If you're able to provide a helping hand and a to lean on to the person in front of you, Do your best at doing that. And if you can't, do your best at lumping in. Because you are enough. You are doing is enough. You are not just some | 4425.512513 | 4454.022513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. Wait. So I saw this post and, like, it totally I don't know, it made perfect fucking sense. But this post was, like, somebody reposted a Like, social media thing. It was like a poll or question or whatever about like, sit like, that was meant for, like, I guess, leftist or people who were, like, No. Did they are legitimately. It was just, what? Tell, name something or talk about how what radicalized you or how you were radicalized, something like that, and this chick reposted, like, took a screenshot of it, whatever, or replied to it, whatever it is. And she said that, that there was a veteran that used to live next to her and her mom And Sometimes. He couldn't pay his water, so it got shut | 4398.761888 | 4512.272513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | off. | 4512.272513 | 4512.622513 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And so | 4457.441888 | 4514.242513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | her and her mom would allow him or let him come use the water from their water hose whenever that happened. | 4459.511928 | 4520.902513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Oh, | 4465.801888 | 4465.881928 |
| SPEAKER_0 | shit. And then | 4521.862553 | 4524.362553 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, you know, he couldn't afford it being a veteran and all. You know? Couldn't afford his like, to pay his water sometimes. And she said that, like, the moment they came and turned off our water for helping him and paying for our The water? That's the moment I was radicalized. I was like, that makes that that right there is | 4470.331888 | 4544.836553 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the they're cooking water. | 4544.836553 | 4546.172513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | For helping somebody who couldn't pay their water. They were paying theirs. So, like, I was like, that is, like, exactly that is exactly the case. Like, that's exactly | 4546.292543 | 4554.532473 |
| SPEAKER_0 | they do not want us taking care of each other. | 4554.612513 | 4556.892513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | They do not want us no. It's not crabs and buckets. These people are at the | 4501.471888 | 4560.972513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | top. | 4560.972513 | 4561.432513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | They're not crabs and buckets. They're not like us at all. They want us to not like each other, not help each other. They want us to have no answers. They want us be in a state of despair and only care about ourselves. That's why they try so hard. That's why that's all we see and all we hear. But, like, like, I don't know. I feel like like there's no, like I don't know. That was a very good illustration of exactly that that like there's no explanation for why you would turn off their water They're paying for the water that he's using. Yeah. Like, | 4505.771888 | 4596.572513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you | 4596.572513 | 4596.612553 |

| SPEAKER_1 | not still, like, | 4597.332513 | 4598.1325130000005 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you know, | 4598.1325130000005 | 4598.732513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Obviously, I didn't think he was stealing her, so it wouldn't have off in the water. They would just tell them and then to ask, you know, say you can make a police report or something. I don't know. But like, yeah. That's I mean, I don't | 4543.311888 | 4610.542543 |

| SPEAKER_0 | I | 4693.731888 | 4693.811888 |
| SPEAKER_3 | guess. I | 4749.792513 | 4750.512513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | guess. Because we see, the thing is we know | 4750.512513 | 4752.952513 |
| SPEAKER_0 | the how. | 4752.952513 | 4753.852513 |

| SPEAKER_2 | for | 4754.832513 | 4754.992513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you is, like, why But then whenever I fucking thought about it as I was saying it, that's when I said how, because, like, that's | 4754.992513 | 4761.062513 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. No. I know. But the thing is we know the how, but we don't know. I don't know. I literally | 4710.681888 | 4774.782513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | just heard somebody say this | 4718.801888 | 4775.822513 |
| SPEAKER_2 | thing. Personally, I need reading, so I just upload | 4775.822513 | 4777.862513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. I heard somebody say something like that earlier. But I'm not sure. But we know the how. | 4726.571888 | 4787.332413 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Build a wide | 4787.492413 | 4788.3025130000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | base But it won't be just a wall. | 4732.321888 | 4789.662513 |
| SPEAKER_2 | More | 4789.902513 | 4790.142513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | educated | 4790.142513 | 4790.382413 |
| SPEAKER_2 | than 90% of of people and allow you to have a | 4790.382413 | 4793.082513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | massive | 4793.082513 | 4793.162613 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. | 4793.242513 | 4793.482513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Wait. | 4793.482513 | 4793.982513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I just tell phrase has | 4794.032013 | 4795.172613000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | become cliche. Culture is scripted. Sounds crazy. I know. Let me explain. The average American spends 7 hour | 4795.172613000001 | 4801.6725129999995 |
| SPEAKER_5 | hours a day looking at a screen. More and more, we are products of the media we can But here's the thing. That media is not neutral. People. Sure. I was disillusioned by the status quo, but I didn't have the tools to understand what I was seeing. I just knew I was being lied to. When | 4745.931888 | 4827.622513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I discovered | 4827.622513 | 4828.022613 |
| SPEAKER_5 | this book, it was like | 4828.022613 | 4829.1725129999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | There's your top five list. This is top 5 leftist books that changed my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my | 4776.551888 | 4835.882113 |
| SPEAKER_6 | my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my | 4835.882113 | 4838.272513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | that. | 4782.531888 | 4783.031888 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I | 4839.4724129999995 | 4839.5525130000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | was just curious, | 4839.5525130000005 | 4840.532513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | but I was | 4840.752413 | 4840.992413 |
| SPEAKER_1 | at more interest than | 4840.992413 | 4786.701888 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I | 4842.682513 | 4842.762513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | thought it would be? By one very simple framework. Follow the money. And when we follow the media's money, it becomes very clear who's in charge. A simple fact is media companies are beholden to their advertisers, to their owners, and to their source sources if they wanna stay in business. On paper, these media outlets | 4842.762513 | 4858.472513000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Also, | 4802.731888 | 4803.231888 |
| SPEAKER_4 | they're owned by very rich people | 4859.272613 | 4860.192613 |
| SPEAKER_1 | reality man. Who have business ventures. | 4860.6325130000005 | 4862.332513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Rich and powerful in order to keep operating. So these surf level claims about media bias that are so common in our culture they're true. But if you bother to dig a little deeper and understand how narrative control actually | 4806.891788 | 4819.121888 |
| SPEAKER_1 | functions They only they only know it's true in a sense that, like, | 4875.102513 | 4877.842513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | that | 4823.031888 | 4823.351788 |
| SPEAKER_0 | left in left the no. Sorry. Not | 4879.332413 | 4880.932513 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Russian. | 4880.932513 | 4881.432513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Republicans and Democrats used that against each other if, like, it's too biased in those two directions. That's it. | 4825.9918880000005 | 4887.902513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Step by step, but also explores real life examples of this frame control in | 4888.522513 | 4892.982513 |
| SPEAKER_7 | action. The first part | 4892.982513 | 4894.182613 |
| SPEAKER_5 | that you to | 4894.182613 | 4841.031988000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | peak behind | 4898.512613 | 4843.808588 |
| SPEAKER_5 | the task. | 4899.789213 | 4900.162513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | There you go. There you go. | 4900.162513 | 4901.282613 |
| SPEAKER_5 | This second book may be realized that everything I thought I knew about the cold war was wrong. In fact, even the name Cold War feeds into the official narrative that this was a straightforward diplomatic conflict between the US and the USSR. In reality, what we called the pull forward was | 4901.282613 | 4917.842513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | a decades | 4917.842513 | 4918.162513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | long | 4918.162513 | 4918.562513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | complicated, | 4918.562513 | 4919.062513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | struggle for control of the world, and billions of innocent people were caught in the crossfire. If we bother to listen to their stories, we understand that the Cold War wasn't really cold at all. This book is about the places where the Cold war got hot, places we don't hardly ever hear about, like in Indonesia where the | 4864.431988 | 4935.942513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | US | 4935.942513 | 4936.342513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | sponsored an anti communist dictatorship that killed upwards of a1000000 people. Or in Guatemala where it bombed the capital city and funded an illegal coup to overthrow the Democrat Why? To prevent reform that would have bought out land belonging US fruit companies and given it back to the Guam people. The military dictatorship that the US supported went on to kill 100 of 1000 of civilians and wage a brutal campaign genocide against the indigenous population. That last example is really near to my heart. In 2020, when I visited Guatemala to do humanitarian humanitarian work, I had the chance to meet and work with some of these indigenous people, many of whom lived in extreme poverty without electricity or running water. But it wasn't until years later when I read this book that I was able to put the pieces together. What I had seen was not an exception, and it wasn't an accident either. Millions of others in the 3rd world, the Guatemalan people were victims of a ruthless strategy of imperial | 4880.681888 | 4992.322513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | To call the third | 4992.522513 | 4993.3025130000005 |
| SPEAKER_6 | world. | 4937.641788 | 4937.748488 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Reading | 4993.835813 | 4993.942513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | his | 4993.942513 | 4994.235813 |
| SPEAKER_5 | book and understanding the | 4994.235813 | 4995.882413 |
| SPEAKER_4 | scope | 4996.182513 | 4996.2224129999995 |
| SPEAKER_5 | of the Cold War, I | 4996.2224129999995 | 4997.3025130000005 |
| SPEAKER_4 | don't think | 4997.3025130000005 | 4997.622413 |
| SPEAKER_5 | it's an exaggeration to say that World War 3 already happened, and I witnessed the aftermath Firsthand. The second book had massively shifted my perspective was the | 4997.622413 | 5008.669213 |
| SPEAKER_4 | chacada massacre. | 5008.669213 | 5009.175813 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That that was the book I was reading, by the way, | 5009.175813 | 5011.132413 |
| SPEAKER_4 | when | 5011.132413 | 5011.452513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know if you remember when you and I stuff I said I was reading this book called the Jakarta method. Sounds familiar. Yeah. And that was | 4955.711888 | 5018.182513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | it. | 5018.242513 | 5018.292513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The one he just described. I just talked about all that. Video that sort of covers this | 4962.551888 | 5025.382413 |
| SPEAKER_5 | similar topic. So if you're interested Great. | 5025.382413 | 5027.5525130000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Check that out | 4971.811888 | 5028.272513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | after this. This book is one of the most insightful cases for socialism that I think I've ever read. And you'll never guess who wrote it. Here's my favorite line. It's the opening line, actually. Is it advisable for one who is not an expert on economic or social issues to express views on the subject of socialism? I believe, for a number of reasons, that it is. This line really helped me think about politics in a different way. Because I thought | 5028.272513 | 5052.702513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | about | 5052.702513 | 5053.002513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | economics as a science, I used to believe it was something best left to the experts, but then this book convinced me of the exact opposite. It is essential that ordinary people take it upon themselves to learn about economics, to learn about politics. Why? Because economics | 4997.261888 | 5068.892613 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Wait. Didn't you say who | 5069.212513 | 5070.1325130000005 |
| SPEAKER_5 | wrote it? Tell us how, but it can't tell us why. | 5070.1325130000005 | 5017.421988 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Science You say okay. That's that's really | 5073.402613 | 5074.762613 |
| SPEAKER_7 | and Yes. | 5074.842513 | 5075.522613 |
| SPEAKER_1 | In those ends, the | 5075.642613 | 5076.612513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | goals, those priorities, cannot be set by scientists and technocrats. They must be set by the people. You shouldn't let anyone tell you that it's not your business to decide what kind of world gets passed on to your children. Here's something that nobody on the left really talks about. Being smart enough to see past capitalist propaganda doesn't really make you a free thinker. If you're just parroting the talking points of your favorite creator, that's not very helpful. Is it? This book gave me the push I needed to stop letting other people do my thinking for me. I | 5021.1919880000005 | 5109.682613 |
| SPEAKER_4 | wanted | 5109.682613 | 5109.902513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | to discover the truth for myself, and that's a big reason why I ended up getting my degree in economics. This book is very brief, very understandable, and it's written | 5054.321888 | 5118.582513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | by | 5118.582513 | 5118.822513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | one of history's most I must say | 5118.822513 | 5120.742513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | kinda lot of them. | 5120.742513 | 5121.302613 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Entitled why | 5121.5075130000005 | 5066.171988 |
| SPEAKER_8 | I think it's | 5122.192513 | 5123.002513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | it was written | 5067.021888 | 5124.212513 |
| SPEAKER_8 | by | 5069.751888000001 | 5069.831888000001 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Albert Einstein. | 5125.812513 | 5126.522513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | This | 5071.021788 | 5071.181888 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is one of the most I mean, that's crazy that this is, like thing. I don't know. I didn't know you wrote a book called why satanism. Let | 5127.162513 | 5133.162513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | me | 5133.162513 | 5133.412513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | explain. The fifties sixties, there was a moment where it really looked like the Soviet Union might economically surpass the United States. There was a dream that a socialist planned economy could provide abundance for everyone. Never happened, of course. But for a moment, it seems possible. This book follows the evolution of the Soviet economy in all of its core quirks, its possibility, and its tragedy. But the way that it approaches the topic is unlike any book I've ever seen. And it manages to make what would otherwise be a pretty dry topic super compelling. Because it doesn't just recite facts like a normal history. It gives you dozens of tiny windows into the so experience through the stories of everyday people. Some of them real, some of them fictional. And through their lives | 5133.412513 | 5180.092513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But just typical stories. Subject to the | 5180.1725129999995 | 5182.572513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | story, which, of course, is the planned economy itself. And even though the characters are mostly fictional, their lives trace the outline. You | 5182.572513 | 5190.202513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | know, like, how I absurd that they make us think that a planned economy is, like, just the idea of a planned economy is just so absurd authoritarian. The, like, somehow or another, we're not even able to see. They're literally Walmart in and of itself, its whole operation is a planned economy. It manages it does like it plans out the logistics, how much I'll spend on this or that. It knows, like, all of these, you know, how much they'll allocate towards these expenses or whatever. Like, all of these huge corporations or conglomerates are planned economies. But we just like but, oh, planned economy is so, like, horrible. Like, | 5190.202513 | 5228.662513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | what | 5228.662513 | 5228.872513 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Like, | 5173.771888 | 5173.931988 |
| SPEAKER_8 | what? | 5229.912613 | 5229.962513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I'm not familiar with that. Oh, it's | 5174.141888 | 5232.3825130000005 |
| SPEAKER_4 | they use | 5232.462513 | 5232.942513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it when well, it's basically the planned economy, like, fear mongering is related to, like, the Soviet Union or whatever, basically, that you know, it's authoritarian because you'll have to | 5232.942513 | 5245.452513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | plan out, like, you know, the plan out all of how much you can spend on this or that, how much you'll eat, like, all this stupid like yeah. So | 5245.452513 | 5251.7845130000005 |
| SPEAKER_9 | my date | 5251.7845130000005 | 5252.008513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | That's that argument. Planned economy | 5252.120513 | 5254.962513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | basically is | 5254.962513 | 5255.8825130000005 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Authoritarian. | 5256.242513 | 5256.742513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Rations. | 5257.532613 | 5258.032613 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yes. | 5202.711988 | 5203.211988 |
| SPEAKER_4 | But no, that's what they'd say. They also talk about this bread line all the time, but it's like, well, we do stand in bread line all the time. We it's called the It's called a grocery store line. We still stand in line for food. | 5204.111888 | 5272.562513 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But, like, the bread line that they're talking about, like, that's, like, extra rations. Like, you get you get so much bread, but | 5216.801988 | 5278.4225129999995 |
| SPEAKER_4 | You get what | 5278.502513 | 5279.062513 |
| SPEAKER_9 | you need | 5279.062513 | 5279.352513 |
| SPEAKER_7 | to | 5279.352513 | 5279.602513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | They had a more nutritious diet than than the people in the United States. The what's the fuck? What are they called? The CIA said so. Or FBI, one of the 2. A CIA CIA? Yeah. Like they they literally were like, no, they can the same amount of nutrients except their diet is better than ours. | 5223.701888 | 5296.182513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, | 5240.441888 | 5240.761888 |
| SPEAKER_9 | I don't | 5296.742513 | 5297.142613 |
| SPEAKER_5 | know. It's a real historical events. Like Soviet Minister Nikita Khrushchev's visit to | 5297.142613 | 5301.212413 |
| SPEAKER_4 | It's | 5301.612413 | 5301.772513 |
| SPEAKER_6 | not rations. | 5301.772513 | 5302.432513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Like, rations | 5302.492413 | 5302.932413 |
| SPEAKER_7 | is, | 5302.932413 | 5303.212413 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, | 5303.212413 | 5303.452513 |
| SPEAKER_7 | when | 5303.452513 | 5303.772513 |
| SPEAKER_9 | you | 5303.772513 | 5303.812513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | don't have enough so you get people just, like, | 5248.071888 | 5306.572513 |
| SPEAKER_9 | very little. | 5306.572513 | 5307.012513 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Right? City built for the so | 5307.012513 | 5308.482513 |
| SPEAKER_8 | book | 5256.821888 | 5257.021888 |
| SPEAKER_5 | is worth reading for the footnotes alone. It is meticulous | 5257.261888 | 5315.902613 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Yeah. | 5316.162613 | 5316.422613000001 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Researched, | 5316.682613 | 5317.082513 |
| SPEAKER_9 | but | 5317.082513 | 5317.402513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | that's not | 5261.6618880000005 | 5318.202513 |
| SPEAKER_9 | the | 5318.202513 | 5318.282513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | most special thing. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. It's a natural. This book Sorry. Yeah. | 5318.282513 | 5321.262513 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Wait. | 5265.601788 | 5265.681888 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Changed my mindset. We've been trained to think it binary especially when it comes to former socialist experiments. Either Never | 5321.742413 | 5327.952513 |
| SPEAKER_6 | call. | 5327.952513 | 5328.452513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Narrative and they were irredeemable, despotic, hell or you rebel against that and you believe that they were perfect utopias, and anybody who said otherwise must simply be brainwashed. These ideas are comfortably simple, but of course, reality is always more complicated. If you consider yourself a serious thinker, you have to be able to engage with that complicated reality. Reality because before we can judge something, we have to understand it. And this genre defying book will help you understand the | 5273.201988000001 | 5357.522513 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Soviet experience | 5357.522513 | 5358.402513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | in a way | 5358.402513 | 5358.8025130000005 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that human | 5358.8025130000005 | 5359.742513 |
| SPEAKER_5 | the people who actually participated in them. The book is called Fred Plunkett. Check it out. This last bit challenges the most fundamental assumptions of our civilization, and I still don't know how to feel about it other than to say, I'm impressed. Fundamentally, this book is about the climate crisis, but it goes way deeper than that. It's a philosophical examination of why the climate crisis is happening. The COVID limitless growth that capitalism requires in order to survive. You see, we take it for granted in this modern age that we should constantly be expanding, extracting more and more from the Earth to grow the economy. But as the author points out, this mentality is only possible when you see the Earth as a resource to be exploited rather than a living thing deserves respect. This book brings up some really good ideas goes really deep into the philosophical roots of the capitalist system, I still don't know how to feel about it. Sure. One part of me thinks that we should be living in balance with nature rather than dominating it. But the most noble thing we can do on this earth is just work enough to get by spend our time hanging out with the people we love. | 5304.001888000001 | 5427.682513 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Silicon, and it's got 6 minute work time and 20 minutes until it cures. So you can work quickly with this one. Some packing tape. Or clear sheet. And this is gonna be the base for your mold. You're gonna need something to make a border for your mold. So cooking And also some that you want to mold. I'm gonna be making a mold out of crystals. And a tray in a bowl. It's a good idea to try and make molds out of items that have got, like, flat surface. So these crystal will have got, like, a flat base so that when I stick it down to mold, it's really secure. And also when you take it out of the mold, have my face. If you want to save on, wasting silicone, you can actually just keep the from making others Just use the scraps to, like, fill in the gaps. And put in as much as you like. And then just pour the silicone straight over the top and that will just help to fill any, any big gaps So for my first example, I'm gonna using cardboard as the border. So I just cut cardboard to the shape of the mold. Sticky tape so the silicon Once you're happy with the border and the base, you can stick them together using a hot glue gun. Make sure that they're sealed properly. Otherwise, you can leak on the leak out. For the second example, I'm gonna be using a cookie cutter. You should try to make sure that you leave about a centimeter thickness around the edge of your piece that you're choosing to mold. Select the clocking powder technique packing tape is just a little bit before and easier to use. And I just stick my cookie cutter on top of the packing tape. And then stick the pieces inside on top of the tape. And then once again, just use the hot glue gun to seal the base and the water together. If you're using cardboard or a transparency sheet as the base for your mold, you'll need to use a hot glue gun to stick the piece down in Once the molder So mine's a 1 to 1 ratio, and it has a short work time, so you have to work really quickly. Make sure you've got the appropriate that it produces. You can also tap the ball to release any extra bubbles I know professional mold makers use a pressure pot, and this rid of every single bubble that comes out. Because I'm not a professional mold maker, It doesn't matter if I have a few bubbles in the Cinnabas. Once you've let the silicon cure, you can then take the mold out from its casing So just peel off the hot glue from the bottom and then just pop the mold out. Sounds or even cuticle cutters. To get rid of the excess silicon around the piece. | 0 | 418.140625 |

| SPEAKER_4 | keep even vaguely up to date on the news, you've likely seen the Collinses are found before. They've been interviewed a lot over the past few years. It newspapers, on podcasts, on TV, That's because the Collinsers aren't just planning to have lots of kids in because they're quantum children. Nuts. They're the leading light to the | 127.53082500000028 | 92.02020000000039 |
| SPEAKER_3 | niche, | 148.06082500000048 | 148.5408250000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | a vociferous | 148.5408250000005 | 149.1009250000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | movement, which they call pronatalism. So | 149.1009250000002 | 97.20020000000022 |
| SPEAKER_5 | the pro | 153.18082500000037 | 153.66102500000034 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Says no matter what we are going to have demographic collapse in the developed world and it will wreak havoc on the economy. Our goal as an organization is to preserve as much of our existing human diversity as possible into the future. Then hopefully, | 100.11030000000028 | 172.7708250000005 |

| SPEAKER_3 | threat | 173.95082500000035 | 174.23082500000055 |
| SPEAKER_4 | currently facing humanity is not climate change, an important inequality, zoonotic disease, or any of the usual concerns you might have raised about our crisis stricken world, but instead to declining birth | 118.81020000000035 | 188.21082500000057 |
| SPEAKER_3 | rates. It's so much worse than people think. So if you look at the United States, if you project forward the decline in fertility rate we have had in the past 10 years and you assume 1 generation every 30 years, for every 100 Americans, there's only gonna be around 4.3 great grandchildren. The Collins is on the loan. In carving this fear, the humanity might | 188.21082500000057 | 206.81082500000048 |
| SPEAKER_4 | be on the brink of dying out. Pronatalism has become a highly fashionable thought trend in Silicon Valley. Elon Musk has repeatedly stated that what he calls population collapse represents an excess | 206.81082500000048 | 219.08082500000046 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And children to continue as a nation | 235.92049699999998 | 238.98049699999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | There is one critical outcome that lifts individuals has completely failed to deliver, and that is babies | 239.2104968 | 246.320497 |
| SPEAKER_2 | We wanna produce babies in this country. Right? We wanna produce babies. When I first died, making this video, I was pretty skeptical of this whole population collapse thesis. Given the rogue's gallery of populists and reactionaries that become the leading lights of the pro natalism movement, it's | 246.48049699999999 | 263.110497 |
| SPEAKER_0 | easy to | 263.110497 | 263.59049699999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | push it aside as just another | 263.59049699999997 | 265.35049699999996 |
| SPEAKER_0 | conspiracy theory. | 265.35049699999996 | 266.730497 |

| SPEAKER_2 | More time, we're taking down this | 275.830497 | 277.67049699999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | topic. | 277.67049699999995 | 277.990497 |
| SPEAKER_2 | However, the clearer it seems as a time in birth rates really are about to lead to some pretty significant significant social and economic challenges for many countries. Clearly, the country you're watching this from is | 277.990497 | 289.79049699999996 |
| SPEAKER_0 | now. There | 289.850497 | 290.760497 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I wanna try and | 291.72049699999997 | 292.650497 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Secondly, why are they so interested in this crisis over the many other challenges the world is present facing? And thirdly, those approaches to the movement actually has the real solutions, ones which the Collinses must, Trump, and their allies would be unlikely to find silver Any discussion of modern day concern about bird rates has to start with this. This is the population Rather than population collapse, it warns of a ready approaching future in which an exponential rise in the number of big there are more human beings alive on planet Earth. Than planet Earth can adequately sustain. | 239.40987199999998 | 373.27050699999995 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The main premise is that there are 3 0.6000000 people in the world today, and we're adding about 70,000,000 a year, and that's too many. It's too many because we are getting desperately short of food that we're very much short of other resources. And then above all, the brown shellicate light supports the waste disposal are now severely threatened. | 373.410507 | 398.30049699999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | What the population bonds does, share with today's coronavirus is an unapologetic alarm. At its heart, it's the observation that were early cause of doubling time of issue with the population has been exponentially decreasing throughout history. Prior to 16 50, he estimates the global population doubled around 1 every 1000 years. Then in the 200 years between 16/50 and 18/50, it doubled again. Then again in the 80 years following that. By the time the population bomb was published, that doubling time had dropped to just 35 years. Challenges which might come with such a rapid rise in population are fairly obvious. It might be relatively easy | 398.30049699999995 | 441.020497 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to double the | 441.020497 | 441.660507 |
| SPEAKER_1 | global population in 35 years, but it's much harder to increase the size of the | 441.660507 | 446.510497 |
| SPEAKER_2 | global food | 446.510497 | 447.230497 |
| SPEAKER_1 | industry at | 447.230497 | 447.950497 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the rate of required to feed all those extra people. Can you build enough houses for them, enough transport, educate them all, Can the environment take the extra stress they'll place on the planet? | 447.950497 | 460.210497 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Eric's answer is an empath. No. He went on to answer The government's to introduce measures to discourage people from having as many children. | 404.77987199999995 | 469.280487 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The only hope that there is is that we | 413.51987199999996 | 471.580497 |
| SPEAKER_3 | will | 471.580497 | 471.820497 |
| SPEAKER_2 | be able, at least in the United States, through the political process, to get a government that's courageous enough to say, look, we're overpopulated We have to have population control and start moving in that direction. | 471.820497 | 481.200497 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This concern, the signs the global population might one day overwhelm the resources available to | 481.200497 | 486.970497 |
| SPEAKER_3 | feed everyone. Wasn't entirely new. The population bomb is effectively a modernizing adaptation of an | 486.970497 | 493.84049699999997 |

| SPEAKER_1 | world gears up for another Trump term, his supporters are still pushing the lies | 348.0306549999999 | 352.080655 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that | 352.080655 | 352.1606549999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | he's pro worker, anti war, and all about draining the swamp. Whatever that means. But as we will see, not only is this not true, it's the complete opposite of who Trump really | 352.1606549999999 | 362.49065499999995 |
| SPEAKER_4 | is. I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in here and you just say, you wanna quit? You go on strike. I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and use it This might come as a shock to you, but big companies are getting bigger. Rich people are getting richer, and vital resources like house housing, business equity, food, and even water are now owned by a smaller share of people than ever before. Groundbreaking journalism, I know. But what most people don't realize is just how concentrated this has really become. Private equity now controls as much as 20% of the entire US economy. Top index funds now owns 20 to 30% of all major companies listed in America, and even good old fashioned fraud is getting bigger and and more concentrated. And who can blame them? Economies of scale have encouraged businesses to scale markets. Responded to too big to fail by becoming too big to fail. But what does this actually mean for regular people? There is the moral argument that so many resources being controlled being controlled by such a small few is, you know, unfair. But let's be already made up your mind on that, and no YouTube video is going to change it one way or the other. Instead, what actually matters here is how much further this can go and what happens to markets when these people have nobody left to sell to but themselves? The last quarter you were able to buy looks like a little bit more than 1500 homes for 656,000,000 | 362.49065499999995 | 443.060655 |
| SPEAKER_3 | dollars | 388.6700299999999 | 388.82998999999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | These investment companies, they wanna make money. That's they're there | 444.810615 | 447.550655 |
| SPEAKER_3 | for. Outrageous is your tax dollars for helping Wall Street buy, single family home. You're subsidizing Wall | 447.550655 | 454.180655 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Street. Water Asset Management in New York City. Then as water becomes scarce, Wall Street sees profits. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, is now the first person to have a now net worth surpassing | 454.180655 | 469.7706549999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | $400,000,000,000 | 469.7706549999999 | 470.2706549999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Private equity has become the boogeyman of finance just like hedge funds were in the 20 tens and sometimes for a good reason. Reason. Average people have been told to hate them. Insufferable Wharton grads want to intern with them, and the industry is making more billionaires than oil, real estate, and even technology. The question is, are they creating value or just extracting it? These alternative investments used to be exactly that, alternatives. But the private equity market has changed in just a last 15 years from a small niche that was popular with a select few families to one of the biggest holders in the world. Because private equity is Private it can be hard to accurately estimate just how much capital is controlled by these firms. But a report published by the management consulting firm, McKinsey and Company, found that the Company estimated that it was over 13 Yes. $1,000,000,000 as of | 415.82998999999995 | 517.8706549999999 |

| SPEAKER_5 | I swear to god, like, I was down I was down my knees right here fucking blowing. And, like, | 480.4200299999999 | 541.040655 |

| SPEAKER_1 | No. | 490.6400299999999 | 490.96002999999996 |
| SPEAKER_6 | I don't I | 546.940655 | 547.9006549999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | don't smell it though. We probably farted. Like he did does Bartknocker. | 547.9006549999999 | 553.170655 |
| SPEAKER_4 | June of last year, given general market conditions and fundraising, it's likely to be even higher now. Now there is nothing actually that special about private equity. It really just means any investment made into a business or security that is not listed on public markets. So if you invest $1,000 in your brother's farmer's market stall, you are technically a private equity investor. So you know make sure to slap it on the LinkedIn profile. So the reason that private equity got so big so quickly has nothing to do with it being an amazing investment or anything silly like that. It's purely the result of a financial system that has become too concentrated. The American economy, finance, and business activity are all much bigger than they were in the 19 nineties. The number of publicly listed companies has actually gone way down since then. In fact, it's almost halved in the same time the economy has tripled inside. Now one big reason for there being less pumpkins to companies is simply because bigger companies have been acquiring smaller companies at record rates. Making for a more concentrated business environment with fewer companies overall. Which is, you know, the whole point of this video. But we will actually get to the consolidation later. There are also fewer companies IPO ing in the first place because there really is no need to anymore. Companies list themselves on stock exchanges to raise money from the public. Hence, why it's called an initial public offering. But the general public just doesn't have that much money anymore. Wealthiest 10% of Americans now own 93% of all publicly listed stocks. The vast majority of capital flowing into public stock markets comes from people or institutions. Institutions that are rich enough to invest in private equity. So the regulatory and report burden of being a public company just simply isn't worth it to get access to 90% of people who all collectively own just 7% of the market. That 93% of stock ownership is largely held through retirement accounts, which are handled by funds which can invest in a private equity as well. So for most companies, it just doesn't make sense to go public anymore. Now, alright. So what? People have slightly fewer options to their life savings into on Robinhood. Well, apart from that, this trend, which has only really been going on for 15 years at this point, is really causing a lot of problems and costing you a lot more than you realize. | 514.94003 | 702.060655 |
| SPEAKER_2 | After last month's massive solar flare added a 25th hour | 646.6700299999999 | 706.290655 |

| SPEAKER_4 | The first issue that doesn't get nearly enough attention is they have created micro monopolies. When you think of monopolies, you are probably going to think of giant companies that own entire markets everywhere across the world. Like, well, you know, shutdown. But a much more common type of monopoly has turned to become a bigger problem. These are small local monopolies. One of the hottest new private equity investments has become youth sports leagues. Little League is a great investment because firms can buy up all the sports in a local area and create a monopoly on competitive team activities. Nobody wants to be the parent that denies their child the opportunity to go and touch grass with their friends.

You know, the ones who want queers like me Let's go with erased. Not my wheelhouse. I'm not here to waste my time or energy. It's also not intended for the people who already politically align with me. No. That is my audience, and y'all are great. Thank you for continuing to come back. I appreciate it.

Who thinks censorship is the primary threat of the modern era and free speech is paramount. Who regard themselves as the average just the normal kind of person. Sentraist or 2 names of the problems with both sides. Now let's get to the J chase. I used to consider myself conservative liberal, libertarian, centrist, but have since moved away from all of those descriptors. I am now pretty far to the left. | 67.88000000000011 | 162.06072500000005 |

| SPEAKER_4 | very socialist that a lot of you have been taught to fear, and it's just me saying that you do I do consider closing this video right here and now Why? What about me saying is so threatening? Have run into this problem a lot when speaking with centrist and conservatives in particular. Something that I try to do often, I think we should be having these conversations with each other. I genuinely want to engage, and I've encountered a lot of people who will go off about the important of hard conversations and being able to understand this dream agreement while also simultaneously bending over backwards to try to dismiss me and missing from conversation. | 107.03990000000022 | 200.140625 |

And for many of you, certainly the ones that I have spoken with directly, I know that's what motivates you as well. So that's what I wanna focus on here. The areas where we're the same different. For the vast, vast majority of us, we have more in common with each other even through all of our identity. | 183.58000000000015 | 267.2605249999999 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Today, gonna be able to share with you some of what we be believed to be is planned as to why he conducted this attack. Now before we go on, I wanna just address a couple of things.

Nothing. | 420.519218 | 454.52922 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Listening to this We Listening to Hassan, I guess. Whatever the fuck this is. | 455.169218 | 460.659218 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I | 461.229218 | 461.729218 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't know what this is about. | 461.949218 | 463.489215 |
| SPEAKER_0 | What | 465.719215 | 465.799218 |

| SPEAKER_1 | No. They're they're they it didn't work. The stuff, like, is peeled I I think or we could just use fucking we could probably use no. It's not the it's not the paint that made it come off, though. It's just that stuff in general didn't stick, that orange stuff. It never, like, dried. Yeah. So, like, so we could probably just use the airbrush paint, honestly. | 553.3967180000001 | 574.8667180000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Oops. What | 578.596718 | 578.836715 |
| SPEAKER_2 | did you say? | 578.836715 | 580.216718 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Dilute that other stuff with, like, alcohol when it dry? | 581.436721 | 584.176718 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. Like, well, we could just try the airbrush. I mean, maybe it won't work, but I would think it might. Just try but we can dilute the airbrush paint for sure to make it less opaque. | 585.186718 | 594.566718 |
| SPEAKER_0 | That's | 595.726718 | 595.9167180000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | it to be No. | 538.3460930000001 | 540.1260910000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | To | 596.106716 | 596.2667150000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | make it less opaque. | 596.2667150000001 | 597.2467150000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Less opaque. | 541.8460930000001 | 598.226718 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. It has to be somewhat transparent. | 598.226718 | 599.9267150000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Passive | 600.3867180000001 | 600.4867180000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | has to be of a low percentile. | 545.066093 | 602.346718 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Not that low. I mean, that's not that low, honestly. But it is definitely opaque. I mean, it's it's definitely not, like, completely opaque. | 547.326093 | 611.1667180000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So this | 557.436088 | 614.806718 |
| SPEAKER_1 | yeah. | 559.3860930000001 | 559.5194230000001 |

| SPEAKER_1 | yeah. | 615.7667180000001 | 616.2667180000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I mean, I don't think that's the the | 616.8867220000001 | 618.4067180000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I | 618.6467180000001 | 618.7867180000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | alcohol, I don't think would make a difference really. I think that because it's epoxy pigment, like, it doesn't actually, like, dry. | 563.046089 | 625.9067180000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Oh, so that's just | 626.206718 | 626.7667180000001 |

| SPEAKER_2 | The factory still produce goods, extend production, | 0 | 59.44052499999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | and the value of those goods maintain the market price. In other words, facilitate exchange. But where it gets interesting is when these souls of color become radios. Also have a having as a factor of all the process of | 5.029899999999998 | 83.74052499999993 |

| SPEAKER_3 | as a factor of exchange destroys jury's process for very productive created. At the first symptom of the crisis, I don't melts away. It abandons exchange where it would still be found in dispense. And where it still exists, it appears ineffective and | 32.65989999999988 | 110.2805249999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | useless. | 54.859899999999925 | 55.359899999999925 |
| SPEAKER_3 | And thus, it reduces to a minimum. The consumption capacity of the market. People might look at the current crisis by a killer virus and think capitalism has been all sunshine and meadows up until this disaster period. But that would be naive. A crust occurred 14 years ago A crisis The tired Rosa mentions is, of course, the global financial crisis. The and how banks were lending out money to people and business businesses that had no way of paying back what they owed. The situation took over dramatic turn for the world. In mid September 2008, we the good performance of London Brothers. The 4th largest investment bank in the US. Confidence plunged. To concerns over counterparty exposure to London Brothers. For the major institutional failures have a fear of a systematic crisis. Banks were considerably less willing to lend to each other and global credit markets affected their profits. I've | 55.56989999999996 | 138.46980000000008 |

| SPEAKER_3 | virtually, let me and, dare I say, it's goes on to her second Rosa very dearly called them a cartel. Through the suppression of competition in a given branch of production, the distribution of the Masimo product, profits I was in such a manner that there is an increased share going to Such organizations in the field can Increase in one branch of industry at the expense of a number. Sure. By itself, these sorts of businesses that for how people actually stopped to consider the impact big corporations have on the economy? While a certain pandemic has been running its course, you don't see a lot of mom and pop shops around And this idea of companies as cartels gets even scarier when you consider the concept transnational It's our read's book. He states | 160 | 294.7605249999999 |

| SPEAKER_2 | TNCs from their earlier predecessors was the | 242.72990000000004 | 301.59052499999984 |
| SPEAKER_3 | fact that they no longer engaged in Just simple forms of internationalization. For example, exporting, producing, in branch plans for foreign markets involving 1 or 2 sides. Rather, they have been employing a diverse range of Israel nationalization licensing agreements, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and etcetera, which they have employed to develop global commodity chains. So chances are getting So TNCs aren't getting rid of the competition. Rosa, calls the tariffs, I called for trade agreement. This simple term socialize the losses, privatize the profits must have some historical foothold in our society. Otherwise, it wouldn't When you have lemons, | 301.59052499999984 | 432.23052499999994 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like lemonades. | 376.5399 | 433.58052499999985 |
| SPEAKER_3 | MRI couples, Now with these concepts of credit, cartels, and tariffs, still in the more important part do you get? A pretty foul broth, which ends up being a cycle of crisis. Financial crisis were pretty common for capitalists who were meddling in new industries. And Rosa very gladly pointed this out. Harley had Bernstein reject 19, 98, Marx's thesis of | 434.2805249999999 | 469.45052499999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | crisis. | 414.34989999999993 | 414.84989999999993 |
| SPEAKER_3 | When a profound general crisis broke out in 1900, while 7 years later, a new crisis beginning in the US hit the world market. The description of the cycle of modern capitalist industry as a 10 UPM period was to Marks and Engles in 18/60 and 18/17, only a simple state of facts. That were connected with the rapidly spreading activity of the young cap of young capitalists. This was a crisis cycle that after 2,008 you could definitely see that Martin Engles had a point. But what about Edward Bernstein and his contemporary who had aligned themselves with capitalism? These discussion points will be covered in part 2.

| SPEAKER_3 | Keep thinking. Keep running. Goodbye till next time. Hello, everyone. My name is Forrest, and welcome to my channel. This is a series of video essays where I cover political, economic, and revolutionary topics which are relevant to our | 477.5499 | 551.6305249999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | time. | 551.6305249999998 | 552.0205249999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I read the books, so you don't have to. In a world where money rules the land, there is one could take that is left unspoken. Integrity. Leads to innovation. | 496.59989999999993 | 565.8905249999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Innovation | 511.24 | 511.2799 |
| SPEAKER_3 | leads to inequity. Inequity leads to insanity. Join me as we explore the 4 eyes of capitalism. Now I turn need to remind anyone in Australia that we have a federal election coming up. It'll be the usual announce campaigning, and jot for marginal electric seats. But there's a line that's cropped up in political discord That has got me thinking. This line is something along the lines of Liberals and Labour are exactly the same. They're 2 sides of the same coin. Poor nationals. Everyone seems to forget about them. Oh, well, I guess they're too busy. After all, those cotton farms on the Mari Darling aren't going to allegedly water themselves. But all jokes aside, are Labour and Liberals exactly the same? So instead of pensioners worrying about franking credits they don't even have, for your weekend of not being killed by EVs, let's look into the facts, shall we? But first, I just came up. A disclaimer for this and future policy videos that I do channel. We all know that at the end of the day, politics should be about a contest of ideas. I fully respect people who look at the political party I go over today and say, they're not doing the thing I care about. Or they're not going far enough with the policy I care about. I hope there is I hope to present here a steel man argument of the party and to start a dialogue about what is good for the Australian people. I trust my subscribers are curious people and decide what they think is right or wrong at the end of the day. Having said that, let's jump right in. The Australian Labor Party or ALC for short are a party that came out of the trade union and corporate tradition. Which policy wise have added huge structural changes to the structural landscape. To those of you who don't know, when I say structural changes, I'm me. Specifically, a dramatic shift in a way and in Tree Old market functions, usually brought on by major economic developments. So golf weapon brought free university education. Mulholl brought in Medicare. Paul Keating floated the doll run and swan implemented the stimulus package in the GFC, which was praised by economists all over the globe. And Julia Gillard started the NDIS program. All of these were really important reforms of their time and had lasting implications for Australia as a nation. But I'm sure you're asking, that's all well and good. But that's what runs stood for. What does Alvo stand for? Well, depending on who you ask, especially ex in a time that desperately need structural reform. 1st cab off the rank, is aged care. To put things into perspective, the woke Commission into aged care, quality, and safety And a final report that came out in February 2020 one. And even in the chair's preface, you can tell that there is something desperately wrong, said Goll. There can be no doubt of the public importance of the Australian age care system for every Australian of every age. Nor can there be any doubt that a rogue can with the independence that it entails was needed to inquire into the quality and safety of the system. That in the interim report was described generally as besieged by neglect. This was a sector affected bit by bit by the Aged Care Act 1997. The privatization of Aged Care Facilities facilities reduced the quality of care. As Tim Cornell states, rather than adequate minimum quality standards, there were page and pages in the legislation about how government money would support the now privatized sector. What transpired was that the Howard government poured 1,000,000,000 into the industry largely losing transparency and control over the quality of care offered. But it doesn't stop there, of course. Neoliberalism does what it does best, It privatizes and attacks wages. This court caused aged care workers to be underpaid and be thrown into more precarious work situations. When beginning their career, the award rate for a full time aged care worker is $21.9 per hour. Slightly less than a cleaner. And only $1.25 per hour more than the | 511.59979999999996 | 915.6405249999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Australian | 915.6405249999998 | 916.1405249999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It goes without saying that aged care workers too much more than clean. The job is substantially more complex and demanding, both physically and emotionally. Okay. Well, what's labor's response? Labour has proposed that in order to improve the system, that aged care facilities will have to have a registered, qualified nurse on-site 247. That it would implement the findings of the work commission. For example, that there are more carriers in facilities, so elderly Australians receive and average of 215 minutes of care per day. Better food for an aged care residence, and of course a pay rise for aged care workers. The other huge element to come out of aged care is to establish transparency. And accountability in aged care. That's why Labour has committed to stronger penalties to protect elderly Australia. Feel free to stop the video and go over these screenshots I provide All these policies have a huge amount of detail. And it's worth exploring. The Aged Care Reform is expected to be an extra 2,500,000,000 Now before anyone cuts me off about a wrongly quoting cash rate, let's move on to the next policy, | 862.2999 | 1014.1705249999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Namely, | 959.2298999999996 | 959.6498999999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | health care. Again, it's a major election issue about the cost of living. And how prices for everyday commodities has gone up. But this was already the case and hasn't been an issue that has mysteriously cropped up in 2022. Alan Austin states that in 2021, The latest area of economic failure is the surge in the The Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that over the last year, costs rose overall by 3.85%. The highest since September 20 2008. The price of fruit increased 6%, beef up 13.5, medical services 6.7, Footwear, 4.9. Furniture, 5.9, and car fuel, 6.5%. It's for this reason that all families are feeling the pinch. So why should young families have to sacrifice incomes? Jason Roberts reported in January that childcare price the 3 months ended December 2021 across the metropolitan cities of Australia. Compared to the same period last year as COVID-nineteen impacts Sorry. Year, as COVID 19 impacts receded and providers returned to more historically consistent fee increase Labour's response to this has been a proposed to lift the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90% for families with their first child in care. That there is an increase in subsidies for a single child families earning less than 530 k joy play and expanding the subsidy to outside school hours care. The investment will be approximately 5,400,000,000 starting from July 2023. Speaking of rising costs, this topic goes hand in hand with what's going on with people's wages and salaries. Labor makes the claim that under the current government cost of living, has gone up by 3.5%. Alright. Whilst wages have only increased 2.3%. They say, picture tells a 1,000 words. And that's certainly the case with graphs from the ABS. Profits have skyrocketed from the period of the GFC to 2021. And, sure, a period of wage growth of 59% since 2000 8 looks impressive in isolation. Doesn't look so impressive when you take into consideration rate that profits have increased 92%. Personally, I think this puts Labour's cost of living claim in perspective. And that's just me, though. That job keeper. Sorry about that. Plus, we're not even taking into consideration the general unease of a skills gap emerging Australia Closed borders have added to the skill gap that Australia faced before the pandemic. The latest late motherfucker. Company directors sentiment index released on Thursday, shows labor shortages are a top economic challenge. Some 60% of directors nominated that skill shortages are followed by global economic uncertainty and climate change as important issues. Labor's plan is to fund up to 20,000 extra university places over 2022 and 2023 and provide access to 165,003 TAFE plate in nominated areas of skill shortages. Favory TAFE places in targeted areas will help build the industries hit hardest by pandemic. Like HOS hospitality and tourism, as well as meeting current and future needs in the care | 959.8898999999999 | 1276.3005249999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | economy. | 1276.3005249999999 | 1276.780525 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Including jobs in childcare, aged care, disability care, and nursing and community services. These announcements are further supplemented by 45,000 new take place The establishment of Jobs and Skills Australia, same job, same pay, legal protection, and a commitment to making wage theft illegal. This policy will be 1,200,000,000 to implement. Albo has made No. No secret. That he was raised by a single mom on a disability pension where lived in public housing. But the provider of this sort of service has been a staple for the Australian government. Providing moderately priced public or social housing has been a key government responsibility since the Reconstruction period following World War 1. Some administrations have achieved more than others. Few have failed as badly as the coalition from 2015 onwards. The Bureau of Statistics released data on housing starts in the private and public sectors from 1983 to September 2021. Bob Hoch's government build an average of 12,000 563 houses for low income Australians to rent or buy each of its 8 years. This collapsed to an appalling 4,399 per year through the hapless hour period when the rich did very nicely while the poor were neglected. The right government almost doubled that to 8,006100 and 15. And it has been downhill from there. As such, Labour plans to build 20,000 South Kelsey properties, supporting 20 1 point 5 k full time jobs per year or 1 in 10 direct workers on sites with, with apprentices. 4,000 homes for domestic and family violence sufferers and women on low income. Incomes. 10,000 affordable homes are for front line workers to live closer to where they will work will mean you know, better services for everyday Australians. This is followed by 200,000,000 for repair, maintenance, and improvements of housing in remote indigenous communities, a 100,000,000 free crisis domestic violence, transitional or common and older women on low incomes, and 30,000,000 to build housing and provide health specialists for homeless veterans. Quite honestly, there is a lot of detail in nail in the AOP His plan I could go further into | 1221.4398999999996 | 1455.6705249999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | manufacturing and be 15,000,000,000 National Reconstruction Fund where Labour may make | 1455.7305249999997 | 1405.0799 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the | 1461.060525 | 1461.5205249999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | case for commodities to be made again. The Powering Australia plan where later breaks down the specific investment they plan to do that is boosting renewables in the National Electricity market to 82%, upgrading the electricity grids to improve energy transmission a 3,000,000,000 dollar investment in green metal production, which has the lowest | 1461.5205249999997 | 1438.7098999999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | steel produced carbon | 1494.6905249999998 | 1495.6905249999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | footprint. Possible. And this sort of investment will hit the emissions reduction target of 43% by 2030 compared to 26 to 28% target of the coalition. Then there's, of course, the plan for John signing Medicare again. Where there will be a change to the rules, to allow regional and outer metro community to recoup more | 1439.8998 | 1524.0435249999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | doctors of their choosing. | 1524.0435249999998 | 1525.740525 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Including overseas GPs to help address a skill shortage. That is worsening in regional Australia. And also, the Ishamma And, of course, labor's plan to build to build up the NDIS again. And to screw up the cashless debit into your card. The latter issue I have actually covered before | 1470.2398999999998 | 1553.7307250000001 |

| SPEAKER_2 | I recommend you first watch my video on capitalism and crisis. This video is going to be a follow on from that video. Now evolutionary socialism concerns itself with reform. Within the democratic bourgeoisie political system. It looks towards reform rather than | 1614.1898999999996 | 1690.920625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | revolution. Working within the system, | 1690.920625 | 1695.1305249999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | rather than completely dismantling it and starting again The 2 main pillars of this were trade unions and cooperatives. However, Rosa Luxembourg has very distinct views about trade unions | 1639.9399999999998 | 1712.0205249999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | and cooperatives in her book Reform or Revolution. Mainly that | 1656.5999 | 1718.3805249999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | mainly that either these reformers organizations had no material effect on capitalism or that their inherent contribution would render the organization's structure meaningless. To break down what I just said, we'll go over this 1 by 1. | 1663.1597999999997 | 1738.4106249999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | First, let's discuss trade unions. | 1682.9998999999996 | 1741.720525 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Now trade unions during the turn of turn of 20 century had been the big players in helping workers get better labor, hours, and better pay. It's the use of Stripe that we can thank for all the working privileges we attest to today. But Rosa comments on the method with how trade unions go about challenging | 1686.7798999999998 | 1764.2107249999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | capitalist power. Trade unions enable the proletariat to utilize and | 1764.2107249999997 | 1772.600525 |
| SPEAKER_2 | at each instant the conjunctions of the market. But these conjunctures one, the labor demand determined by the state of production, to the | 1717.2598999999998 | 1786.7505249999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | labor supply created by the | 1786.7505249999997 | 1788.6905249999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | proletarianization of the middle strider of society and the natural rigor working classes. And 3, the momentary degree of productivity of labor. These remain outside of the sphere in trade unions. Triunions cannot suppress the law of wage. Under the most favorable circumstances, the best they can do is to impose on capitalist exploitation the normal limit of the of the moment. | 1733.0298999999998 | 1822.370325 |
| SPEAKER_3 | They have not, however, the power to suppress exploitation itself. | 1822.910525 | 1827.6505249999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Not even gradually. Sure. The trade union is quick strike and no one is disagreeing with the great achievement to get a fair day's wage for a fair day's work. But | 1772.5498999999998 | 1842.530525 |
| SPEAKER_3 | these were concessions that the capitalists were willing to make. A fair wage does nothing to change the system. And, ultimately, the trade unions wasn't they weren't seizing the means of production from the | 1786.5498999999998 | 1858.0705249999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | capitalists. | 1858.0705249999999 | 1858.5705249999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | A point to consider for sure The scope of trade unions is limited | 1804.4398999999996 | 1866.280525 |
| SPEAKER_2 | essentially to a struggle for an increase of wages and the reduction of labor time. | 1811.0398999999995 | 1872.850525 |
| SPEAKER_3 | That is to | 1817.3499 | 1873.810525 |
| SPEAKER_2 | say, 2 efforts at regulating capitalist quotation. But trade unions can in no way influence the process of production itself. Sure. The power of the tribe can improve your | 1873.810525 | 1889.410525 |
| SPEAKER_3 | wages today. But what happens if, say, April figure comes in that's sympathetic towards | 1833.8296999999995 | 1896.7705249999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | capitalists and decides to undermine your power. Rose's criticisms ended up being the demise of the trade | 1841.6698 | 1905.510525 |
| SPEAKER_3 | union movement. | 1849.5298999999998 | 1906.785525 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Well, in America at least. | 1851.3198999999997 | 1909.0005249999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's out of this context that you hear revolutionary socialists refer to trade unions and cooperatives as reactionary. | 1855.6096999999997 | 1920.1103249999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | As we explained before, trade unions at the total percent were only concerned with combating the long of wages. | 1865.8798999999997 | 1930.115525 |
| SPEAKER_3 | You can't really critique the system if you're too busy putting out fires. Or | 1875.0098999999998 | 1881.2198999999998 |

| SPEAKER_3 | But this group called themselves the Ku Klux Klan. They apparently derived the name from the Greek word from which we get circle in English. Clan was added for the sake of alliteration. Like you and your friends called yourselves the group gang according to historian Elaine Franz Parsons Ku Klux, the Birth of the Klan During Reconstruction, Frunt says that these boys weren't slack jawed gobos or hicks or red frat boys doing frat boy stuffs. Quote, even as he took some organized murder, comedy was central to the Klan's elaborate performance. The Reconstruction Klan wore a motley variety of costumes, and they wore costumes. Sometimes repurposed from parties. Not just ghosts and demons, but also moon men. The white uniforms didn't show up until later. They wore women's dresses for the same reason a lot of men do so. | 38.68000000000001 | 144.67062499999997 |

| SPEAKER_3 | You go with the people. What? Public of the party switch, which is what we're gonna talk about today. Mostly. The party switch is labeled a myth. Conspiracy, a lie cooked up by liberal academics after the fact says those who tell black people to let slavery go. It was a long time ago, they say. Trying to convince us that this country has changed so much since the civil war, let alone since the civil rights movement. The one thing that hasn't switched is the Democratic Party Now usually, this debate, discussion, and discourse about party realignment hovers around Jim Crow, the new deal, Brown versus the Board of Education, Richard Nixon, | 224.070625 | 265.020625 |

| SPEAKER_1 | C Squared parties ahead of the 1964 United States presidential election, saying that the Democratic party no longer represented people like him. Thurman supported Eisenhower and his administration and will go on to endorse Republican nominee Gary Goldwater, | 327.060394 | 397.071019 |

In his book from 1960 entitled The Conscience of a Conservative, Goldwater state in the integration with not states being forced deal. FDR was a democrat. He also couldn't stand fellow Republican Eisenhower or his policy He ran for president in 1964 as a Republican, versus Lyndon Johnson and managed to win 5 states in the South, which was unheard of for the GOP ad that Oh, weird. Weird how. | 381.650394 | 494.651019 |

| SPEAKER_5 | he | 538.311019 | 538.471019 |
| SPEAKER_1 | watched his adopted father march in a Klan parade and believed that the Klan defended the American way of life against race wishers and communist. By the 19 forties, Byrd recruited a 150 people to start a Ku Klux Klan checker in West Virginia. He even rose to the ranks of exalted cyclops, whatever that means. And at one point, said, | 538.471019 | 502.74039400000004 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Evaluated his left leaning positions for a mixed bag. He was a democrat, a US senator for over 51 years, still the longest serving US Senator of all time, and second among congress members, ever. He said that joining the KKK was the greatest mistake he ever made, but Quote, I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologize a 1000 times, and I don't mind apologizing over and over again. I can't erase what happened. Once Robert Byrd died in 2010, Joe Biden recounted that the former senator stood with him in the cold rain when Biden buried his wife and daughter. Byrd had lost a grandchild himself to a car accident in 1982. Around the time of his funeral, Biden, Barack Obama, the Clintons, and Republican politicians spoke well of Robert Byrd, yet these 3 are said to be the real racists for that. And now the GOP politicians. For doing the same thing. And look, I | 629.305032 | 686.315032 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is racist? Repugs or dems. But based on we've gone over already, If and Republicans Yeah. | 628.854409 | 691.475032 |

| SPEAKER_1 | It was a long time ago, but yeah, exactly. Member's super mad. Yep. Disgusting. You're fine. I can hear you. Just fine, actually. Yeah. It's like, well, who do they vote for? Who votes for Republicans? I mean, you don't see the Neo Nazis. Self proclaimed neo Nazis or or white supremacists voting | 738.2460289999999 | 934.536652 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Sold out. By embracing the | 1652.5486660000001 | 1710.789291 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, as | 1711.1092910000002 | 1711.989241 |
| SPEAKER_3 | if, like, | 1711.989241 | 1712.1492910000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | there's | 1712.1492910000002 | 1712.4692909999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | no | 1712.4692909999999 | 1712.629261 |
| SPEAKER_1 | legitimate reason for any use this term and like what they're trying what they're actually saying when they say it. As if there's no legitimate way to say that. That same thing. Is there not? I mean, I don't know. | 1712.629261 | 1728.519291 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Guessing the idea is a pure victim by supporting things like hard work, accountability, and low taxes, by refusing to think of yourself as a black person first as opposed to as an American who is black. Who said he | 1728.639331 | 1740.259291 |
| SPEAKER_6 | do | 1740.259291 | 1740.339291 |

| SPEAKER_3 | What'd you say? The only way I could operate as a human Why | 1743.2092910000001 | 1746.619251 |
| SPEAKER_6 | doesn't it say who these | 1746.619251 | 1747.579291 |
| SPEAKER_1 | people are? It should have, like, fucking, like, titles on the screen. Intelligence. | 1747.579291 | 1750.329331 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Those throughout. Oh, okay. When | 1750.949321 | 1753.829331 |
| SPEAKER_1 | they're introducing them. Yeah. Exactly. | 1753.829331 | 1755.6892910000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Okatam, has traditionally been a | 1700.5786659999999 | 1759.139291 |
| SPEAKER_6 | black person | 1703.418666 | 1760.569291 |
| SPEAKER_7 | that tried to serve and scurry favor of the white people. So they believe that | 1704.7586660000002 | 1765.489291 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Oh, wait. So is she so she just gave the definition. Right? Test with definition | 1765.739291 | 1770.2092910000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | of all | 1770.2092910000001 | 1770.7092910000001 |
| SPEAKER_6 | That's what | 1714.888626 | 1771.269291 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm saying. She just said. So they charge | 1771.269291 | 1772.949291 |
| SPEAKER_4 | okay. So | 1773.1092910000002 | 1773.509291 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that's what I'm saying. So that's the definition of uncle Tom. So what what they're saying basically is that there's no legitimate what reason way to say that this is like, to call somebody this. Or to there's no this this doesn't exist. Basically, is what they're saying. Right? | 1773.509291 | 1732.098706 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I guess I guess what they're saying is, like, | 1734.378616 | 1792.619251 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That there's no such thing. Less flat. | 1739.958666 | 1797.639291 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Essentially. | 1743.428666 | 1743.928666 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Wait. | 1800.289291 | 1800.689251 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Them? | 1800.689251 | 1801.189251 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, | 1745.5286660000002 | 1746.0286660000002 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Yeah. What's what's | 1746.268626 | 1803.369251 |
| SPEAKER_3 | their fucking | 1803.369251 | 1803.849291 |
| SPEAKER_4 | But no, | 1804.009291 | 1804.329291 |
| SPEAKER_1 | but I'm asking, but there's their their issue with the uncle Tom is like saying basically that, like, there's no legitimate way to use this use this term or any other term that means the same thing. I don't think I don't think kun means that. Though. No. Coon means It does not mean that was over. That just says racist fucking word. Yeah. That's that's not the same thing whatsoever. Like, and I don't yeah. That's that's completely different. Yeah. | 1804.329291 | 1773.1986160000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Because, like, calling somebody different, calling somebody in | 1829.179241 | 1832.229231 |
| SPEAKER_6 | alphabetical | 1832.229231 | 1832.3992910000002 |
| SPEAKER_8 | It's like | 1776.578626 | 1833.349291 |
| SPEAKER_6 | black | 1777.608666 | 1777.928666 |
| SPEAKER_8 | people | 1833.909291 | 1833.989291 |
| SPEAKER_6 | call other | 1833.989291 | 1835.029291 |
| SPEAKER_1 | other black people uncle Tom | 1835.029291 | 1836.309291 |
| SPEAKER_8 | Sam | 1836.309291 | 1836.4692909999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | mostly. Like, that's how that goes. Because, like, the | 1836.4692909999999 | 1839.1292910000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | what what black people mean by calling another black person uncle Tom | 1839.2092910000001 | 1843.3992910000002 |
| SPEAKER_8 | it's like you a fake ass nigga. | 1787.578626 | 1845.249291 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. | 1789.428666 | 1789.6687160000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You're a simil you're just assimilating. | 1845.649341 | 1847.1892910000001 |
| SPEAKER_6 | You're | 1847.249291 | 1847.409291 |
| SPEAKER_4 | not | 1847.409291 | 1847.649341 |
| SPEAKER_1 | even like yeah. | 1847.649341 | 1848.289291 |
| SPEAKER_4 | You're okay. | 1848.289291 | 1848.9592910000001 |
| SPEAKER_8 | You forgot where you came from. That's | 1793.138626 | 1850.639291 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. Exactly. So That sentiment | 1850.799291 | 1852.4992510000002 |
| SPEAKER_8 | is a if someone told me that I forgot where the fuck I came from, I I would be somewhat offended if there was any fucking truth to the to the statement. Well, | 1852.799291 | 1865.909291 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I think that in the in there's some context like you're not like I don't think anybody would call you that. I think selling out selling out people, | 1865.909291 | 1876.239291 |
| SPEAKER_6 | black people they asked negative by | 1876.239291 | 1877.839291 |
| SPEAKER_3 | black person before. | 1877.839291 | 1878.8792910000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, that's fine. But, | 1823.378666 | 1880.739291 |
| SPEAKER_8 | that's | 1827.1186659999998 | 1827.358666 |
| SPEAKER_1 | fine. But regardless, I mean, I'm not saying, like, every yeah. Just that's a different different | 1883.339291 | 1892.239291 |
| SPEAKER_6 | First | 1892.4992510000002 | 1892.699291 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, no. You didn't say you're fake. You just said I think that is even make sense, honestly, to say that. It's like, well, what do you mean? I'm not | 1838.248666 | 1900.159291 |
| SPEAKER_7 | fake. | 1900.159291 | 1900.4592910000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm not faking being black. I'm just black dude. What do you mean? | 1844.7986660000001 | 1903.679241 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Like, | 1849.378666 | 1849.538706 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that doesn't actually make sense, but, you know, I guess, like, I guess he was trying to say maybe. | 1905.519331 | 1910.7092910000001 |
| SPEAKER_8 | You're trying to say, like, I I am really | 1854.728666 | 1912.869251 |
| SPEAKER_6 | black. | 1912.869251 | 1913.369251 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Type shit. No. Well He was | 1858.0286660000002 | 1915.529291 |
| SPEAKER_8 | bringing my black No. I think | 1915.529291 | 1917.1892910000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | question. Well, maybe I don't know. Maybe you favor white people too much. | 1861.688666 | 1922.779291 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Or something. I don't know. It's what he was saying. I | 1867.038666 | 1925.339291 |
| SPEAKER_8 | mean, that's just that's just where I where I fit in. Like, I don't really fucking think like, racial, like, yeah. I tend to lean towards whiteness but | 1925.339291 | 1883.8686659999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Understood. | 1894.608666 | 1895.108666 |

| SPEAKER_3 | know. | 2238.386267 | 2238.886267 |
| SPEAKER_2 | In churches, in bars, on the streets, Americans have been celebrated as great landmark of civil rights. In Chicago, the veteran black leader, Jesse Jackson, broke down | 2186.505652 | 2253.436267 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Okay. | 2200.765642 | 2201.265642 |
| SPEAKER_0 | That's called Cyberburger. Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. | 2258.666267 | 2261.306267 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Was at Jesus. They always had that mentality. I could be anything, even God. For me, the image of him is like, he's the most powerful | 2318.0047809999996 | 2326.954781 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Does actually matter. Like of course, black people of course, black people are the people we see and being drug dealers He's considered like a god | 2424.14707698 | 2329.764781 |
| SPEAKER_0 | and basketball I mean, of course. Like, duh, you think they're gonna show white people being being drug dealers? No. That is that is the fucking like number one achievement of the fucking media is framing black people a certain way. With America, Even though they do drugs at the same rate and they are just and white people tend to sell drugs for that's the same. Yeah. The same rate. Like, | 2435.147077 | 2469.287077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | one way or the other. No. | 2470.597077 | 2472.517077 |
| SPEAKER_0 | It's the same yeah. It why? I don't I don't Yeah. I have nothing to do with doing drugs has nothing to do with race. | 2472.517077 | 2479.117077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. | 2479.697077 | 2480.197077 |
| SPEAKER_0 | that, like, I don't know. But yeah. And so so | 2423.936454 | 2484.577075 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that's the point. So that's just like y'all see y'all sell some of the drug dealers. Why? You know that white people sell drugs just as much, just as often, just as whatever. I don't know. What the word is. But they're just as likely to sell drugs | 2484.577075 | 2495.577077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | My fucking my parents bought me the fucking Washington toast. Like, the fucking where the head fucking, presidency or whatever. I had that hanging up in my wall. | 2449.656452 | 2517.307077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. I mean, I was it did it did, like, I think that it was like symbolic at the time and people had very good reason to be like, you know, proud of America for it, honestly. I think so. For sure. But Obama disappointed people and, like, very I'm just saying like, even black people, even the people who were sitting here, like, praising, you know, America for this, like, you know, they they were like, what the fuck? Like, this dude, he was know, he didn't do anything for us. Like, he wasn't like he was basically just another white president. And, like, And he committed fucking war crimes like no other, the same as any other. Like, and yeah. So sold out the poor over and over again. Like, | 2462.046452 | 2561.217077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Well, | 2509.216462 | 2509.296462 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that's every that's every but that's every president. So it's like it's just yeah. So I know, like, they're gonna sit here, which they're already doing, they're showing the most dramatic people from fucking whenever Barack Obama got elected. They're showing the most dramatic fucking people right now, but they're gonna say here, don't remember exactly what happens, but I feel like they're gonna stay here and be like, you know, they acted like it was a good thing and not like I don't know. He's just gonna pretend like people are still those same people aren't disappointed and | 2565.277087 | 2597.657077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like | 2597.657077 | 2597.7370769999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that they were happy with that kind of thing. | 2541.996462 | 2600.317077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I think that's, like, this little segment is the end of they're talking about Obama completely. But they have a | 2544.546452 | 2605.777077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | point in showing all of this. They just literally That's what I'm saying. | 2605.777077 | 2608.917087 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, they don't show, like, fucking what people think of them now. They just show | 2608.917087 | 2612.317077 |
| SPEAKER_0 | what | 2612.317077 | 2612.677087 |
| SPEAKER_1 | people I'm I'm saying what I'm I'm trying to say what I think that they're the point in them showing this is gonna be and it's gonna be that they're gonna frame the people who are all hysterical and all of the the being happy about it as being either not satisfied still even though we had a black president and, you know, like, look at all this commotion at how excited they were. That meant that we achieved progress. So what are people still complaining about? No. | 2612.677087 | 2578.526452 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 2634.507077 | 2634.907077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | know. | 2634.907077 | 2635.357077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What I'm saying is, like, after this segment, they don't Okay. | 2579.616452 | 2582.779792 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But what's at the end of this segment? It's not about Ogden. I'm talking about right now when they get whenever they make their point in this segment, The point that they're going to make is that people were so excited because we made progress. So what's the deal? They still not satisfied? Like we've already made progress. That's the point. Like, that's what I'm saying. Don't know. There's also more people in America, I think. Who | 2638.760417 | 2626.056452 |
| SPEAKER_3 | would have thought? | 2682.037077 | 2683.097077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | There's also I I don't know. Who knows? I don't know. I've not I've not heard that, honestly. | 2629.976452 | 2690.917057 |
| SPEAKER_3 | As the president of the United States, | 2635.576482 | 2693.737097 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But, Trump becoming president or the idea of him becoming president or whatever galvanize a lot of people to vote honestly. So I wouldn't I wouldn't put But I don't know. I would think the same for Obama because, a lot of people didn't want black person to be a president. | 2645.676452 | 2717.577077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Well, I could see. They said they said that, | 2718.037057 | 2720.357077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But Biden got more than Obama. Got more votes than Obama. I know. I know. What did I say that contradicts | 2666.996432 | 2727.997077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that? | 2728.137057 | 2728.457077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I was saying at first I said, like, I don't know. Whatever. There's more people in America, and then I said that then I was like, well, there were a lot more people that were galvanized to go and vote or whatever because of the idea that Trump might be president, so that's why there were so many more votes. But then I thought, well, that would it could kinda work with same way with Obama because there were a lot of people who didn't want a black president. So that's why that so I just basically like went back on what I said, like was | 2672.796452 | 2753.487097 |
| SPEAKER_0 | thinking | 2753.487097 | 2753.987097 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Oh, the point I made with saying that, Trump galvanized a lot of voters. I kind of, like, made like, | 2698.8464519999998 | 2706.176422 |
| SPEAKER_3 | it | 2762.2170770000002 | 2762.297077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | just kinda, like, yeah, applies to, like, not wanting is, like, the same thing. | 2762.297077 | 2767.497077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 2767.497077 | 2767.997077 |
| SPEAKER_4 | The camera crew. | 2712.206452 | 2768.827097 |
| SPEAKER_1 | In a way, except | 2768.827097 | 2769.707077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | one's just | 2769.707077 | 2770.0270769999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | more | 2770.0270769999997 | 2770.5270769999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | hateful. | 2770.747077 | 2771.247077 |
| SPEAKER_4 | The year prior I voted for Barack Obama, I was really passionate about Obama and his policies. | 2718.616452 | 2780.327077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | What was wrong with him? Conversation | 2725.056452 | 2782.417057 |
| SPEAKER_4 | with a friend, and I was telling him how, like, I'm a democrat because you know, the democrat policy is is pro Medicaid pro government benefits, all these things that can help know, poor urban communities. And does it in the bible. Say that we're supposed to look out for 4 people. And this friend of mine who's also a Christian said, | 2782.477057 | 2804.107077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | well, | 2749.086432 | 2749.406452 |
| SPEAKER_4 | was it talking about the government? | 2750.206452 | 2808.287077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The government is supposed to be of the people. Oh my | 2754.146452 | 2812.767077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | god. | 2812.767077 | 2813.267077 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And so I went back and read | 2757.976472 | 2815.317077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | it, | 2815.317077 | 2815.577077 |
| SPEAKER_4 | and it was talking about me, A lot of the way that I solved things began to change. But I was still a democrat. This friend has challenged me to go and read that republic platform and read the democrat platform and see where my values and my views line up. My whole mindset was | 2760.396422 | 2843.067057 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Tell me. | 2843.227057 | 2843.957077 |

| SPEAKER_2 | I have learned to go beyond | 2802.696452 | 2860.297077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Why didn't he tell us? What it was that he read that made him a republican and not democrat? He gave us specific policies from Obama that he like, but not anything having to do with the Republican | 2806.476452 | 2875.477077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | platform. | 2875.477077 | 2875.877077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Well, | 2875.877077 | 2876.197077 |

| SPEAKER_1 | and then just policies in general that helped, like, 4 people in And poor neighborhoods. I mean, that's pretty specific. He literally didn't say anything about their republican platform. But | 2825.526432 | 2838.5764520000002 |

| SPEAKER_1 | guessing that's not actual footage either. | 3215.1370269999998 | 3216.6403769999997 |
| SPEAKER_8 | People were the ones that had the greatest amount of experience. Success did not come in | 3216.747077 | 3223.807077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Who said | 3180.566452 | 3237.027047 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that? | 3237.027047 | 3237.527047 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I never saw myself as handicapped because I was flagged. I was a | 3208.896452 | 3268.7770769999997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | that I came from poverty. It's just not the way I process the world. | 3213.566452 | 3273.647077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | As someone who that is | 3219.096412 | 3276.7370769999998 |
| SPEAKER_8 | GED, went to a community college, | 3220.996452 | 3278.977077 |
| SPEAKER_9 | then went on to get a 4 year degree, graduated magna cummadi, while I was working 40 hours a week, nights in the weekends. At the community college library, My life is | 3223.316452 | 3294.0270769999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You see, you worked at the library. You could study a lot. | 3238.286452 | 3296.927127 |
| SPEAKER_3 | What do you mean? | 3250.676482 | 3307.477117 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Like, literally fucking disproves all that | 3265.1764519999997 | 3322.677077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | bullshit. Yeah. But also, she asked | 3322.677077 | 3324.517037 |
| SPEAKER_3 | them | 3324.517037 | 3324.7770769999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like she did all of this stuff and did all it was all success while working 40 hours a week. She was talking about graduating cum laude, her fucking that's where wherever it was. But yeah. But you worked at a library where you could study all day and be able to graduate from Kupada. That's | 3268.796452 | 3342.907077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that's still | 3342.907077 | 3343.807077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I I'm not saying it isn't. But what I'm saying is that like the opportunity for, like, people having to, like, work elsewhere and not be able to study to be able to, like, is the part is is like is the part she's acting like her working at a library made it impossible, made it difficult, like, like, what do you mean? That wasn't like it wasn't like | 3289.736452 | 3369.167077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | a | 3369.307077 | 3369.467107 |
| SPEAKER_1 | yeah. Or at least it's not like as much of a disadvantage for kids who are working fucking, like, McDonald's or something like that. And also, why are they pretending like like they haven't changed and become much harder for everyone everywhere? Like, what the fuck I'd be like, however it was back in the day | 3314.4264519999997 | 3384.5270769999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | towards black | 3384.847077 | 3385.247077 |
| SPEAKER_5 | people. | 3385.247077 | 3385.747077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | This documentary documentaries geared towards black | 3330.606422 | 3389.067027 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. Fine. Why is she acting like things aren't harder for black people today than they were back then, like, back then in, like, I'm not talking about wait. I'm talking about as far as, like, getting a job kind of shit. And, like, not people who have a job just getting a house. Whatever. I'm not talking about the racism. Course, racism. But | 3389.1470369999997 | 3353.066452 |
| SPEAKER_3 | in | 3409.047077 | 3409.207077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | general, it's harder for everyone anyways. This | 3409.207077 | 3412.087077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | experience | 3412.087077 | 3412.587077 |
| SPEAKER_9 | and a course of being | 3357.556452 | 3414.497077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, white people say the same thing to to white people talking about how, like, they they were they came from nothing or whatever. Their grandpa worked | 3414.577077 | 3423.497077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | real | 3423.497077 | 3423.657107 |
| SPEAKER_1 | hard and | 3423.657107 | 3423.977117 |
| SPEAKER_3 | did | 3423.977117 | 3424.307077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | or that. And they yeah. But it was much easier when your grandpa did it. I mean, that he practically probably got his fucking house for free. | 3368.326452 | 3431.627077 |
| SPEAKER_9 | There I learned that | 3381.006452 | 3438.2770769999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Why is she talking about handicapped squirrels? So that's a fucking, like, like, that's disingenuous as no other. She's | 3382.456452 | 3444.677077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | not saying anything like fucking, like, Like, handicapped, like, the like the mental retard or a fucking, | 3444.677077 | 3452.2770769999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But | 3397.326352 | 3397.726452 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. What | 3454.1070769999997 | 3454.426977 |
| SPEAKER_2 | is it? | 3454.426977 | 3454.906977 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Person. Okay. It's it's just handicap means she has a disability of some | 3455.306977 | 3458.9870769999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | sort. | 3458.9870769999998 | 3459.2370769999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like handicap Well, she's using it, like, in the in, like, a fight a fighting game. | 3403.496452 | 3464.017077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I know what a handicap is. | 3464.017077 | 3465.1370770000003 |
| SPEAKER_7 | They've | 3465.1370770000003 | 3465.557077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm not think but being black is not a handicap. But as far as, like, how It can't it can't | 3410.456552 | 3474.167077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | hinder the opportunities presented. | 3419.686352 | 3478.296977 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But | 3478.437077 | 3478.597077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that is not a handicap for that person. | 3478.597077 | 3480.676977 |
| SPEAKER_3 | This | 3480.676977 | 3480.9670770000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is a societal issue, not a black person's issue. Wait, what? | 3425.226452 | 3485.667077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It it is | 3430.566452 | 3487.267077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | it can be | 3487.507077 | 3488.8870770000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | A handicap is a legitimate thing. It's a legitimate, like, thing that's slows people down, you know, that is like a is something that's like a | 3433.326352 | 3498.4771769999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | legitimate | 3498.537077 | 3498.767077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a legitimate issue that people have in their own person that has the, has an effect on their performance. Or whatever it is. Their ability to just, like, live and go through, like, life without, like, needing some kind of like, whatever. This is not a thing black being black is not a hand societal thing that is the issue. So she says like that being black, she never have a handicap is dishonest because, like, it's it's a fucked up way to say like, say that because it's, like, no. You're right. Like, you shouldn't have gone through, like, anything as if you had a handicap. This is not a thing where we're saying like, you know, black people are just like, they have a handicap because they're black, like, no. The issue is society needs to fucking, like, like, She's | 3442.786452 | 3487.596552 |
| SPEAKER_2 | she's not saying that black people have a handicap She's just saying the fucking | 3543.717177 | 3548.4270770000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | k. | 3493.1214520000003 | 3493.426452 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It it is more difficult for a black person to fucking get ahead or get even even. | 3493.9865520000003 | 3559.9270770000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It | 3504.266452 | 3504.766452 |
| SPEAKER_2 | is | 3560.967177 | 3561.057077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | but it is because of society. She shouldn't have lived like she had a handicap. Like, she said she's saying, like, I never lived like I had a handicap. I never did this or that. Like, good. Nobody is telling anybody to do that. Nobody is even saying that black people have a handicap. They don't. It is society that has issue. Has an issue. It's systemic issues that, like, are the problem. Black people don't have a handicap because they're not a handicapped in any way. It's not like It's not. I don't I don't know. I mean, to say that she's not like being like disingenuous right here is, like, by using that word is is not thinking very critically about what she's saying. Or with | 3505.156452 | 3599.517077 |
| SPEAKER_9 | the accomplice, she's which was success. By then, it was too late. | 3599.517077 | 3604.437177 |
| SPEAKER_8 | When I was a kid, I went to summer camp in the area of | 3552.616452 | 3611.1770770000003 |
| SPEAKER_10 | California called Yukon. You call it flowers everywhere. It was a boy scout kamburine, and there were hundreds of boy Scouts from all over California. And from what I can tell, that we're just a handful of blacks. I was in heaven with maybe 7 or 8 kids. We've been together now for 3, 4 days. And there | 3555.436452 | 3634.257077 |
| SPEAKER_2 | was one kid. | 3634.257077 | 3635.397077 |
| SPEAKER_10 | He and I got some footwork And I literally had to restrain the other kids from killing this guy. I mean, they were just gonna kill him. Were more angry about it than I. And so I never really felt that those who are bigots, racist, were in the majority. I never really felt that. I always felt that. People who were bigots, intuitively, were in the minority and most people didn't That seemed to be consistent with my own personal experience. I was always confident I always know a good memory. And my parents gave me a lot of positive feedback because of that. I always know it's gonna be the cheaper. There was no doubt about that. The only doubt was the the route. There was never a time when I thought of myself as a victim. No. | 3635.4571770000002 | 3630.2365520000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But he wants | 3686.517077 | 3686.997077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you to think of yourself as a | 3686.997077 | 3688.1770770000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | They're just like making up things that, like, people like, the | 3632.9164520000004 | 3691.937177 |
| SPEAKER_3 | black | 3691.937177 | 3692.257077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | people say are real. | 3692.257077 | 3694.447177 |
| SPEAKER_8 | Is | 3638.8264520000002 | 3639.3264520000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | not | 3695.447177 | 3695.607177 |
| SPEAKER_8 | been caught | 3695.767077 | 3696.327177 |
| SPEAKER_10 | on video unleashing a racist rant alleged racist incident. Racial bias. Racist incidents. | 3696.327177 | 3701.247077 |

| SPEAKER_3 | racism, | 3702.7170770000002 | 3703.197077 |
| SPEAKER_4 | political protest, the open racism, | 3703.197077 | 3704.977077 |
| SPEAKER_10 | the | 3705.0369769999998 | 3705.5369769999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | open | 3651.786352 | 3651.866352 |
| SPEAKER_1 | racism. What? That is not oh my god. This is so dishonest. But this is so | 3707.846977 | 3713.1770770000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | dishonest. | 3713.1770770000003 | 3713.6770770000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | He's intercutting all | 3713.817177 | 3714.937177 |
| SPEAKER_3 | of | 3714.937177 | 3715.017077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | these, like, | 3715.017077 | 3715.7370769999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | these | 3715.7370769999998 | 3716.0270769999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | stories of, like, actual racism, but the only story he input so far where he's, like, where he's showing, like, the any like, where they show any kind of, | 3660.526452 | 3724.897077 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like, | 3724.897077 | 3725.307077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | substance of the story that people are saying is racist, is the one where it was not actually racist. It was a fucking idiot being | 3669.726552 | 3732.9670770000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | stupid. So | 3732.9670770000002 | 3733.447077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that's just so Absolutely. Yes. Like that's the only incident that they've shown any context for what they were saying was racist. And so they show that one, which is not actually a racist It was really fucking stupid. So that just makes people think that every one of these things that people are saying are racist issues on the news and stuff like that are false. They're not actually it's not actually racism. Like that's what that did. Like that's what the point in | 3733.447077 | 3754.017077 |
| SPEAKER_0 | that. | 3754.017077 | 3754.517077 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's a that's manipulation. | 3698.866452 | 3756.3870770000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | How do you get white people to | 3757.247077 | 3758.5270769999997 |

| SPEAKER_4 | I grew up being told, my disadvantage that | 3791.737177 | 3740.716452 |

| SPEAKER_7 | Is what is | 6528.6323760000005 | 6585.279701 |

| SPEAKER_1 | We we | 6662.3092167 | 6662.7092173 |
| SPEAKER_2 | wind it one more time. We wind it one more time and listen to what Obama says and tell me how that's not but that African Americans were were Africans were immigrants. | 6662.7092173 | 6673.419217000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I can't rewind it right now. And like, literally, what I'm try what I've been trying to say is that they have they were not saying the same exact thing. I've never even argued about, like, like whether or not what what Obama said literally I'm talking about the fact that they did not say the same thing. That is what you said. Was that they said the same thing? | 6674.379217000001 | 6698.7892170000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | They both said they're | 6698.7892170000005 | 6700.009217000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | immigrants. | 6700.149217 | 6700.649217 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's the same | 6701.259217000001 | 6702.379217000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | thing. It's I'm not talking literally we're not talking literally Remember? We already talked about They also didn't I okay. Exactly. So then that means that they also did not literally say it. Didn't say it in | 6702.379217000001 | 6713.549217000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | We are not talking | 6657.438592 | 6714.299217000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | about | 6714.299217000001 | 6714.4592170000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | literally. Okay? Can we agree on this? We're not talking about | 6714.4592170000005 | 6717.179219000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | literally. I'm I'm so fucking confused. | 6717.179219000001 | 6718.709214 |
| SPEAKER_2 | We are not talking | 6718.709214 | 6719.589217000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | about | 6719.589217000001 | 6719.7492170000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | them literally saying the same thing. Of course. They did not say the exact same thing. I am also saying they did not say the same thing with what they were like, implying or meaning in the at the time. Like they didn't say the same thing in any form or fashion. It doesn't matter literally or not. Is what I'm saying. | 6719.7492170000005 | 6739.569217 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Off of a local school over his ties, yes, to the president. | 6694.518592 | 6754.2092170000005 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I cringe when I've seen the way people like Dan Carson be treated by the media. Example, when Carson first became HUD secretary, he didn't speak with the like enslaved immigrants. | 6754.269217 | 6763.299217000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | A land of dreams and opportunity. There were other immigrants who came here at the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder, or less. | 6708.578592 | 6771.169217000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | So these are other immigrants came here. Okay. They they just came here on the bottom. They're not | 6718.428598 | 6779.339217000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | okay. They too had a train, and he | 6724.3985920000005 | 6782.699217 |
| SPEAKER_4 | got | 6782.699217 | 6782.979217 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Right. | 6726.998592 | 6727.498592 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Pride, especially in the black media. And we actually came | 6727.738592000001 | 6786.359217 |
| SPEAKER_1 | here on all the | 6786.359217 | 6786.439217 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's not why immigrants come here by the way, or that's not why the Like That's | 6786.599217 | 6791.489217 |
| SPEAKER_1 | not I know that. | 6791.489217 | 6793.069217 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Slaves | 6737.248592 | 6737.5685920000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | did not | 6793.549217000001 | 6793.7092170000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | come here because they had a dream. | 6793.7092170000005 | 6795.329217 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Lord. I'm good. | 6739.588592 | 6797.2492170000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That that that's what he just said. That's literally what he was saying. That's what he meant by it was that they had a dream too. That's why they came here. Because that's what he meant by calling them immigrants. That's | 6797.2492170000005 | 6753.388592 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like I'm arguing at. I'm lit all I fucking said | 6809.369217 | 6813.919217000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Like, I mean, either you agree with the what they're trying to say is the exact same thing. Basically, the Obama said 10 times, or you don't. | 6846.447515 | 6857.257515 |
| SPEAKER_0 | They were both making the same point. Do you think that? No. Like, really? I was Because | 6894.0427039999995 | 6906.4127045 |
| SPEAKER_1 | my my analysis my statement ended at immigrants. Like, you're you're in comparison with a set of fucking that it I would if Ben Carson was talking about fucking they did it voluntarily or what the I | 6907.152704 | 6920.862701999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | was just talking about what they said in the video. I was just talking about what Elliot whatever the fuck his name is. Said. That was the only point I cared about. I wouldn't I don't know why we would be talking about, like, like, specifics, like any like, very elder made it seem like the cook played a fucking whatever Ben Carson said was the exact same as what, Obama said at million times and he played a clip of what Obama said. In the clip of both people that he played, or that they played, they were not saying the same thing Uh-oh. | 6920.862701999999 | 6951.152704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | As it all, like, | 6952.6327009999995 | 6954.282704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | as they were trying to show it, babe. Like, what do you mean? | 6892.762079 | 6951.322704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Don't Like, I all that my you I'm not saying anything about what the fuck they're saying. I'm literally saying between you and me, you are looking at it deeper than I was looking at it. I was looking at it literally on the basis of them both saying that Africans were immigrants. That's it. That was the end of, like, my statement. That's all I was trying to say. So they did say | 6896.332076 | 6975.222704 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. But did you well, how was I supposed to know that? | 7049.78064 | 7052.31064 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Because I said it. | 7052.4706401 | 7053.60064 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. But then did you not understand what I was saying then the whole time? | 7053.84064 | 7057.81064 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I all I was trying to get you to do is understand what I was saying. | 7057.81064 | 7060.95064 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I know. But, obviously, I didn't because, it didn't make sense. So why didn't you just fucking, like, | 7061.11064 | 7067.56064 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the same thing right there, that Africans were immigrants. | 6919.642079 | 6978.602704 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I said, so many times that I wasn't talking about verbatim or anything like like any specific, like, thing that they said that was verbatim. I was talking about the point that they made because that was the point. | 7075.66064 | 7087.56064 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Understand that. | 7087.81064 | 7088.50064 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. | 7088.740643 | 7089.240643 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The only thing that I was saying was that I was fucking talking about what they literally said. Fine. | 7089.30064 | 7094.24064 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And they literally said there were no events. So then what does that mean exactly? | 7094.24064 | 7097.76064 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's as far as my thoughts thoughts on the subject went. Like, that's it. | 7097.82064 | 7104.16064 |
| SPEAKER_0 | So then you're, like, literally just pointing out they said the same words. I don't know. I don't I don't understand this. Like, about or what I've what I was even, like, | 7105.36064 | 7107.3906400000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | trying to debate to begin with or argue with it, Larry Elder was wrong. That was what I was saying the whole time. So why you would just, like, jump in and be like, they said the exact same thing or whatever it was. I don't know. | 7051.970015 | 7117.46064 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Oh, they did say the same thing. They said that they were both in they both said that they were immigrants. | 7167.810739 | 7171.670738999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | They did say the same thing, but they then they said 2 different things. | 7171.940739 | 7175.380738999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | We're not talking about when you say that somebody said the same thing, you're not talking about word for word. When you say that these 2 people said the same thing, you're not pointing you're not pointing at 2 people saying things that mean 2 different things. That is not when you say that. So that's like that doesn't make sense and I'm I think you understand that. I think you know that, that that's actually what people nobody says oh, they said the same thing. Whenever people were 2 talking about 2 different things. Whether or not they said the same | 7178.910738 | 7207.810739 |
| SPEAKER_1 | word | 7207.810739 | 7207.970738999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | said the same word. What's | 7208.610739 | 7209.490739 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the difference between saying something and meaning | 7209.490739 | 7211.460738999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | something. Exactly. So when do you point at 2 people and say they said the same | 7211.460738999999 | 7214.420738999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | thing? When they say the same thing. When | 7214.420738999999 | 7216.040738999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | they mean the same thing too. Right? You wouldn't say if people were, like, saying something that was that have different meanings. But they were just | 7216.040738999999 | 7226.170738999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | doesn't mean that they said 2 people | 7167.890114 | 7227.8507389999995 |
| SPEAKER_0 | and say that they said the same thing if they were saying different thing. If they were meaning different things. Right? I'm | 7227.8507389999995 | 7179.370113999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | not talking about what you would say, I'm asking what you would, like, when you wouldn't say. For sure, you wouldn't say | 7235.3507389999995 | 7240.1907439999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I wouldn't say they said the same thing. I'll say they meant different things. | 7240.270748999999 | 7243.450739 |
| SPEAKER_2 | If so I'm saying you would not understand somebody pointed out 2 people and said they said the same thing would understand is the meaning the same thing too. Right? | 7190.910113999999 | 7256.340749 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Not if they clearly meant 2 different things. | 7202.990113999999 | 7261.570739 |
| SPEAKER_2 | If so if somebody pointed at 2 people, 2 different people saying something or saying | 7206.150113999999 | 7266.830739 |
| SPEAKER_1 | 2 different here. | 7266.830739 | 7267.880738999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Uh-huh. And they said they said that they said | 7212.540113999999 | 7270.760738999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the same thing. Person came in and said that they said the same things I would have my own understanding that they meant 2 different things, but they used similar words. | 7270.760738999999 | 7279.480745 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So that so you think that | 7279.480745 | 7280.780739 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that's what | 7281.0807429999995 | 7281.120739 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Larry Elder meant when he said that | 7225.380109 | 7282.640732999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. I think that I'm not. Think that I'm not. | 7282.680734 | 7284.160739 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm not. | 7284.160739 | 7284.910739 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm not arguing against you. Because I agree with you. Okay? | 7229.600117999999 | 7233.940114 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. But I'm saying that he's doing it dishonestly. Is what I'm saying. | 7234.660113999999 | 7293.930734 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Agree with you. Oh, | 7294.090738999999 | 7240.450113999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | yeah. That's how you | 7296.430738999999 | 7297.150739 |

| SPEAKER_2 | I agree. I mean | 7243.540113999999 | 7300.000738999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm telling you right now that I agree with you. Okay? On the surface level, the way that I looked at it, they said the same thing. They used the same words. They've meant different things, they did not mean the same thing, | 7300.080739 | 7318.470738999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | that no slave came to this country willingly | 7292.780124 | 7295.910113999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This is one of the most atrocious acts | 7295.910113999999 | 7354.450739 |
| SPEAKER_5 | of historical revisionism that one might imagine Wasn't always easy for new immigrants. Certainly, it wasn't easy for Those had not come here voluntarily and yet in their own way, we're immigrants themselves. | 7298.950113999999 | 7376.010738999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | He's a lot older than you. I don't know. | 7434.528628 | 7436.618627999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | We can white people are more friendly than me. They were not made to be a They were made to be our enemies. Doesn't | 7436.778628 | 7448.188628 |

| SPEAKER_2 | the back It doesn't anecdotes | 7502.208627999999 | 7503.738628 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Well, anti | 0 | 56.80062500000008 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Capitalism is often celebrated as the apex of innovation and freedom. Yet this narrative falls apart under scrutiny. Innovation under capitalism is not driven by the desire to meet human needs but by the imperative to maximize profits for a small class of owners. This logic excludes 1,000,000,000 from the fruits of innovation, relegating their labor and lives to exploitation and precarity. While capitalism has generated technological advances, these are often achieved at great human and ecological cost. The exploitation of labor in global supply chains to environmental destruction, that threatens the future of humanity itself. Moreover, the claim that capitalism is non authoritarian ignores the violence embedded in its structure. The private ownership of the means of production gives an unaccountable minority power over the majority, creating deeply authoritarian workplaces and social relations. The coercion of unemployment, wage dependence, and debt are tools of control. While state violence from colonial conquest to police repression has always been deployed to secure capital's dominance. Efficiency too is a misleading term. Capitalism prioritizes short term profits over long term social and ecological sustainability. Generating obscene waste, planned obsolescence, surplus food destroyed amidst hunger, and resources funneled into luxury goods while basic needs go That The alternative is not authoritarian stagnation as the question suggests. But systems rooted in collective ownership and democratic planning. Socialism in its many forms which aim to organize production around human and ecological needs, not profit. History has already given us glimpses of such systems. From the economy of revolutionary Catalonia to Q1 health care and education achievements. Despite the weight of imperialist sanctions. True efficiency and innovation flourish when people collapse and justice. Not when they are driven by the desperate scramble for survival or by the dictates of a billionaire elite. Common pro capitalist arguments. 1, innovation and competition. Capitalism fosters innovation through competition. Anti capitalist opening statement, Capitalism is often celebrated as the apex of innovation and free production, gives an an obsolescence, sir, parent education achievements. Despite the weight of imperialist sanctions. True efficiency and innovation flourish when people collaborate freely, to build a society based on solidarity, fosters innovation, 2, efficiency. Capitalism allocates resources efficiently through market mechanism. Ensuring that supply meets demand. Alternatives like socialism lead to bureaucracy and inefficiency, seen in historical examples like the Soviet Union. Number 3, economic freedom. Capitalism is based on voluntary exchange, allowing individuals to pursue their own goals. It limits the power of the state over economic decisions, protecting personal freedom. 4, wealth creation. Capitalism has lifted 1,000,000 out of poverty. As seen in countries like China after market reforms. It generates unprecedented wealth, which can be redistributed through taxes to fund social programs. Bar 5, historical failures of socialism. Attempts to replace capitalism have led to authoritarianism, economic stagnation, and mass suffering. Examples like Venezuela and North Korea stem demonstrate socialism's inefficiency and cruelty. 6, environmental concerns addressed by markets. Capitalism incentivizes green innovation through market demand for sustainable products. Private property ensures accountability for environmental stewardship, 7, global integration and peace. Capitalist globalization has fostered trade and interdependence, reducing likelihood of large scale wars. 8, consumer choice. Capitalism provides unparalleled diversity in goods and services catering to a wide range of individual preferences. 9, workplace democracy alternatives are unrealistic. Attempts to democratize workplaces face practical challenges in management and coordination. 10, capitalism as a meritocracy. The system rewards hard work and innovation. Offering equal opportunity for success. Next step, choose 1 or more of these pro capitalist arguments you'd like to explore further. I'll help craft detailed anti capitalist rebuttals to practice logical progression and pro capitalist argument 1. Innovation and competition. Capitalism fosters innovation and competition, ensuring the best ideas succeed. Without the profit motive, people lack incentives to invent and improve. Historical examples like Silicon Valley highlight capital anti capitalist rebuttal, The notion that capitalism inherently fosters innovation is misleading. Because it conflates technological advancements with profit driven motives. Ignoring the conditions that make real innovation possible. Many of humanity's most transformative innovations like the Internet, antibiotics, and space exploration, originated in public funded research, not private markets. Silicon Valley itself depends on decades of state funded r and d such as the foundational technologies of computing and and the Internet, which were developed through government programs like DARPA. The profit motive nearly capitalizes on these advances to commercialize them. Often prioritizing short term profitability over meaningful progress. Furthermore, competition under capitalism frequently stifles innovation. Rather than encourages it. Corporations consolidate into monopolies or oligopolies. Using intellectual property laws, buyouts, and market dominance to suppress competitors and restricted dissemination of new technologies, planned obsolescence, hallmark of capitalist production, actively sabotages innovation by designing Under socialism or alternative systems of collective ownership, innovation can be directed towards social needs rather than market demands. Without the profit motive, resources could be allocated democratically to develop tech climate change, health care and equities, and housing crises. Rather catering to a weak speculative markets.

On the role of government in capitalism, 1, If governments are a barrier to free markets, why do corporations and wealthy elites invest so heavily in lobbying and contributions, and revolving your politics? 2, do you think government policies like bailouts for corporations or tax breaks for the wealthy, align more with the interests of ordinary people or powerful capitalists. 3, Can you think of examples where government intervention has benefited workers and consumers more than corporations? | 0 | 103.35064499999999 |

Who benefits most from these policies? 6. In a world where corporations wield massive economic and political influence, Do you think the absence of government would truly lead to a fairer system? Or would it simply allow the most powerful entities to dominate unchecked? 7, Is it possible that the government acts as a tool for the capitalist class, maintaining the system that benefits them while appearing to serve the public? On historical and contemporary evidence. 8. What role did government policies like land grants or military enforcement play in the accumulation of wealth by corporations and industrialists during the rise of capitalism. 9, during the 2000 8 fight, the person believes government intervention is why the market isn't working.

| SPEAKER_1 | ignores the potential for specialized participatory models of socialism such as worker cooperative, or direct democratic planning. Capitalism on the other hand, is authoritarian and passive. Often with little to no democratic accountability. This leads to the disenfranchisement of the majority of who must sell their labor to thereby limiting their freedom and autonomy. The reality is that under capitalism, the state often acts as and reinforcing the power dynamics that This is a form of authoritarianism that is not as But is, in fact, a system that denies genuine political and economic democracy. In socialist and communist framework, the goal is not to centralize power in a bureaucratic case but rather to redistribute power and resources ensuring that decisions are made collectively by the and not by a few individuals or corporations. The centralization of power in a capitalist economy, however, is far more entrenched. Pro capitalist argument. Centralized control limits personal freedom. In socialism or communism, the government controls the use of which restricts individual's ability to make independent economic decisions. Stifling innovation and personal autonomy. Government intervention, anti capitalist, brief response. The assertion that government control is inherently authoritarian misrepresents the nature of socialism and communism. While state control over the means of production is a key feature in certain forms of socialism, this does not equate to authoritarianism. In fact, socialism and communism aim to dismantle the centralized power structures inherent capitalism, promoting democratic over the economy and society of arts. The idea that centralizing the economy and enhanced people through democratic planning and collective ownership is imperative social movements such as workers, cooperative or direct democratic planning. Capitalism, On the other hand, it's authoritarian and inactive. Despite its ideological claims of individual freedom, In capitalist system, is concentrated in the hands of a few private individuals and corporations. In terms of labor production. Often with little to no democratic accountability. This leads the disenfranchisement of the majority of people. Anti capitalist response. The argument that socialism in pursuit of equality comes at the cost of liberty The freedom in a socialist is not simply the freedom to buy and sell commodities in a market. It is the freedom to have control over one's work, genuine on hot. By contrast, | 175.60997999999995 | 485.150575 |

The myth of a free market ignores the ways in which capitalism relies on For instance, this protects monopoly, austerity measures, austerity measures. The reality is that the market, free from regulation, would exacerbate a existing inequality, leading to further exploitation of labor. And complications Rather than viewing government intervention as a failure of the in capitalism is not a corrective measure, but a necessary component to ensure that capital accumulate in the hands of the few. Common pro capitalist arguments. Government intervention short market forces. The free market, when left alone, is believed to naturally regulate supply and demand. Interventions such as regulations or price driven by competition and profit motive will always outperform government run entities because they are incentivized to innovate Effective government oversight cycles innovation and entrepreneurship, creating a cycling environment for business growth. And individual freedom. The free market leads to optimal allocation of resources In the absence of government interference, the market will naturally allocate with minimal intervention allows individuals Government intervention results in higher taxes and greater public debt. Capitalists argue that government spending on social programs and regulatory enforcement and restricts private investments and economic growth. Once you choose a direction, we can dive deeper into repeating any of these points. The notes but to maximize profit for shareholders. Sectors ignores the reality that in many cases, the results in In sectors like health care, private businesses are incentivized to provide services the wealthy while the working class is less than inadequate or unaffordable options. Private sector efficiency often comes at the cost of a For example, when health insurance companies prioritize profits, they engage in process leaving millions without care. The same holds where private developers focus on building luxury properties, rather than affordable housing units for low income families. Programs while not perfect, our design prevents the use of the entire population not just the wealthy few. Public health care. Aim to provide equitable access to essential services regardless of one's income. Private sector cannot. And create a more Government programs can focus on achieving collective well-being social equity, and long term societal stability. Perpetuated by the private sector. The capitalist pursuit of profit inevitably leads to inefficient The same is that businesses driven by competition and profit motives are inherently more efficient than government programs. They argue that the profit motive incentivizes businesses through each path innovate, and deliver high quality services. With government run programs private companies to innovation. The Government programs uploaded and implemented. Critics argue that public services are In compact, private businesses are seen as more streamlined and better able to adapt to the needs of them. The government has no incentive to improve services. Without the pressure of competition and profit, public services may lack the motivation to improve quality and reduce costs. This is often used as an argument against government run health care education, | 6.440000000000055 | 488.485 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And that In reality, market competition does not necessarily progress or innovation that benefits vital needs, For example, in the tech sector, companies may raise to develop the latest smartphone with smartphone improvements. While neglecting essential areas like data privacy or equitable access technology. In process, we focus on innovation that truly benefits the public. Such as universal health care research, education for all, or sustainable energy solutions. Moreover, the reality of competition in a capitalist system Rather than a What I'm few large corporations dominated Public funding. Advancements that benefit society as a whole rather than a select few. Unlike private sector innovation, which is often Government driven innovation could be more inclusive and focused on being collective needs rather than maximizing individual wealth.

| SPEAKER_0 | Wait. What the fuck? What is that smell like? I didn't smell like that at all over there. Wait. What is it? I smell it. Like, hardcore. No. I know. But what like, what the fuck? It smells like the iron. Maybe? What is it? The toaster, no. Look at me. Is it the is it the heat? Wait. No. It's really it's we're just Wait. Hold on. It I think it sounds worse right here, but, like, not over here. What else could it be? Right? It doesn't smell like that in the room. So I thought it is it has to be the heater because every by every van, it smells like that. Right? Because the vent blowing out maybe this way is why it's tilted right here, and then in heater on fire? What the fuck? | 1561.1152229999998 | 1618.905223 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Turn the heat up. | 1566.244598 | 1623.425223 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You mean yeah. Like, off or not Is it not so on? I was just | 1623.425223 | 1628.9452279999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | saying turn it turn it up to see I because if it is on fire, if you turn it on, it's fucking smoke blow out. | 1628.9452279999998 | 1635.505223 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I Not not | 1581.844598 | 1638.5452229999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like extinguish, but, like, smoke would come out of the vents, and we'd know. | 1638.5452229999999 | 1642.235223 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 1586.4145979999998 | 1586.6545979999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | know, babe. I know. But also we'll know | 1642.635223 | 1644.2192229999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | it, I mean, either way, really. But it's it would say that. This would tell me, I think. So it's it was running just now. And it was only running for 2 minutes. | 1644.2192229999998 | 1654.005223 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So that's why we just started just started smelling it. | 1598.344598 | 1657.0852229999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But why have we never smelled it before? | 1601.824598 | 1659.705223 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Maybe it has something to do with | 1607.8646039999999 | 1665.705233 |
| SPEAKER_2 | what's AUX? | 1612.2045979999998 | 1669.165223 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Auxiliary. | 1613.9346039999998 | 1614.4346039999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Well, maybe it's something to do with that. Because it's let's see. | 1615.034602 | 1675.895217 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Right? Furnace furnace maintenance? Wait. Why? Oh, chain chain chain time to change their furnace. Thing, the filter thingy, whatever. Anyways, | 1638.4945979999998 | 1651.324598 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Never mind. I don't know. Does | 1655.064598 | 1712.415223 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It is coming from the fucking dent, though. | 1656.9145979999998 | 1714.975223 |

| SPEAKER_3 | mean, | 1726.375223 | 1726.695223 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it would be | 1726.695223 | 1727.495223 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I think I thought the heater might | 1727.5752229999998 | 1729.0952229999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | get | 1729.0952229999998 | 1729.445223 |
| SPEAKER_0 | be in there, or is it the same thing as AC unit? No. Because that's what always makes that words weird sound right? There? So that that would have been the heater recently. | 1673.544598 | 1737.8052229999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Did you buy that? | 1686.7145979999998 | 1743.8452129999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I don't know. Actually, now I'm pretty dumb, but I mean, I I think I mean, just make sure it's not on there. Don't know how this stuff works, so why it'd even be on fire? Thanks. | 1688.524598 | 1706.074598 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Testing movie, buddy. | 1711.3945879999999 | 1768.435223 |

And then then somebody then the subtext says, what's wrong with Scotch The nose and wind pipe might filter out some of it, but I don't know if if fine enough or if you're snorting a So I clicked on it thinking it might be related, but it wasn't at all related. It was just it was talking about somebody who did scratch offs and being addicted to it or something like that and then then the dot dot dot and the nose and whimper might filter out blah blah blah was related to, somebody snorting drugs and it had nothing to do with that. Like the 2 didn't at all. They're completely different points on the page. It's just that they're related.

So like, yeah, there's no way to like actually do anything with it that's like useful or even like events or things that I mentioned or, like, yeah. | 75.60173892974854 | 113.88061492974855 |
| SPEAKER_2 | yeah. | 95.95001006126404 | 96.22000006126405 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And that, Anna, also because I, am learning still learning how to code, and I it's cool and I like doing it and getting it to work. I | 97.74000000953674 | 163.92062500953674 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's just not fucking absolutely time consuming. | 113.88061499595642 | 116.54062499595642 |
| SPEAKER_1 | whatever I was doing was. I mean, I kinda told you it was just, like, making it more useful like, the information more useful, but I guess | 116.39999008178711 | 180.1406150817871 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the whole thing | 118.53062510490417 | 119.53062510490417 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. Is this fuck had a spot? Like, Cookie king. | 136.39000010490417 | 206.21062510490418 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I | 151.55999994277954 | 151.71999994277954 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yes. | 159.30999994277954 | 159.80999994277954 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I was I was just I was just I | 163.92062497138977 | 165.79062497138978 |
| SPEAKER_1 | know. | 165.79062509536743 | 166.29062509536743 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I don't know. I | 167.2306249141693 | 167.3106249141693 |
| SPEAKER_1 | know | 167.31062507629395 | 167.81062507629395 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you didn't mean anything | 167.8706250190735 | 168.59062501907349 |
| SPEAKER_0 | by it. You're just, like, wondering what the whole, like, purpose of | 168.59062504768372 | 171.98062504768373 |
| SPEAKER_00 | But i think that capitalism is a lot better than a centrally run economy. | 169.13903498649597 | 175.97903498649598 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Know, what would you define capitalism? | 179.13903498649597 | 180.99903498649599 |
| SPEAKER_0 | that didn't really mean very much. | 180.14061498641968 | 182.64061498641968 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Capitalism would be the ability to have private property ownership. | 180.9990348815918 | 185.2990348815918 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Okay, okay. i mean, | 185.29903507232666 | 188.37903507232667 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like I said, math? | 186.09001994132996 | 243.21062494133 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Just made | 187.57999992370605 | 244.36062492370607 |
| SPEAKER_00 | I would look at capitalism as defined as an economic system based on the allocation of resources. | 189.13903498649597 | 198.73903498649597 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Are based on a price mechanism. i think that's more of an accurate description of what capitalism is. yes, private property, but you can also operate with it | 199.13903498649597 | 208.99903498649599 |
| SPEAKER_1 | think I just read the person's name. It was Cookie King. Cookie king. | 207.70062494277954 | 213.46063494277954 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Capitalist economy without absolutely owning something. like, you could have a commune within a capitalist economy. you know what i'm saying? so... no, no. capitalism at its core. | 209.13903498649597 | 219.03903498649598 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yay, cousin Apple. Oh, fuck. I'm | 209.2400200366974 | 273.16062503669735 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Oh, fuck. I almost | 217.1800000667572 | 273.7106050667572 |
| SPEAKER_00 | There's just the ability to own private property and being able to own private property is the ability for privatized ownership over the means of production. that's all it is. | 219.13903498649597 | 227.95903498649596 |
| SPEAKER_0 | The guy who was circling around us kind of | 224.47000002861023 | 282.59062502861036 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What's he doing | 227.89000010490417 | 284.59062510490423 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Well, i definitely disagree. | 229.13903498649597 | 230.87903498649598 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Capitalism is an economic system where the allocation of resources are dictated by a price mechanism. | 230.87903499603271 | 238.5790349960327 |

| SPEAKER_2 | noise. No. | 245.16064500808716 | 198.28000000808711 |
| SPEAKER_00 | No, capitalism at its core is just the ability to own private property, and being able to own private property is the ability for privatized ownership over the means of production. that's all it is. | 249.13903498649597 | 259.01903498649597 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I feel kinda bad, actually. | 258.77999997138977 | 316.1406249713898 |
| SPEAKER_00 | I would look at capitalism as defined as an economic system based on where the allocation | 259.139034986496 | 268.939034986496 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Or resources are based on a price mechanism. i've got more of an accurate description of what capitalism is. yes, private property, but you can also... | 269.139034986496 | 278.879034986496 |

| SPEAKER_2 | And a best selling social scientist. This 800 page science book, for lack of a better word, maybe the most insidious book in the 20th century. It is impossible to overstate the influence of this book on promoting and inspiring some of the worst ideologies spreading around the world today. Yes, my friend. This image this image of sweet and kindly mainstream American Like our dads, but know, you could nicer. The calm demeanor and the intellectual heft. They mask the ugliest conclusions in science and in politics. But I'm certain that fans of this book will challenge me to prove his work wrong. They will say an ugly truth is still a truth. Right? Maybe I'm the one that should get out of my SJW hug box and read this work, address what he actually said. Only then can I speak against it with any sort of authority? Only then can I make an argument? Well, guess what, asshole? Challenge accepted. Let's talk about about the pill. The bell curve wasn't really supposed to be Murray's book. It was pitched as being the definitive work of Harvard professor Richard Hernstein. Who focused most of his career on the nature of human intelligence. Bernstein was something of a bit of a dinosaur in human circles even back in 1984. It was big teen nature guy on all of the nature versus nurture debates going on in academia. He published works back in the early seventies that gave a full hearing to genetic theories and intelligence. These theories along with others by similar scientists, were quickly considered antiquated out of mainstream field. Publication of Stephen j Gould's The Mismeasure of Man in 1981 basically nature for a generation of academic acceptance, leaving Harnstein on the outside of his own field in his own era. Introductory chapter of the bell curve highlights his frustration with this fact, along with naming several forebearers of his that Hearne believed were more on the correct path of scientific study, like Cal Berkeley professor Arthur Jensen. More on him later. For whatever reason, Herrnstein decided Now Murray was already a renowned political thinker and right. He was enthusiastically respected for the 1994 book losing ground, American 1950 to 1980. This book is the origin of many right wing talking points on social welfare programs and new era entitlements. It established much of the welfare queen mythos, the anti affirmative action assertions, and the dogmatic belief, the welfare makes people poor. I don't mean to suggest that he was considered out of the mainstream by any means. Even Bill Clinton complimented losing ground saying that Murray's theories would undoubtedly work in America. Fucking Bill Clinton. And this seems obvious to me that hernstein approached Murray as a co writer with the goal of shaping his data into prescriptive political RU He wanted the book to be a bestseller, and he wanted the book to find an audience with American concern. Political circles. He wanted to punch back against those that had shouted him down for decades. No one who reads the bell curve and understands it will come away from it assuming that it's just a book of blind science despite Murray's years of saying it shit. This book is not just meekly recording its numbers and assume nothing towards the conclusion you could make. Thanks to Murray and his political framework, the belt curve was not an obscure white paper of data charts. Thanks to Murray, the was an argument for change in the American social structure. And I want you to remember that throughout this entire video. The bell curve was published by Free Press, a non fiction imprint of Simon and Schuster, known in the eighties and the nineties for being the publisher of important right leaning pop philosophical some of which were some of the most pivotal works of right wing thought. Intellectual in the world or famous an entire issue of the New Republic is dedicated to touting into findings and arguments from this edited at the time by the blogging pioneer and gay rights activist, Andrew Sullow, | 202.46399999999994 | 523.4606249999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Is frequently cited by those on the right with the implications that lie within its pages. Are those implications? I guess we should talk about what's in the book. The bell curve intelligence and class structure in American life very quickly states its 6 assumptions. The first one is a bit obscure but crucial to understand. Number 1, | 491.49085 | 513.25085 |
| SPEAKER_0 | In 1990 Or mostly falling on the g factor side. But by no means is this or was it wholly a accepted. It's even more hotly rejected today. Did you factor is now considered an older tool for understanding human intelligence, a statistician to not a biologist's tool, and not a very useful tool really in any regard. But, again, this statement was uncontroversial at the time. Number 2, the g factor can be tested for with standard aptitude tests. But the IQ test is the best designed to garner statistics Number 3, what these IQ tests measure. Is what we generally classify as intelligence. Basically, the IQ tests are actually a good measure of one's cognitive ability and not one's ability to manipulate such tests by cheating or deploying some scheme. These assumptions will be addressed like Number 4, one's IQ score The | 547.159918 | 604.3199179999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'll let that sink in. Matter how much you learn in life, are still conscribed to the same cognitive lot you have been born in. Since you were a child. Number 5, properly administered IQ tests were not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups. This assumption is just the most dubious sounding sentence It brings us to the core problem. Fuck. Number 6, cognitive ability is substantially paritable. Apparently, no less than 40, but no more than 80%. Basically, you're as smart as your parents. Mercy. And that cognitive ability will be passed down to your your | 547.1992929999999 | 584.459303 |
| SPEAKER_0 | kids. | 640.439928 | 640.939928 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Mercy. Genetic heritage that is once birth, immutable and an escape Since as you can tell from reading the book that Murray and Hearnstein are more 80%ers than 40%ers. To them, you are basically all you are going to be from the formation of your brain in the womb. And, yes, this is one of those statements that sounds so idiotic. You're almost driven to believe it because what else but compelling evidence would ever drive someone to say something like But let's see what is driving Hearnstein and Murray to say In part 1, the authors look at how high education has changed the workforce based on the rise of IQ tests and other aptitude tests such as the SAT. American colleges changed from enrollments based on local legacies to meritocracy where all people with exceptional IQ scores gained x to exceptional education. This, in their minds, was a positive shift towards the country, abolishing the old class systems and turning our best students despite economic and regional barriers into our best workers and leaders. Much of this is irrefutable. It's a it's a great consequence of the 20th century. American colleges did change how we, as a country, viewed ourselves and our capability in the 20th century. Highly intelligent students in rural Kansas would have never gone to Harvard in the 19th century, but now they do. And surely this is a good thing. Then the authors start to make prescriptive extrapolations based on this data, and that's a problem. They use this case study. In 1971, the supreme court ruled in the case of Griggs versus Duke Power. Now Duke Power is a utility company in the Carolinas that had implemented a IQ test to all of its Straub applicants. Chief justice Warrenberger ruled that since This general IQ test had absolutely nothing to do with the job skills required for their position. I assumed pole climbing and, like, The only effect of such tests were to discriminate against those in the populace known to perform poorly on IQ tests. Diplomas and tests are useful service, Berger said in his judgment. But Congress has mandated the common sense proposition that they are not to become masters of reality. Went on to fight this practice to those of Literacy. Poll tests ruled unconstitutional by the Voting Rights Act. Murray and Hernsey see these IQ tests for job entry as a great thing, leading to even better productivity in society. According to their beliefs. The last video, I talked 10 common anti communist | 641.399923 | 792.679908 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Without further ado, let's get started. | 747.639293 | 806.159918 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Supply and demand. | 751.649293 | 808.769918 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Most demand is actually artificial, where people begging for someone to make a toy of a dog that poops plastic crap? Of course not. Ads are an example of how demand is artificial, which is the main way products are introduced to consumers. Basic needs like food, water, and shelter are some of the only ones who have real demand. Ironically, free markets are not even the solution. Industries like agriculture and meat are reliant on government subsidies to sustain in the markets. But the launching of capitalism, these crucial commodities, on enough to sustain farmers and corporations without the government. 9. | 753.4392929999999 | 792.359293 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Equilibrium. | 792.6792929999999 | 793.1792929999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What do you Adam Smith David Ricardo, and Karl Marx all have in common? They all believe that supply and demand is a sufficient theory of value. Basic economics says that equilibrium is the state in which market forces are balanced where current prices stabilize between an even supply and demand. It is true that supply and demand help make observations of other relation of value and price. But supply and demand rarely ever meet. When prices rise above values, investments are attracted and labor shifts to new sectors. When prices fall below value, labor is withdrawn from that sector. The bourgeois economic theory | 794.019293 | 889.229918 |
| SPEAKER_0 | What and how to desire commodities or to attain them to the market? With this, it is hard to even talk of an equilibrium price at any level of relevance. There is no justification to assume once the price is not at equilibrium, then it will ever converge to equilibrium. Prices only converge upon equilibrium under specific conditions the approach of mainstream economics is to ignore these fluctuation always an equilibrium. 8. Markets encourage freedom. I see an abundant market as a concept full of choices where everyone's needs are met, Yeah. Will simultaneously be compelled to feel stuck between competing pressures and search of meaning. This is because the market is in control of our lives. Don't believe me? Just try exiting the market. According to the origin of capitalism, British peasants were deprived of their access to land | 921.5948460000001 | 978.3348460000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | they were then forced to live in cities and offer their labor time or die. This is the case today. Where the majority of the working class are deprived of their abundant resources in a world that could cave to all, requiring one to work at the will | 921.754221 | 990.9948420000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | of a mayor who | 990.9948420000001 | 991.794846 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is compelled by all the incentives, including wage, 7. Despite very lines between small business owners and workers investing in stocks. Bunker. Often is maybe between those who need to participate in a wage labor | 991.794846 | 1013.0948460000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Black girl. Black girl. That girl. That girl. That's all. Bad girl. That girl. Back. Come here. Hey. Timsy. Go outside. Go outside. Go outside. Go outside. Go outside. Go outside. Outside. No go potty. Tip tipsy. Go outside. Come on. Go outside. Come on. Go | 977.3442210000001 | 1056.5242210000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | outside. | 1113.9248460000001 | 1114.4248460000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Bad | 1116.004846 | 1116.244856 |
| SPEAKER_1 | girl. And more people will want to save more to afford the more expensive things. It is a perpetual loop of constant wage, slavery, and constant capitalist accumulation while the economy gets closer to its collapse. While this definitely shows an inefficiency, it isn't exactly felt as much as as this next one. A thorough examination of this isn't even required. Many like to insult communist mocking starvation, famine, and bread lines. But if we assume deport If you've been getting scam texts like these, | 1116.244856 | 1205.324846 |
| SPEAKER_0 | means your data was probably leaked online somewhere. Most of you can | 1150.314221 | 1209.994846 |
| SPEAKER_3 | area of YouTube, the alt rights are running the show. Now I'm not saying the alt right runs Google, just yet. Any couple of hints of conspiracy on that one. However, the old rights conduct on YouTube has allowed them to take the political social common sphere we find ourselves in as their hostage and make it extremely difficult people to affect Silence opposition. Like Pub. However, we do know that there are Discord servers that actively have people vote | 1158.164221 | 1266.574846 |
| SPEAKER_2 | for | 1266.954816 | 1267.114826 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Hungry? | 1277.904221 | 1278.404221 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Now we know that there's might be also a this since there are rumors of English speakers doing similar stuff having been the original source of these tactics in the first place. So basically, the alt right are exploiting YouTube to affect the analytics of videos they like at this point, giving them an entirely artificial advantage and pushing their videos to more people and making video against them for the worse. Older writers also use their networks to mass flag content criticizing The shadow of these blinds leaves I've all anti alt right content creators like a dark | 1320.5242210000001 | 1418.634846 |

Here's your date of birth. Should be able to do that. If we can have a central registry. | 1526.234876 | 1543.314846 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Of rate services. It's just rare for them to be so public about their attentions. And since, like, 2016, they've been building their systems to pick up information on each. All Pride's Discord servers actively worked to find people's personal information. Here's an example | 1489.814221 | 1570.5848460000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | server, | 1515.684221 | 1516.184221 |
| SPEAKER_3 | trying to get the IP of a Twitter user to help find their real identity. The alt right leak account, though, is is connect to the same account, Gmail. The if so you would have to send a link to alt right league atgmail.com. Possibly. I'm trying to find out what the IPU is Trace email, trace email source. No. | 1516.584221 | 1552.654281 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The | 1553.8342710000002 | 1553.914221 |
| SPEAKER_3 | thing is that it's using the Gmail IP. I'm trying to ping the actual | 1609.8948460000001 | 1613.674876 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And as an update on that video, after my failed appeal, I contacted Trusted Flagler and he appealed the video too, also to no avail. So I have a strike on my channel for the next 3 months, so I can't livestream now. According to YouTube, criticizing harassment and bullying is somehow harassment and bullying. Gg YouTube, Grass anti alt right Discord server was infiltrated originally by Jean Francois but as it became more obvious he was a white nationalist, | 1687.006738 | 1725.346738 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Awesome. From record keeping to Germanica, who impersonated a scientist and tried to feed the server fake info on anti race realism stuff. That dumb operation mincemeat that was in the crowd serve of about a day and until to stop being stupid larpers. Well, the upright actually did that plan. The truth is behind closed doors, the p word became my secret sin age 10. | 1656.396116 | 1741.181738 |

| SPEAKER_1 | You talk about not feeling safe in your hometown. Well, I I am from Moderna, and we were shocked and disgusted by everything that happened. And was hard enough living in a town that had to deal with that. But then the following weekend, the EDM and other members of the far right came to our town. Where are you from? Sorry. I'm from Rotherham. Rotherham, | 1835.408969 | 1854.188969 |
| SPEAKER_0 | okay. Yeah. | 1854.188969 | 1854.908969 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. And members of the groups on houses. People who were Pakistani members of the EDL and these groups were smashing shop windows and cars. My dad was assaulted because he he was a Muslim taxi driver by members by men who identified themselves as members of these groups. And my question to you is that you talk about Muslim extremists as you should because it is a problem. I'm not denying that it is. But you don't mention attacks from members of the far right that attack other people or may members from the far right that go around thinking thinking it's acceptable to physically harm others. You focus on Muslims. You place the onus on Muslims. | 1854.908969 | 1895.328969 |
| SPEAKER_2 | This will be, like, the last thing. So you, you and Sargon have you know, we did talk about Sargon. You guys have a interesting sort of I don't even know what to call it. I mean, on almost like a because I've seen him shake oh, I think he commented on my video responding to your comment on my video about him that one time where he was doing that dumbass, like, the Democratic parties, like, the socialist party of America, shit or whatever. And then I've also seen him, like, comment on other videos He never disrespected you, to be fair. He just kinda said he disagreed with you. But, like, so, you know, what are your thoughts on Sargent and, you know, what the fuck is going on with him? Especially, Abby's running because I think they call it standing. They don't say running. I think they say standing for parlum. He's running for MEP, which is like I guess that's the your the EU part. And, just like, you know, what are your thoughts on the guy? He's not even claiming be left wing anymore because I think he took a political compass test, and now he's like, actually, like, in the right wing zone. | 1840.358344 | 1956.718969 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I was getting tired of waiting tables. I recently relocated to America. I feel like KUMA gives students great support. The people here work hard to make sure that our goals and dreams are realized. We get to do in judgments on each | 1903.448344 | 1972.808969 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Hi. I'm Robert Tolpe, and today we're talking about men with microphones. | 1973.028969 | 1976.5989789999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Pretty ironic considering I am in fact a man with a microphone. But we're talking about a very specific kind of man here. They're normally straight, dressed like they own a tech start up, and they constantly misogynistic way on their terrible podcast. And claimed to be experts at attracting women even though it's evident that they rarely ever come in contact with women at all. Highlights from the podcast these men host have gone wildly viral on TikTok in recent months, resulting in countless response videos from creators who aren't too happy with what these men have to say. In this video, I will be exploring the misogynistic world of male TikTok Podcasters and their awful takes. So buckle up and get ready for wild ride. Before I begin, I'd like to thank Atlas VPN for sponsoring this video. Right now, Atlas VPN is running a huge discount.

If you've been on TikTok for a while, you may have had the misfortune of coming across a little show called the Good Bro, Bad Bro, Pie cast. It's hosted by a man named Jack Denmo, who in my understanding was a popular prank YouTuber for a long while until he transitioned to the podcast scene. He claims to be able to help young men with their girl issues, but judging from the advice he gives on his podcast, after watching 1 or 2 of his videos, he began to get the feeling that Jack fundamentally misunderstands not only what motivates women in their relationship, but he also misunderstands the systems in place that prevent women from attaining the level of wealth and power that men attain. There is a set of fundamental principles that make up Jack's mind set regarding women that can be seen in each TikTok he makes. The main tenet of the female psyche, at least according to him, is that women require constant validation for men, which comes to them effortlessly via dating apps and the Internet. Tinder's a dating app for men. | 1921.108344 | 2102.758969 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But a validation app for women. So is Instagram? | 2047.198344 | 2106.398969 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. | 2106.538969 | 2107.038969 |
| SPEAKER_5 | And, like, when I tell girls I give, like, guys Tinder advice to, like, why would you need Tinder advice? Like, Tinder is so easy. Women need attention to validate | 2051.268344 | 2115.098969 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like plants need sunlight and water. | 2059.178344 | 2118.008969 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Is there any truth in these statements? Well, in one peer reviewed study of Tinder users that I found, published in the the likely to self report that they used the app for self validation when compared to men. The men in that same study reported that they use the app more for relationships and casual flings. So in some ways, Tinder is indeed a valid really depend on male validation and attention in the same way that women and water to survive? Of course not. Many men overestimate their importance in the lives of women. They believe that women do things to gain validation for men such as wearing nice outfits and carefully tending to their hair and makeup. But the reality is when a woman dresses in an elegant fashion, or spends 2 hours on her makeup, she's not always doing it for men. That would usually be a waste of time because most men don't appreciate the kind of effort beyond a certain sense. Do you know who does notice when a woman's makeup, hair, and nails are on point? Other women. That's right. Women desire female validation just as much and got more than male validation. This is not to say that there aren't women who do things exclusively for male validation to an unhealthy extent. We live in a deeply misogynist society where we are socialized to see a man's word as more objective and more valuable than a woman's words. Women can and do internalize that misogynistic thinking. Just check out this clip from another podcast where men shout into | 2118.008969 | 2213.888969 |
| SPEAKER_5 | microphones. Party girls, just immature women, attention is what are they? | 2213.948969 | 2217.738969 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Fentanyl. | 2162.638364 | 2163.138364 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So | 2219.178969 | 2219.418969 |
| SPEAKER_2 | just one | 2219.418969 | 2219.898969 |
| SPEAKER_5 | party. | 2219.898969 | 2220.398969 |
| SPEAKER_6 | And just want to see they just like the attention from guys, so we go out, dress all, hot and sexy. | 2165.398344 | 2227.888969 |
| SPEAKER_4 | This one woman's perspective is not at that women are somehow inherently dependent on men for validation. This just shows how pervasive stereotypes are and how they even even influence the thinking of the people that are being stereotyped. So if this idea that women need constant validation for men isn't always the case, why do men with microphones assume this is a simple fact of life? In my opinion, there is a great deal of projection involved. Here. These podcasts are centered around giving advice to men who desperately seek the attention of women. It's no wonder that these men think women constantly crave male attention because these men constantly crave female attention. This quickly turns into what seems to be rudimentary massage misogyny, but on a deeper level, it is rooted in envy of what they think life is like For women, | 2227.888969 | 2275.348969 |
| SPEAKER_5 | understand why girls post so many photos and stories on Instagram because it's so easy for them. They put a little thing on their story. Oh my god. Like food. Some guys were like, oh, that looks | 2219.528344 | 2284.928969 |
| SPEAKER_4 | good. In these guys' minds, that's what it's like being a woman on Instagram. Women apparently post stories simply to get unsolicited comments men. It doesn't even come across the podcaster's mind that maybe women don't even want these unsolicited comments and might be bothered by them, as many unsolicited DMs are hella creepy. But where is this misconception coming from? I think the reason why Jack thinks that this is what it's like being a woman is because it's what he desires in his life, posting a picture of his food on Instagram story and someone gives him positive attention. He envies that. Remember that Jack has the same misogynistic and inflammatory crap online just to get hate comments from women. He'd probably give anything, even just to get creepy messages because anything is better than posting something on your Instagram story and not even getting a single reaction at all.

| SPEAKER_1 | There's a high bar have to prove that government intervention into markets will almost never work. Even a modest centrist amount of pragmatism is enough to falsify hardcore libertarianism. So has to spend less time on cases where government works. And when he stumbles across one, just flatly misrepresents the sources he does use make it seem like it was a success of the free market, or he pivots blaming the government somehow. In this video, I'm going to spend some time on just one market failure, monopoly. Businesses with more revenues and profits can exert more influence over Is it true whether or not they're outright monopolies? Sol does write a fair amount about monopoly more so than most of the other examples, so it's a good choice to see how he handles market failures. Well, it's welcome that he does this. Once again, the writing can feel one-sided, tedious, and repetitive. You know how sometimes on campus you accidentally walk by a business and the professor is writing like profit equals revenue minus costs on the board? Everyone is taking those like it's actual school. Yeah. A cruise ship, for instance, must receive enough money from its passengers to cover not only such current costs as paying the crew, buying food, and using fuel, it must also be able to pay such overhead costs as the purchase price of the ship. And the expense of the headquarters of the cruise line This would be fine except that he writes out this kind of thing for almost every I almost died reading this book. Sol acknowledges that monopolies are a problem in principle. States that they would transfer resources to the monopolist through excess faced by consumers even more monopolies misallocate resources. When a monopoly charges a higher price than it could charge if it had competition, Consumers tend to buy less of the product than they would at a lower competitive price. In short, a monopolist produces less output than a competitive industry. Would produce with the same available resources technology, and cost conditions. I were to sum up Sol's argument about monopoly power, it's the private monopolies do exist, but they often short lived and always face competition. Even when a company seems dominant, they have to make sure they are working efficiently. Otherwise, they'll be displaced. This is illustrated by the high turnover among the top firms, which shows that the market economy just keeps getting rid of even the biggest firms once they've got the surplus. The businesses we hear about in the media and elsewhere are usually those which have succeeded. Especially those which have succeeded on a grand scale. Microsoft, Toyota, Sony, Boys of London Credit Suites. In an earlier era, Americans would have heard about the A&P grocery chain, once the largest retail chain in any field anywhere in the world. Its 15,000 stores in 1929 were more than that of any other retailer in America. The fact that A&P has now shrunk to a minute fraction of its former size and is virtually unknown suggests that industry and commerce are not static things, but dynamic processes in particular products, individual companies, and whole industries rise and fall, a result of relentless competition under ever changing conditions. There's some truth to this, but note those saying big companies will eventually be replaced. Isn't actually a direct defense of their behavior. As long as they are around and dominant, these companies can lead to problems for consumers, workers, governments, communities, and smaller businesses. In order to evade this obvious point, Solberg does a typical pivot to how it's all the government's fault. Fortunately, monopolies are very hard to maintain without laws to protect the monopolistic firms from competition. Ceaseless search of investors for the highest rates of return virtually ensured that such investments will flood into whatever segment of the economy is earning higher profits. Until the rates of profit in that segment driven down by the increased competition caused by that flood of investment. It is like water seeking its own level. But just as dams can prevent water from finding its own level, so government intervention can prevent a monopoly's profit rate, from being reduced by competition. We have entreated to a story of how monopolies were originally granted by the government through corporate law, something we'll discuss later, and how this continues today with license rules, which are a pet peeve of free market economists. This may all be true as it goes, but it runs directly into Jeffrey Friedman's objection. The problem for Sol how easy it is to demonstrate clear and significant cases where the non interventionist stance does not work. It's telling, for instance, that many of Charles' examples in these chapters are of consumer goods. He details cameras, television, supermarkets, planes, newspapers, cars, petrol, McDonald's, computers, and the like. I tend to agree that competition may triumph over the long term with goods and services that consumers buy regularly, where there are plenty of options, Where there are important areas where this is less relevant, like utilities or heavy industry. Sol again makes great hay out of the idea that consumers can substitute to other things if there's a monopoly in one market. But it's hard to substitute away from, say, a global logistics network. Anyone remember the cynic? In 2021, the Given container ship was launched in the Suez Canal in 6 long days, creating a massive queue which reached almost 400 ships by the time it got moving again. Multiple tugboats in to this the Ever Given, and one unlucky person actually died in the process. The cargo was going from Taiwan to the Netherlands, but it caused long lasting problems for ports and companies around world with the impact stretching as far as Sao Paulo in Brazil. The ship trapped in the canal was an almost too on the nose symbol of the general saw Oh, hey, guys. It's | 0 | 410.66060500000003 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Hello, everyone, and welcome to my | 533.801907 | 535.491908 |
| SPEAKER_1 | channel. | 535.491908 | 535.911908 |
| SPEAKER_2 | This video is about Thomas Sowell, who is an American economist. He's respected, and he has written quite a lot. No. I don't know why, but YouTube keeps recommending me these videos. Every time I see a new videos, I always get angry. So I thought that now I have a YouTube channel Let me make a video about this. Now video specifically has not much to do with Africa except when he speaks about colonialism. But mainly, this has to do with IQ, culture, and The last world war, you've got large numbers of of American troops remaining in Germany. For that matter, there's still several tens of 1,000 there today. And both black and white American soldiers had children with German women. And Fling discovered that those children growing up in Germany showed no IQ differences at all. For the the black kids, and the white kids, the same. Professor Flynn concluded that the reason was that the offspring of black soldiers in Germany grew | 536.151908 | 606.1119080000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | up | 606.1119080000001 | 606.191908 |
| SPEAKER_2 | in a nation with no black subculture. Close quote. Which means what? Which means they experienced exact expectations. | 606.191908 | 560.6212830000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Is this the thing? No. No. No. No. I I think it's the external. The culture in which they grew up with was was not the culture in which black kids grew up in America. | 617.1419080000001 | 624.821908 |
| SPEAKER_4 | So they had | 570.041283 | 626.741908 |
| SPEAKER_3 | no gangs around. Sometimes | 626.741908 | 573.4962830000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know if this guy is serious or not. But, you know, we have to address that point anyway. He's saying that in Germany, the children of the soldiers, regardless of their race, have the same IQ level. But when I look at this IQ difference, that is because of gangster rap. Oh. First week, there is gangster rap in Germany. It's quite popular, | 573.951283 | 651.971908 |
| SPEAKER_2 | actually. | 651.971908 | 652.471908 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And secondly, in America, majority of the gangster rap albums are sold to white kids. Thirdly, and most important, What are the factors are education and wealth. Now their parents, they were in the same place. | 596.771283 | 681.191908 |
| SPEAKER_3 | While this has to get better, | 647.2712730000001 | 704.8719080000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Are black people and white people in America, are they making as much money, and are they going to the same schools? And the answer | 649.341283 | 712.3719080000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | to that is absolutely | 712.3719080000001 | 713.8319180000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | In 2019, the median world of black household in the United States was 24,100 dollars compared that with 1 189,100 for white households. You understand the difference in wealth | 659.511283 | 733.901908 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I think I can leave fewer resources in schools, serving mostly whites How can they have the same IQ if they their schools are significantly lower standards. If they only get 12% of the wealth that this person has, How in the world can they have the same level of attitude. So saying that in Germany, they are the children of soldiers have the same IQ That proves that just shows that the problem is education and the problem is wealth. But this guy, he's for | 782.611427 | 824.641427 |
| SPEAKER_1 | education, he doesn't believe that government should promote redistribution or any other government programs. His point I don't understand even his point. He's basically saying that, well, that's my wife and people are the Sweeping | 767.480802 | 807.830812 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Sweeping claims for the benefits of demographic and cultural diversity have prevailed without a speck of evidence being asked for for | 808.360807 | 873.711417 |

| SPEAKER_0 | I do have a confession to make. Probably more than one. I suppose I haven't said anything about myself to make you lose interest. So let me just say a few things. Or at least I do have a confession to make. Probably more than one. I suppose I haven't said anything about myself to make you lose interest. All media instill norms and values that are antithetical to our best I view the world through a critical lens, and I advocate for others to think critically about the origins and purpose their beliefs. And whose who those ideas really serve. This is a source of any and this is, of course, a source of alienation for me. But also, I have nonnegotiables that make it understandably difficult to be with me. Sometimes even be around me. Genuine connection is necessary, though. I don't want to live a lie. And I find it frustratingly curious the ease at which people accept their ignorance and move through life. Moving with the flow and never questioning whether life could be about something else. I find myself isolated. I don't wanna be alone in that. It's nonnegotiable. fear mongering. And device the rhetoric on who the figure should be pointed to. Being conscious of who are being used as scapegoats and not something I'm what is something I'm willing to negotiate on. The typical scapegoats, of course, black and brown people, Muslims, Mexicans, immigrants who aren't white, transgender people, gay and lesbian people, feminists. Yes. Some are bad, but women generally. Punching down in humor slash comedy is not something I take lightly. The decency the the desensitization to such ideas about marginalized non conforming individuals othered, othered, and stereotyped individuals. Who differ from the dominant make it easy to overlook their suffering. This is probably the one subject that I have been able to I have been able to discern is when you believe we can we can agree to disagree on. I disagree. If harm can be demonstrated, the purpose shown to serve against our best interest in the lack of logic explained and proved with critical thought then no. There is no agreeing to disagree, only admitting an apathetic approach to keeping others from their liberation is a value. Punching up is where we find humor that brings people to their shared see their shared struggles and challenges. | 0 | 253.69669399999998 |

| SPEAKER_1 | I'd recommend them for anyone who has trouble with either or both those things. I used to pay them before sitting down to read a cow chapter of basic economics. But even though they greatly enhanced my focus, I still found solos books absolutely my money at times. And I'm used to reading about boring economic stuff. One of my favorite books is seeing, like, a State for Christo. Have you ever tried to read that book? It's boring, but amazing. So important in itself, studies and sources. I think I even spotted outright rep repetition a few times. We can see this most clearly with the first half of the call. To start, we get a discussion of what economics is and the role of prices in allocating scarce resources. Then we move on to how prices and markets work. Outlining the role of prices in our existing gas resources, we get a discussion of a | 0 | 61.41 |

But there is a vast of societies that include scarcity yet are not recognizable Australian aberration Who's that?

| SPEAKER_3 | She | 393.849056 | 394.009056 |
| SPEAKER_5 | is a dummy. She's standing in, like, just standing there. | 449.989681 | 452.489681 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Make up | 396.989056 | 454.389671 |
| SPEAKER_4 | what | 454.809671 | 455.04968099999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | we | 455.04968099999996 | 455.289681 |

| SPEAKER_2 | her. | 456.329681 | 456.619681 |
| SPEAKER_5 | That's what's going on. Worth pointing out. So She's deaf. Not like not like I thought where it's like account Unable to feel. | 400.959066 | 462.309671 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Realities. There's probably a lesson in there that will recur at some point. Remind you, | 462.389671 | 466.539681 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Restating or alluding to it. I'm not trying to make out that this alone invalidates everything he says, but it does give us a clue as to how to critique his understanding of economics. Let's do that with a simple case study. Alexander the Great. Is that right? Cool. One of the good things about the idea of social surplus is that it naturally adds historical specificity. By construction. We are not talking about civilizations that did not traditionally arose. Like the aboriginal. We are combining the application of economics to civilizations from ancient Sumer to Rome to contemporary capitalism. Still quite a wide range, but nowhere near as wide a soul. And the fact that this surplus changed over time is another instance of historical specificity. Sol's definition of economics causes him to flatter history in a way that is entirely up. | 502.159997 | 553.829997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But that's what we get the first time Alexander the Great is mentioned Maybe Sol's just hinting at something that he'll discuss in-depth later. When I started the grade began spending the captured treasures of That's the extent of Sol's proof that price increases in the modern USA follow the same laws as price increases in the Macedonian empire. You may notice that apart from the sentence long treatment of a hugely interesting it doesn't even make a comparative analysis. It doesn't even begin to demonstrate that the 2 periods followed similar pattern and he can't because he only said 40 words on the subject. Saul doesn't provide a site an ancient economics rabbit hole. And to be honest, it was pretty interesting. So thank you, Tom. The first thing that struck me was the enormous amount of uncertainty at the base among ancient historians. Mark Corrigan from Deep shows some of this are best with his book, Business Secrets of the Bearings. Well, Hello. 6 to 323 From what is now Greece? As far as India, In | 544.449378 | 650.869362 |
| SPEAKER_0 | that NBC | 706.849987 | 707.589997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | area, I would go. | 707.729997 | 708.789987 |
| SPEAKER_1 | There are a number of political and economic conditions notably the inflation results He seems to be alluding to the argument that as Alexander expanded east, he alluded a great deal Silver. Silver was used to meet the currency within the Macedonian Empire so such a massive expansion of silver This increased money supply would lead to higher prices of commodities as there was too much money chasing These diaries also contain astronomical observations precisely It's really cool, actually, that even with these toppings, | 657.029372 | 791.9599969999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | such numbers, | 774.8393719999999 | 831.829997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | must involve massive guests A | 775.8593719999999 | 779.519352 |
| SPEAKER_1 | solution empire in West Asia increased Babylon as well as the rest of Persia. Alexander the Great looted silver and other treasures from this area, though, whether he converted them into currency It is likely that there was a spike in inflation in the conquered town territories around this time and especially after Alexander's sudden death at 323 BC, the invasion appeared earlier in Seleucid before reportedly spreading back to Greece as So Lincoln drawing a causal line between the increase in silver and the scattered inflation across the empire is still a bit of a leap. I'll also state | 835.499977 | 869.429997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | a quantitative analysis of the source economy undertaken by KEGPERT rather than the release of Alexander's coinage, Who? | 813.789372 | 839.009372 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Or, | 841.0593719999999 | 841.1393519999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I mean, like, who is he quoting? He has? Okay. Yeah. | 897.1199770000001 | 905.7099969999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Sources I | 850.1993520000001 | 851.8893519999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | don't think you can you, like, paraphrase it or | 907.8699770000001 | 910.099997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 858.719372 | 859.0893719999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I think he she's just a | 873.049372 | 931.0499970000001 |
| SPEAKER_5 | random person that he knows, though. You know that. Right? He's not actually having the person, like, who he's talking about read this? Please. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah. No. No. No. No. He is somebody reading things that he's asked him to read. Like, said that they're That's not the scientist that actually No. | 875.939372 | 953.519997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Okay. Well, put them in. No. Years. | 897.979372 | 957.649997 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Wait. Why? It's just it's just create it's just to have, like, like somebody just to add, like, depth and understanding that he's it's a quote and not, | 957.9499969999999 | 967.519997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like like, | 967.519997 | 968.259997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | How? | 916.249392 | 916.5293919999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | We never got | 972.5100170000001 | 973.769997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it. | 973.989997 | 974.019997 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I'm pretty sure oh, fuck you. Oh, I'm pretty sure he's used the same voice for more | 918.199372 | 977.939997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I have haven't noticed that adding | 923.6493720000001 | 981.809977 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Yes. Oh, I mean I thought it I thought that He's not misleading. He doesn't say that this is them. He literally shows the quotes and then just has a voice reading | 926.079352 | 989.730017 |
| SPEAKER_4 | it. I I thought I thought the voice was the person that Well, I know, but | 990.109997 | 993.589997 |
| SPEAKER_5 | you're also not really listening. So you're don't know. I guess. Like, I'm pretty sure she was reading got like, this person, the quote that she was reading was a dude. | 993.589997 | 1003.0599970000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Even, | 948.519372 | 948.8993720000001 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Yeah. It's just to differentiate because they're long quotes between what he saying and whether or not it's still a quote. | 949.539372 | 1013.079997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. | 961.739372 | 961.979372 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Some ancient history isn't the best, but why are you so focused on this? Why don't you focus on the strongest points of the book? This one doesn't really matter, surely. First, we've got a long way to go, and they'll get their belief. We'll return to macroeconomics and inflation in part 2. There's gonna be a part 2. Let me turn to our highlighted is illustrative of the general outlook of Seoul | 963.469372 | 1040.769937 |
| SPEAKER_6 | and such life. | 1040.769937 | 1041.589947 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Often without sufficient understanding of the period they're studying, here's the full quote from the first time Soul mentions Alexander the Great. These basic principles of economics apply around the world and have applied over 1000 of years of recorded history. They apply in many very different kinds of economies. Capitalist, socialist, feudal, or whatever. And among a wide variety of peoples, cultures, and governments. Policies which led to rising price levels under Alexander the Great led to rising price levels in America. 1000 of years later, rent control laws have led to a very similar set of Hong Kong. Stockholm. Melbourne. And New York. So there's similar agricultural policies in India in the European Union country. What I hope to show you in this video is that economics is at a best when it acknowledges historical specificity. Thinking that we have laws which we can just apply to whatever time and place takes our fancy, is intellectually lazy and arrogant. Not understanding the details can lead to serious and avoidable errors. There may be tendencies, useful theories, and successful short term predictions in economics, but we should never mistake them for eternal laws. Throughout this video, I want to show you how Sol's understanding of economics falls apart if you actually take a good look. At the individual cases and their nuances, When I was 18, I applied for my first full time job. The application seemed like it was for an administrative position, but when I got there, they surprised us. It was door to door sales. | 991.1893419999999 | 1136.499997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Right. | 1081.1593719999998 | 1081.6593719999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I was one of those companies that praise on teenagers desperate for work by lying to the Anyway, I must have got the courage to tell | 1081.919372 | 1144.7599969999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | them | 1144.7599969999999 | 1145.000037 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I didn't want to do the job, found myself entering out into the suburbs I remember the salesman giving me a whole spiel about how the job would always make money because people would always buy cable TV. The thing we were selling. People will never turn around and say we don't want more channels and higher quality TV. They always want more. The salesman rabbit is on into my ears as I wondered how to get out of the situation I was in. In a way, he was right. TV consumption has only grown over time. And since the pandemic, hours watched has just bloom. We are watching more television than ever. Probably more than he imagined with unprecedented variety. In another way, he was wrong. TV has gone online, so cable TV doesn't even exist in the same way it did in 2010. There are that many people selling it door to door or really selling anything door to door these days. So that job has become obsolete, contrary to what the salesman Why am I telling you this 4 out of 10 story about my life? Because this random salesman's reasoning was better. Made me think more than Thomas Solesmith. In the previous section, we were discussing Sowell's definition of an economy and how he senses scarcity. Eagle eyed viewers will have noticed, however, that his definition of economic subject | 1145.000037 | 1215.069997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | has | 1215.069997 | 1215.349997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Another component which is how those scarce resources are allocated. Remember, economics is the science that studies human behavior as a relationship between and scarce resources which have alternative uses. How to allocate resources naturally brings up questions about who gets what. For soul. This leads us to think about what people desire how they'll use the limited money they have to fulfill those desires. What does scarce mean? It means of what everybody wants adds up to more than there is. This may seem like a simple thing, but its implications are often grossly misunderstood. Even by highly educated people. For example, | 1159.3693719999999 | 1252.479957 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Some material trash. For them, a rising income is the role to financial independence. Not to a home with a backyard pool. That is how a lot of people define their lives, by how much they have. | 1303.8674780000001 | 1315.747478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a feature article in the New York Times laid out the economic woes and worries of middle | 1196.859372 | 1257.239997 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Mister Brandyberry. I am not saying we are above that thing. We could've sworn. But we try not to let it be a conscious force. Try driving our lives. The article explicitly and vividly repeats the notion that their pool is a symbol of material after. It sounds like they didn't really want it. It's just that the house | 1316.057477 | 1335.217478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | they found in that area already had one. All they're aspiring to do is to own a house to gain financial security. Shelter is a basic need, hardly the best example of relentless pursuing superfluous material goods, especially because the article states that they are evangelical Christians who are actively trying not to be too materialistic. They even have something bird junk out of the pool to make use of $5,000 in the states. The pool was filled with couple the same way I feel terrible for someone taking littering garbage and garbage. Just a straight vibe. But given the passage I just showed is it not simply dishonest to summarize their situation as they say they're struggling, but they have a pool? When your concert may go bankrupt and fails to provide your family with a home, They're not just some spoiled middle class American Red and Bullen, honestly, this is actually a pretty interesting article. It contains a number of themes. The unfulfilled promises of middle class life in 19th America, how families struggle with this, basically. The challenges of having children for different types of families and how they resolve these puzzles themselves. For Sol, though, this is all fascinating to this article shows people always want more. Even when they have a swimming pool. Even though the article ends with somebody literally because I have This is Jones remembering driving with a was talking about remodeling and enlarging her kitchen. | 1335.457478 | 1456.687478 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And I thought to myself, isn't this big enough? It's plenty big now. Asked me a couple of months ago when were we going to upgrade our kitchen? And I said my kitchen was big enough. Somehow, | 1401.166843 | 1470.287478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | want more than they have. Even if it supported his interpretation, it wouldn't be enough. And if this is his reading of an article in the country that he lives in written at a time when he was alive, can only imagine how poor his comprehension of the Massimo | 1418.886853 | 1487.6174780000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | have hide what he's doing. | 1433.896853 | 1493.657478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm emphasizing this not just to point out how soul sources don't support him, although I am doing that and it will be but because it brings us to the idea of needs, people do go into debt for silly reasons. For sure, but most of the debt in the article is from people buying houses cars for transport. And things for their children. They're trying to attain what most people would regard as needs. Thomas sold not believe in me. No. Seriously. He has an entire section devoted to repeat one of the most common and certainly one of the most profound misconceptions of economics involves unmet need. Politicians journalists, and academicians are almost continuing to | 1437.836853 | 1535.987478 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Academic. Our unmet | 1536.547478 | 1537.427478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | needs are now society should be supplied by some government program or other. Most of these are things that most of us wish our society had more of. Is wrong with that? Let us go back to square 1. Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources which have alternative uses, then it follows that there will always be unmet | 1537.427478 | 1554.677478 |
| SPEAKER_3 | need. | 1554.677478 | 1554.927478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Some particular desires can be singled out and met a 100%. But that only means that other desires will be even more unfulfilled than they are now. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Did you spot that? Does the second paragraph switch from needs to desires? Halfway through, because you can't even pretend to your own brain that they're the same song. Let's read that | 1499.426853 | 1577.857478 |
| SPEAKER_3 | again. | 1577.857478 | 1578.157478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources which have alternative usage, then it follows that there will always be unmet Some particular desire can be singled out and met 100%, but that only means that other desires will be even more unfulfilled than they are now. If economics is about the allocation of scarce resources and people will always desire more, And remember, he didn't prove this with the New York Times article. The only source he used then it does not follow that need specifically will always be unmet. They may be an extinct category to wants, or to desires in Seoul's own words. He reinforces how weak his point is because rather than choosing examples of things people actually deem needs, Food. Health care, education, housing, constructs a thought experiment about of course, car parks. Anyone who has driven in most big cities will undoubtedly feel the there is an unmet need more parking | 1522.416853 | 1636.547508 |
| SPEAKER_3 | spaces. | 1636.687478 | 1636.797478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But while it is both economically and technologically possible build cities in such a way, as to have a parking space available for anyone who wants one anywhere in the city. At any hour of the day or night, does it follow that we should do it? Well, no. It doesn't, which is why nobody is calling for that. Transport is a need, but people usually call for transport in general. People need to get around to work for their social lives. For their freedom. So they don't need parking spaces. That's why there are campaigns to nationalize trains and make tickets free but not to nationalize and expand car parks. Oh, thanks, DSA. Did later disavow this tweet in favor of public transport. I've probably said I need my back scratched in the past, but that wasn't a political call for an army of human backscratchers. Or for the universal provision of plastic ones. Well, now that you mentioned it, up on the idea of needs, I think I can present the argument better than him. Consider the following proposition. First, needs are difficult to define. There are some blurry boundaries between a want and a need. 2nd, once defined, the necessary amount of a given need is equally hard to determine. 3rd, both the need and the amount of it will change over time and across Society. Does the 4th proposition follow? There is no such thing as a need. As distinct from a want. This is conceptually tricky. Much ink has been spilled trying to define me In on human needs, Kate Soper outlined some of the intellectual challenges. How can it | 1581.136853 | 1736.437458 |
| SPEAKER_2 | claim that the needs for which it speaks have that objective status that was deemed to distinguish If any statement of needs is a statement of value, and if any genuine statement of needs is made in acknowledgment of his normative character, then what distinguishes statements of need from statements of wants? But you know | 1736.437458 | 1756.687478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that people need food, and each person has some kind of necessary intake. Let's say in calories for the sake of simplicity. Some need different types of food to others, and some just have more in general. Men need to eat more calories than women on average. People eat more and have more varied diets now than in ancient Babylon. When they rely more on grains. So even this basic need has transformed overtime. Sometimes something we've seen superfluous is actually just the modern way to satisfy me. It's all well and good to admonish families for complaining when they have a big fridge, but else are they going to store the kind of food you can buy these days? Are they going to put it out in the snow like people did in the Middle Ages? On the other hand, is a big fridge really a need? My schoolmate used to have a fridge of legendary size filled with goodies. They didn't need that, although it definitely made them some friends. Would loot through their fridge in search of rockies and there in the dungeons, much like Alexander the Great through | 1701.106853 | 1755.2368529999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Persia. | 1811.217478 | 1811.717478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Needs may be tricky to define, moving from that to needs are impossible to define is a pretty clear example of softness creep, blurring lines and acting like nothing really means anything, man. Do you believe in God? And I think, okay. There's a couple of mysteries in that question. What do you mean do? What do you mean you? What do you mean believe? And what do you mean god? The boundary was | 1756.326853 | 1836.1274779999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | What the fuck? | 1836.287438 | 1837.267478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The boundary between tablet and laptop is not clear cut. Just look at this. I'm not gonna juggle it. The boundary between animal and | 1782.076853 | 1849.147478 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Ow. Is not clear. | 1849.174178 | 1850.207478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You ever seen a leap sheep? Because you should. They're photosynthesized, but they move around like slugs. Just look at them. We have foresight that tall people laptops, animals are Smith's concept? Of course not. This has been called the precisional fallacy. The precisional fallacy is often used polemically. For example, | 1794.7268530000001 | 1871.087478 |
| SPEAKER_3 | an | 1871.3875280000002 | 1871.547478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | apologist for slavery raised the question as to where precisely one draws the line between freedom and voluntary citing such examples as divorced husbands who must work to pay alimony. However fascinating these where do you draw the line questions may be, They frequently have no bearing at all on the issue at hand. Wherever you draw the line in regard to | 1871.547478 | 1890.3474780000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | freedom, | 1890.3474780000001 | 1890.8474780000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to any rational person, slavery is going to be on the other side of the line. On a spectrum where one color gradually blends into another, you cannot draw a line at all. But that in no way prevents us from telling red from blue. In the center of their respective regions. To argue that decisive distinctions necessarily require precision, is | 1835.086853 | 1854.2768529999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to commit the precision of phallus | 1910.257478 | 1912.187478 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You want to know who wrote that? Thomas Sol, acknowledged and deceased. If only he'd applied this to the domain between once and thee. People sometimes say that works in theory, but wouldn't work in practice. With needs, the idea is hard to define in theory, but easy to understand in practice. Most humans can rattle off a list of about 10 or so needs we have and we'll tend to agree on the broad categories even if the specifics are up for debate and change over time. The best way of illustrating this is through the idea of essential workers, which came up during the COVID lockdown. When lockdown hit, almost everyone understood immediate others were and author were not as important because they did not fulfill views of need. There was no room for sophistry when the pandemic hit. If you didn't provide us with food, shelter, transportation, entertainment, and so on, wasn't actively produced. Nonessential workers stayed at home for months. The boundaries were blurred There was debate over whether school teachers were essential, and they worked more during later lockdowns than earlier ones. Because people were more worried about missing a lot of school than a little. Nevertheless, there was a big class of jobs which fulfilled needs and a big class of jobs which did not. A given society at a given time will not have too much trouble splitting its workers into these essential and non essential categories. In case you weren't convinced that these don't exist, Sulfo The very word need arbitrage with some designs on the higher plane than others as categorically more important. But however, urgent it may seem to have a some food and some water, for example, order to sustain life itself. Nevertheless, beyond some point, both become not only unnecessary, but even counterproductive and dangerous. Widespread obesity among Americans shows that food has already reached that point, and anyone who has suffered the ravages of blood even if it is only a flooded basement, knows that water can reach that point as well. Ensure even the most urgently required things remain necessary only within a given range. We cannot live half an hour without oxygen, but even oxygen beyond some concentration level can promote the growth of cancer and has been known to make newborn babies blind for life. There is a reason why do not use oxygen tanks willy nilly. Yeah, man. You say you think health care is a need? Why don't we just give you all of the treatment in the world? All the antibiotics, anti acid, acids, laughing gas, heart surgery, dialysis, You wouldn't like that, would you? Not all at once. Therefore, health care isn't a need. Ben Shapiro apparently once said that Thomas Sol could defeat Thanos with logic. They officially I reckon Thanos would absolutely destroy him. The debate between these versus wants is age old and extremely interesting. But you're not gonna learn much about it from reading what you're saying. Now | 1856.286853 | 2086.587478 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Well, | 347.47997999999995 | 347.97997999999995 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Don't be crazy. | 349.08002 | 405.96062500000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I can see you, miss. Oh, great. What's that mean? Waleed. Oh, in what language? | 359.3399999999999 | 433.130625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Oh, | 379.135 | 379.49 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Excuse | 422.25 | 422.75 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you? | 478.790625 | 479.290625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 200 pound of pressure on that ass. Uh-huh. I'm a new car. Uh-huh. That's really good. Oh, | 443.77 | 511.120585 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Uh-uh. | 457.4 | 457.9 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Not be racist. Oh, | 554.695104 | 558.995104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So my question at that point would be how is having an actual language of black African vernacular is not racist then. | 559.635104 | 570.895104 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Is that a comparison between a dominant and then a not dominant? I'm just I'm | 572.255105 | 577.855104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | just | 577.855104 | 578.255105 |
| SPEAKER_0 | asking. How why name giving it a name, is it racist? You just gave it a name. It's just a name. It's it's What makes it? It's | 578.255105 | 584.515104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Just | 584.515104 | 585.015104 |
| SPEAKER_0 | African American Vernacular English is just the name of the of the language. What do you mean? So | 585.455104 | 591.975104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | if I'm to, like, tell a joke that, like, shows the difference | 592.480102 | 599.435104 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Between the white language and the okay. I can't I said I can't imagine a joke that isn't racist that compares the 2. | 599.995104 | 609.935104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Would you like to hear? | 610.345107 | 611.445104 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Sure. Go ahead. tried to say that just giving something a name was racist, I don't even, like, know what to say. | 612.805106 | 615.725104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Then expressing the difference between the 2 shouldn't be racist if | 562.004479 | 565.214479 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Exactly. So if that's your if that's literally how | 621.4351039999999 | 624.5550989999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you think about it That's the | 624.5550989999999 | 625.385104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the joke. The joke is the difference | 569.4044789999999 | 627.725094 |
| SPEAKER_2 | between fucking If you no. I'm | 627.865104 | 629.625099 |
| SPEAKER_0 | saying you just proved my | 629.625099 | 631.395104 |
| SPEAKER_2 | point. | 631.395104 | 631.7751039999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | By saying by sitting here acting as if it's the same exact thing just by giving something a name, | 575.7944789999999 | 637.715104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. Wait. You're you're missing you're missing why you're missing my argument. Like, I'm saying that so he was given a name. It's Different. Okay. Whatever. Mhmm. So showing an example of that difference isn't racist. That's my argument. Because if showing an | 583.394474 | 665.925109 |
| SPEAKER_0 | example Do | 665.925109 | 666.4051039999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you know what I said? | 666.4051039999999 | 667.1251139999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Because they're showing an example of the difference between African American vernacular and white American vernacular, if showing a difference is racist, then that means they're fucking either African American vernacular or white vernacular is racist. Because somebody else made the difference between the 2. So if I express that difference | 667.28511 | 691.755104 |
| SPEAKER_0 | It's not black American. | 636.334479 | 693.855104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But I said | 638.854479 | 695.635094 |
| SPEAKER_1 | African American vernacular. Yeah. | 695.635094 | 696.995104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I know. But you said white American. You did you did say black American a second ago. But do you know what I said? You did you remember what I said? I said that I can't imagine a joke that compares the 2 that is not racist. That's what I said. I can't. I literally cannot think of a way it would be not racist. | 696.995104 | 717.7751039999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So you the joke. A zebra confused his entire life on whether he's a black zebra with white stripes or a white zebra with black stripes. Dies and goes to heaven. And fucking at the pearly gates because, you know, zebras go to the same heaven as fucking He's talking to fucking Saint Peter. And fucking he's like, no. Pete, I I got a question. You know, like, fucking my black zebra with white or a white zebra with black stripes? Like, Never known. I've never known. Like, oh, yeah. You're gonna have to ask the big guy on this one. So fucking zebra's walking around Evan. And, you know, he runs into God. And this guy I have just one question. Like, I've fucking wondered this my entire life. Am I a black zebra with white stripes or a white zebra with black stripes? God responds, you are what you are. Okay? So he was walking around, having fucking just chewing on that. And fucking runs back into Peter. And he's like, dude, fucking, you gave me some of the most cryptic fucking answer ever. He said, you are what you are. He said, he was like, oh, shit. You're a white zebra with black stripes. What? Now what? How how did you know? He said, because if you were a black zebra with white stripes, he would've said, you is what you is. | 666.194489 | 808.615104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I don't get I mean, okay. Fine. That was, like, a neutral, but | 757.1644789999999 | 817.915124 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, exactly. That's not that's not it's not races. | 818.475124 | 821.1851039999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. It's not. Really? | 766.1344789999999 | 823.655084 |
| SPEAKER_1 | If | 768.054479 | 768.554479 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's not really | 768.7644789999999 | 825.465104 |
| SPEAKER_2 | unless | 825.465104 | 825.965104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you're you're like well, that's | 826.025104 | 827.385104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | just | 827.385104 | 827.625104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | because it was fun. Again, I could still imagine a racist sit telling that joke and saying that as if, like, there's something wrong with the black people the way that they talk. But it's not really | 827.625104 | 845.265124 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that how we all talk? | 789.594479 | 846.815104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's okay that they talk that way. It's okay that they talk | 791.074479 | 849.775104 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that | 849.775104 | 849.940104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | way. Though. There's nothing, like, wrong with it. So just saying it like that. Yeah. That's what they say. So What? Mean, that doesn't mean anything bad. But it's not a white zebra. With black stripes. It's just a striped | 849.940104 | 864.465104 |
| SPEAKER_0 | animal. | 809.0194789999999 | 809.494479 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But, I mean, I'm pretty sure it just says black stripes. | 810.374479 | 813.494479 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm pretty I'm pretty sure that they like, literally, like, compositionally just as black as they are | 869.855104 | 876.295104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | white. That's what | 876.295104 | 877.255104 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm saying. | 877.255104 | 877.575104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | What did I | 821.994479 | 878.385104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | say? What are the stripes then? | 878.385104 | 881.805104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Well, which is it where's the connected | 881.805104 | 883.4251039999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | part? They're all it's all connected. | 883.725124 | 886.525104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So the black the black thing the black lines connect with each other. There's no like | 830.894459 | 891.845104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | if you if you shave a zebra, those fucking the dark the dark lines, are in the skin. Why does that prove anything? | 836.294479 | 902.6051239999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Or did that help answer I don't know. Like, it's | 902.6051239999999 | 905.545104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | all connected, I guess. | 905.545104 | 906.9251039999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I'm talking about, like, the lines itself, like like, in the lines that there's I don't know. Fucking it's just a pattern. There's no in even looking at it like that, I guess. | 851.1344789999999 | 917.825124 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, | 917.965104 | 918.465104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I'm pretty sure not all zebras are created equally anyways. I mean, but they have black snouts. I think mostly. | 863.044479 | 929.325104 |
| SPEAKER_4 | They got white | 873.6444789999999 | 930.265124 |
| SPEAKER_1 | teeth. | 930.265124 | 930.765104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | That's everybody has white teeth. | 875.824479 | 934.1051239999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, you're born, you don't have to. | 907.894459 | 965.4950739999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. It's not. | 917.1444789999999 | 974.4051039999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Actually, it's not actually | 974.4051039999999 | 976.135104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I saw it at all. Only if you're dumb. I mean, I'm not saying it's not true, but, it's | 920.394459 | 930.474479 |
| SPEAKER_0 | still | 986.4551039999999 | 986.735104 |
| SPEAKER_4 | no. | 987.015104 | 987.515104 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's not. It's not because if we were thinking about what I said, being honest, it's not | 988.1351239999999 | 994.1751039999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Where's my map? I'm done with you. | 944.604479 | 1002.6051239999999 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. No. No. No. No. You said you didn't do the research or whatever? What? Because you asked you asked me when we were talking about it last time. You asked me if you if I wanted you to do some research on | 138.066324 | 152.466324 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it Oh my gosh. No dummy. No. That was but we just I decided to redesign or I sent it. It should be a thing where Well, it doesn't really matter because the other 2 are good too, and that you're just being in in this you could just filter out the one that we wouldn't have to be research on because we don't know anything about it. Right? | 152.466324 | 170.826324 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I thought well, I | 171.90632399999998 | 172.066324 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Fuck | 326.27999997138977 | 326.7599599713898 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I wanna get a supercharger for my Jeep. | 352.46003007888794 | 411.08062507888803 |
| SPEAKER_3 | A forced induction system. I've built this in force. Induction system. So, naturally aspirated engines just take air in as as called for, I think like, by the, systems training? | 358.5499999523163 | 438.48062495231636 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. | 382.6600000858307 | 383.1600000858307 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you. | 382.74058508872986 | 383.24058508872986 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Forced induction either turbocharger or supercharger. Actually uses external forces to fucking ram air into the fucking engine. Oh, | 384.2300000190735 | 451.28062501907345 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Alright. Good. Turbo charger. Uses, exhaust pressure to fucking pan a pan to suck air in. And then a supercharger is actually belt driven | 399.24000000953674 | 468.5406250095368 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You want the supercharger? | 411.08062505722046 | 412.0606250572205 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Okay. | 413.28004002571106 | 413.76000002571107 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But why would you need what does that do for you, I guess? | 425.4300000667572 | 483.90062506675713 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's it's it sucks a lot more air in so that whatever you know, your pistons are fucking compressing. It's the larger volume of air that's getting compressed in that same stroke. So that when that bucket heat is ignited, they're fucking commercial lot fucking bigger. | 428.0799698829651 | 503.2606248829651 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like what? | 448.1099998950958 | 504.8006248950959 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's like science. | 448.8199999332428 | 505.9606249332428 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Boom. | 450.539999961853 | 451.039999961853 |
| SPEAKER_2 | okay. So not, like, for your battery. No. Okay. | 451.2806251049042 | 454.0206251049042 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. Gotcha. | 454.0206251144409 | 454.60062511444096 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yes. I know what the fuck it's like. | 458.49000000953674 | 516.4106250095368 |
| SPEAKER_1 | A key little green guy. Steve | 464.17000007629395 | 466.840000076294 |

| SPEAKER_3 | So, like, it's a turbocharger is more powerful, but a supercharger is faster fast has a faster response. | 469.74062490463257 | 480.54057490463254 |
| SPEAKER_3 | 11/16. 1/16. | 476.53004002571106 | 479.16000002571104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It's like the biggest | 505.24000000953674 | 562.3706250095368 |

| SPEAKER_00 | To the edge of the bumper to where the hook went around, like the bolt went through like this, and the hook went | 7.894385099411011 | 16.35438509941101 |
| SPEAKER_00 | So like the bolt was in the fucking, in the bumper, like sticking out like this. and on the backside, it had that much thread in a nut. so like i hooked it. | 17.89438509941101 | 26.89438509941101 |

| SPEAKER_01 | Entire length. yeah. so that's | 45.85438513755798 | 47.47438513755798 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Not gonna fucking break not with that range but uh yeah it worked | 47.89438509941101 | 54.99438509941101 |
| SPEAKER_1 | guy had, like, 0 emotion. Actually, he's very monotonous. It's like nothing like he didn't even I don't know. He did say like he was very passionate in anything he was saying. | 47.92999505996704 | 113.49062005996703 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Yeah yeah | 54.99438500404358 | 56.77438500404358 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Right. Appealing to somebody's | 65.41999506950378 | 123.1006200695038 |
| SPEAKER_00 | I don't even know what the fuck i was looking at. but something just told me, like, look from underneath. i'm looking underneath and, like, i painted | 67.89438509941101 | 75.494385099411 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The debate debating based on emotions is is a losing for the debate. | 71.68062996864319 | 78.05061996864319 |
| SPEAKER_00 | The fucking motor mount blue. because everything that i replaced on that thing is blue on that fucking jeep. and i noticed | 77.89438509941101 | 86.83438509941101 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's wrong. That's absolutely wrong. But that guy wasn't even using emotion, honestly. He was just like like what he said, there was no emotions too whatsoever. He just said things and said them as if they were facts, and you're supposed to believe him just because he said them, in my opinion. With Tim Rice, I mean, I feel that he brought emotion, and that's what people need. We gotta that's human. To have emotion is human. | 78.05062007904053 | 102.49062007904053 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Well, there's a space between the blue and the fucking steel, so what happened there? | 87.89438509941101 | 95.31438509941101 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Yeah, i agree. | 97.89438509941101 | 97.89438509941101 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's | 103.11062002182007 | 103.61062002182007 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Because those holes are fucking made for this. | 113.89438509941101 | 116.47438509941101 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Oh, I I think you all misunderstood what I was | 114.99061989784241 | 117.46062989784241 |
| SPEAKER_1 | saying. Oh, sorry. What? | 117.46062994003296 | 118.68062994003296 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Essentially that purpose. so why the fuck is it not staying? like, i want to say it's because of the fucking misfire and | 117.89438509941101 | 127.51438509941102 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Like, all the vibration, but it's like, is it something, is there something else that, like, i'm just, like, not seeing | 127.89438509941101 | 131.094385099411 |
| SPEAKER_00 | That i'm completely fucking missing, that i'm completely like, oh yeah, i don't know that exists. an unknown unknown. | 137.894385099411 | 145.654385099411 |
| SPEAKER_00 | But but well never mind it's because the vibrations are mine | 147.894385099411 | 151.91438509941102 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of people sometimes have it wrong, especially when that's all that their ears are still with. There's wrong ideas about what we should care about. You know? Know? And so and, to my did make that point. He was just like he's like, I don't really care that we have to that you that you're saying that, oh, you know, the a majority of people, you know, we're just gonna put our trust in them. And the majority to do the right thing. And the fact that majority of these people like, I don't even know. It just didn't make any sense. Like, you know, he was, like, trying to get people to the door. | 157.31940603256226 | 242.67003103256226 |
| SPEAKER_0 | The other guy didn't say he feels anything, really. But, like, I don't feel like he feels emotion whatsoever. He just, like, acted as if he was speaking with what like, on logic. Like, then what he said was just logical. It's common sense. Like, I thought it was it was patronizing the way he spoke of the things he was saying because he's just like he said, isn't, like, this is common sense day. But, like, he's like and it's it was always backwards because instead of addressing my to my say, Tim Wiser address something, and then he would say the thing that Tim Wiser already addressed and, like, disprove. So I was like, wait. You you know he already addressed that. Right? Like, he already basically Are you not even Exactly. Or how he, like, made us appeal to the majority. Right? First of all, that's a mistake. We don't do that. Majority gets along all the time. Majority of people, that's the civil rights act was a bad idea. So I mean, the majority of people got segregation was a good idea. The majority of people were okay with slavery. So appealing to the majority is | 157.85003089904785 | 222.56003089904783 |
| SPEAKER_00 | I was about to say, like, well, what do people normally do about that? like, how do their bolts stay in? but it's the vibration that's not normal, so. | 157.894385099411 | 165.41438509941102 |
| SPEAKER_01 | I | 190.894385099411 | 191.07438509941102 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Psychology of fucking groups. Well, | 191.01940608024597 | 249.02003108024599 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Ran across my head. | 191.0743851661682 | 192.1743851661682 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like Group syncs. Yeah. But, like, that's the thing is that we if there's groups think it's, like, you're talking about that. Right? I think all of us are | 249.40003108978271 | 256.8900310897827 |
| SPEAKER_1 | what these people think just based on the fact that they said they're a Republican, and that's not good. That means they have no original plan. As in this | 251.56941604614258 | 315.1100310461426 |
| SPEAKER_3 | about | 257.1300311088562 | 257.61003110885616 |
| SPEAKER_2 | this. The psychology a mob. | 257.6100308895111 | 259.2400308895111 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. Exactly. Yes. Mob mentality. Yeah. Yeah. I get it, but, like, that's not I feel like that's totally ignoring the propaganda. The best of your told what to believe and what to think. And that, likely, the fact not believe anything with it. I I just or associate themselves with. | 259.3800311088562 | 283.69002610885616 |
| SPEAKER_1 | my my | 259.7793960571289 | 316.9000210571289 |
| SPEAKER_00 | But my question now is, | 265.894385099411 | 267.134385099411 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Do i fucking run to the fucking harbor freight? or... | 267.894385099411 | 274.55438509941104 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, | 283.6900260448456 | 284.1900260448456 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it's like like, people who just because I identify as being a republican or whatever, it goes with whatever the hardbo's kid. 10 years ago or something they believed. Even if they changed just because they didn't find work work out again, that's first. So anything else is just like, you already picked | 284.73003101348877 | 307.07003101348874 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Uh -huh | 287.894385099411 | 287.894385099411 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that, like like, I am saying that it is a tendency of, like, people who are who are republican to align with themselves, like, wholly with every I idea on the Republican side. Yours if you said to say it's too sides, meaning you're equalizing. That's iffy. The way the the way you the way you framed it made it | 300.849406003952 | 376.35003100395204 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the | 307.0700309276581 | 307.3100309276581 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Wally wally world | 312.894385099411 | 313.514385099411 |
| SPEAKER_3 | is | 315.1100308895111 | 315.3600308895111 |
| SPEAKER_3 | own | 317.3600308895111 | 317.4400308895111 |
| SPEAKER_1 | thinking. I mean, it's also true that the party are good. But to say the same are both equally publican. Like, it is the worst thing | 317.44003105163574 | 346.7400410516358 |
| SPEAKER_1 | much as they don't like this in the same way the republicans do. They don't. That's that's for sure. I mean, like, that's just like a a | 323.8994059562683 | 387.9900309562683 |
| SPEAKER_00 | What is christmas a celebration of? | 328.894385099411 | 331.11438509941104 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Jesus' birthday. | 331.11438512802124 | 333.77438512802127 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Okay. | 333.77438521385193 | 334.2343852138519 |
| SPEAKER_01 | No, it's actually the... | 334.2343850135803 | 336.0143850135803 |
| SPEAKER_2 | My statement have no quantity to it whatsoever. | 336.72940611839294 | 395.4500311183929 |
| SPEAKER_00 | It's not... technically fucking jesus was nine months old whenever fucking christmas happened. but... what... his actual history... | 337.894385099411 | 347.534385099411 |
| SPEAKER_2 | for all of us. That is | 346.74004101753235 | 348.14003101753235 |
| SPEAKER_00 | It's, uh, there's actual sign. it's, it coincides with the fucking winter solstice, which is the. | 347.894385099411 | 357.134385099411 |
| SPEAKER_3 | true of both | 348.14003109931946 | 348.7000310993194 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Shortest day of the year when the fucking three the three kings the three stars in the ryan's belt line up perfectly with the fucking pyramid but is | 357.894385099411 | 367.11438509941104 |
| SPEAKER_01 | That what | 367.11438512802124 | 367.4543851280212 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Actually celebrate it for? no. okay, yeah, i was like, but i'm saying like, what? | 367.894385099411 | 371.414385099411 |
| SPEAKER_01 | What actually happens at christmas time. okay, okay, okay. | 371.4143850803375 | 376.07438508033755 |
| SPEAKER_00 | I was like, but we celebrate it because they say | 376.0743851661682 | 377.7143851661682 |
| SPEAKER_2 | seem like the fucking democrats don't. | 376.35003089904785 | 378.1300308990479 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Like, common belief is that it's jesus' birthday. but jesus was born on march. | 377.894385099411 | 385.37438509941103 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But they don't. | 378.910031080246 | 379.48003108024596 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And | 379.48003101348877 | 379.8800310134888 |
| SPEAKER_01 | My mom. | 385.3743851184845 | 386.1143851184845 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Why? | 386.11438512802124 | 386.93438512802123 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Because i said, i said, yeah, sorry, it's just another day. plus, jesus don't celebrate my birthday. okay. | 387.894385099411 | 396.93438509941103 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. But but you I'm telling you though that it did by saying just | 395.6700210571289 | 401.6500310571289 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Baby, | 397.894385099411 | 400.694385099411 |
| SPEAKER_00 | I love you. that's fucking awesome. that is so fucking | 400.6943850517273 | 405.0743850517273 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that | 401.6500310897827 | 401.7300310897827 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it's true on both sides, basically. Because only reason why I was saying that, like, if you align with the republican side, you can already identify saying that they believe by that saying that they're republican or conservative because that's how the republican party operates today. All they do is instill fear about every every kind of issue and still fear, so you can already determine what people are believe believing because that's how the upper republican party operates. So you're I'm not saying that That | 401.73003101348877 | 435.7500310134888 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Awesome. i'm gonna fucking love you. | 405.0743851661682 | 407.79438516616824 |
| SPEAKER_00 | No. | 407.894385099411 | 408.074385099411 |
| SPEAKER_01 | No, but i usually do. that's awesome, babe. | 417.894385099411 | 418.974385099411 |
| SPEAKER_2 | doesn't | 435.7500309944153 | 435.99001099441523 |
| SPEAKER_3 | apply | 435.9900109767914 | 436.2400109767914 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to I | 436.2400109767914 | 382.6694259767914 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Okay, i'm going to need this. and these. | 437.894385099411 | 438.61438509941104 |
| SPEAKER_1 | did not say that. It doesn't that some people don't. But, like, what are the consistent beliefs on democrat of of the Democrats democrat party? They do not agree on almost anything. Are def different factions within the Democrat party that disagree on, like, plenty of things. That's what I'm saying. Like, there's no, like I mean, just saying that they believe in equality for all, yeah, sure. They can say that all day long, but they don't actually practice it as far as, like, the majority of them go whenever it comes to voting. So or that I mean, there's no like, there's no universal, like, stance on police. Policing, and it's like, like, need for reform or abolition. There's no, like, universal belief as far as war goes or the money we give to aid in proxy wars. | 438.65005111694336 | 492.2900311169434 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Talking about that's for santa liz okay | 467.894385099411 | 468.99438509941103 |
| SPEAKER_2 | trans. | 485.04940605163574 | 485.54940605163574 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 493.39003109931946 | 493.63003109931947 |
| SPEAKER_1 | mean, say, like, there if you meet somebody who says that they vote for democrats or whatever, there's no you can't say for sure whether or not they support the war in, like, support Ukraine. You don't know that. Like, there's a good chance you could be wrong. You know? But almost guaranteed, they will say that they support the Ukrainians against Russia because Russia bad. Now there are, | 493.6300311088562 | 521.5700311088561 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Now 787. what is now? | 518.894385099411 | 519.614385099411 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Wait. What? Like, I I I dis I disagree You | 519.7794060707092 | 526.2894060707092 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like | 521.5700309276581 | 521.7300009276581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, there are people | 521.8900110721588 | 523.1700110721589 |
| SPEAKER_2 | who, | 523.1700110435486 | 523.4900110435485 |
| SPEAKER_3 | in | 523.4900109767914 | 523.6500309767914 |
| SPEAKER_1 | general, are just like, no. We don't need need to be spending money in in in any of the war. I mean, we're not even a part of it, which is good, but, like, as far as, okay. Trans gender people go. If you're a republican, you are definitely anti | 523.6500310897827 | 540.1500310897827 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Deadlock stuff? | 527.894385099411 | 530.434385099411 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Yeah, for a .2 ounce tube. and then if | 530.434385061264 | 534.974385061264 |
| SPEAKER_01 | I get it shipped... | 534.9743850231171 | 537.4543850231171 |
| SPEAKER_00 | And wait for it to fucking show up, i can get a 50 -milliliter tube, which is, uh, how | 537.894385099411 | 547.354385099411 |
| SPEAKER_1 | If you're a democrat, you have no idea if they're gonna be anti trans or not. Just because if they say that they're democrat, they literally, you can't you can't predict whether or not they will say that they're, trans like, trans allies or if they're anti trans because it could literally be either | 542.1500310897827 | 502.4793860897827 |
| SPEAKER_00 | For it to fucking show up i can get a 50mm tube which is uh | 547.894385099411 | 552.634385099411 |
| SPEAKER_2 | one. And | 558.4600110054016 | 559.9000310054016 |
| SPEAKER_1 | whether or not they say that they're an anti trans because they, like, disagree with that lifestyle, it's a different story. They just don't that they're anti trans, but they are. But I'm sorry. We're always | 559.9000310897827 | 569.6600310897827 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. That's wrong, but okay. Okay. And if you're a pumpkin, this okay. This one's a tricky one, I guess, in a way because republicans lie in they say that they're all for taxing the rich and be, like, taking money away from the elite, but that's not true. | 566.1494059562683 | 637.9200309562683 |
| SPEAKER_00 | So 6 milliliters is one -fifth of an ounce. that means an ounce would be 30 milliliters. | 568.894385099411 | 577.294385099411 |
| SPEAKER_00 | So yeah, i can get basically like seven times that much. | 577.894385099411 | 580.054385099411 |
| SPEAKER_1 | disagree? | 582.2700309753418 | 582.7500309753418 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm not I'm not, like, trying to, like I'm not taking sides or defend off. I don't think it's and dry like you're like like you're I can hear | 582.7500309944153 | 592.7200309944152 |
| SPEAKER_0 | So whether or not they're, like, actually aware of what their Republican party does is a different story. So I guess that one was. | 582.8194060325623 | 645.0400310325623 |
| SPEAKER_00 | For fucking $2 more, $3 more. | 587.894385099411 | 591.694385099411 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Tricky. Okay. So how about this? Health care for all. Free health care. | 589.3394060134888 | 649.5400010134888 |
| SPEAKER_01 | And that's from where? and that's from where? from | 591.6943850517273 | 595.8343850517273 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you. I didn't make a cut, sir. I what do you mean? I said that there was nuance for sure. I didn't say anything was cut dry. But, like okay. So tell me. So somebody says that they're democrat, and so then on the subject of, on the subject of taxing the wealthy. What are they? For it or against it? | 592.7200310230255 | 615.1200310230256 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. Democrats. | 595.1794059276581 | 651.9000309276581 |

| SPEAKER_1 | There are a few people within the Democratic Party who are definitely for free health care, but you cannot say that because you're democrat, you're for free health | 615.8594059944153 | 680.8600709944153 |
| SPEAKER_2 | They're fucking tax the | 616.0600309371948 | 618.9700309371948 |

| SPEAKER_2 | claw? For smaller nails, so that, like, bigger nails, they can go further in and then you put the smaller nail, you put it into the small setting so that because the bigger are the nails, the more you could put it in there, or the less yeah. The more you're able to put in there, but if it's set to a small setting, you can't put it in there too far. I I don't really know. There's not too much of a significance. It just kinda helps with guiding it to make sure you're not, like, | 1957.8026130199432 | 1977.9226130199434 |

| SPEAKER_1 | I don't say anything to him if I see him looking at when it's already empty. But that's because he would do that to, Pookie all the time. So, like, | 5433.172821998596 | 5495.593446998597 |
| SPEAKER_0 | if she finished her food, granted, if it did have food in it, she would not she would not even, like, let him get near it. So that's how I knew it was empty of if he was in it. | 5439.852822065353 | 5503.733447065353 |
| SPEAKER_1 | She would always, like, lick it after she already ate everything. She's like, what are you doing? There's nothing in there | 5447.912822008133 | 5507.573507008133 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 5459.823446989059 | 5459.983416989059 |

| SPEAKER_00 | Take it. go ahead, take it, boy. | 5461.894385099411 | 5463.834385099411 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. | 5463.643446922302 | 5464.143446922302 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Am I correcto? | 5464.76344704628 | 5465.66344704628 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Well, I know that, but I'm just saying, like, that's like, I assume he's just, like, letting licking it because it's empty. Usually. Sometimes he gets brave and does | 5464.882822036743 | 5529.9134470367435 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I mean, like, lately, | 5504.462872028351 | 5561.823507028351 |
| SPEAKER_3 | stupid. Hi. | 5507.573507070541 | 5461.292822070541 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 5508.062792062759 | 5508.222822062759 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, she actually likes that food for some reason. That's why I feel like it. | 5510.542772054672 | 5571.553447054673 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. Exactly. | 5516.612771987915 | 5573.473406987915 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know. But she definitely seems to like that food more than the other one. The other ones I've been getting. Kinda, I don't really feel like Clyde likes those either. | 5519.022821903229 | 5584.493486903229 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it, but that's because you and I are both sitting here looking at him do it. And so when we don't tell him to stop before he does it, he just thinks it's okay. And then proceeds to do it and we don't even realize it for a few seconds. Seconds. So he's like, oh, the reward outweighs the the cost, I guess, or whatever. Yeah. There you go. So because he gotta waive with it for a second. I don't know. Because you know he'll sit there and like not touch it all day. Even when we're not here. Right? | 5529.913446903229 | 5503.212821903228 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So what do you mean? | 5539.2628219127655 | 5596.543446912766 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You think that she's not eating and Kai's eating her food? | 5543.062792062759 | 5601.5334470627595 |
| SPEAKER_2 | At least sometimes. Yeah. | 5546.672821998596 | 5604.113446998596 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Well, | 5548.372781991959 | 5548.872781991959 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I don't | 5549.602822065353 | 5606.119447065354 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But | 5564.2034471035 | 5564.2834471035 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that's why I've been saying it's because I think well, | 5564.283447027206 | 5566.363447027206 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Average house is | 5571.73344707489 | 5572.43344707489 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Maybe. | 5573.473407030106 | 5573.973407030106 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So | 5584.79344701767 | 5585.08344701767 |
| SPEAKER_0 | okay. | 5604.913407087326 | 5605.413407087326 |
| SPEAKER_0 | know. I mean, can't say for sure I I can't say for sure. So, I mean, if he's if I I don't let him do it. That's for sure. I know. I didn't think you I didn't say you did. I'm just saying because I haven't seen him do it, and so I don't know. Does side look better? I'm just saying. It's just that. | 5606.119446992874 | 5657.243486992874 |
| SPEAKER_3 | They're talking about you, fatty. Does he go potty or what? | 5608.582822084427 | 5668.063447084426 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Oh, | 5623.612771987915 | 5624.112771987915 |
| SPEAKER_4 | did I say, dad? You're asking if he was if he had to go potty? Yeah. | 5624.6027619838715 | 5683.383446983872 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. Like, when I cut them open because I just leave them, like, soaking wet and then pull them out of water and then cut them or whatever, but my hands are soaking wet and I thought I saw water in the yolks. | 5654.602822065353 | 5718.793417065353 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Over here, so I thought, like, should I be getting letting them get soggy? I don't think it matters so. I don't that's like literally | 5663.40282201767 | 5726.63344701767 |

Whether or not the eggs are getting soggy the yolks are getting soggy because I wasn't drying off the eggs. I don't know. | 5683.383446931839 | 5704.713446931839 |

| SPEAKER_1 | In terms of answering the question that's been put to us, is affirmative action good for America? I wanna be very clear about my it's not too mislead anyone. While affirmative action Certainly not an end all be all. It is certainly not sufficient If we are serious about creating racial equity in this country, I, nonetheless, am quite clear it is an important method not sufficient nonetheless important obtaining that goal. So I have very little trouble answering the question and the affirmative that affirmative action is indeed good for America, and it's good for the very same reason Was in the eyes of none other than Ronald Reagan, who I will tell you I have great pains to agree with But who in 1978, as an outgoing governor of the state of most very last acts that this man, of course, would change his mind. On the roads of the White House. One of the very last things that he would Do in office. In his waning weeks was to sign into law the very affirmative action programs, many of which were eliminated at least in part with the help of the gentleman I'm debating this evening, when proposition 209 was passed in that state 1996. And when Reagan signed into law those policies, which now provide the call racial preference was to delegitimize them. This is what he said. This is not me. This is what Ronald Reagan said. He said time and experience have shown that laws of nondiscrimination are not enough. Justice demands that each and every citizen | 0 | 147.210625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's right. Adopt and | 147.450625 | 148.91062499999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | is what Ronald Reagan said at one point. | 93.48998999999999 | 151.33061500000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Affirmative action A reality. What Reagan was suggesting as hard as it is to believe now in retrospect knowing we know about him ideologically, was that it was not enough to simply pass civil rights laws as we had done in the 19 sixties in imploring folks to treat everyone equally and to refrain from discrimination. He was suggesting that long entrenched patterns of discrimination against peoples of color and preferences and privileges and head starts for those of us who were white. Had created such an uneven playing field in this nation that conscious efforts, deliberate efforts and inclusion had to be made, and Reagan was right. In 1970 4, again, it pains me to say the words Reagan was right. But it was true. And the logic of that day still holds, as I'll demonstrate Affirmative action is ultimately good for America because it is one of the, again, not the only one and | 95.67 | 208.760625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | probably not | 208.760625 | 208.88063499999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | This is a debate. | 208.92062500000003 | 209.80062500000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 209.80062500000003 | 209.960625 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Institutionalized | 215.31062500000002 | 215.81062500000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | white racial preference and privilege the American job market, the educational system, and contracting, and other work. Affirmative action is an important mechanism for obtaining or coming closer to a true equal opportunity society, not merely in word, but in deed. In its absence white racial preference and privilege will remain untouched and entrenched and would in fact be strengthened to choice. And this is important. The choice | 161.91999999999996 | 242.700645 |

| SPEAKER_2 | as they are and have always been. | 219.11 | 276.310625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It will only end the programs that seek to minimize such preferences | 228.34000000000003 | 288.97062500000004 |

| SPEAKER_1 | however much America on the whole may not wish to acknowledge it. The history of this country is the history of racial preference. For my people. Beginning at least as early as, if not before the naturalization of 1790, which you should know but probably don't because no one ever taught you this before in all likelihood was the very first law. That the congress of the United States passed after the ratification of the constitution. Before they did anything else, first order of business leaped. Free white folk can only.

| SPEAKER_4 | He doesn't, like, I don't know. But | 397.80000000000007 | 457.140625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of white racial preference, but we don't talk about it like that. And we don't talk about the FHA and the VA loan programs for housing, but gun in the 19 thirties being white racial preference. But now for the | 422.49 | 489.250625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | first 30 years | 489.250625 | 489.770625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of | 489.770625 | 490.020625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the | 490.020625 | 490.270625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the only folks getting in on that government sub which in fact was the lynchpin of the building of the white middle class in this country. Were white folks. People of color could not get in on it. For the first 30 years, those benefits were almost exclusively for whites, a $120,000,000,000 in housing equity loan preferentially to white families, 35,000,000 of them. And yet that's how you my family got everything baseball hard work. Nobody ever gave us anything because of the color of our skin. Yeah. Nothing except that house. And nothing except that land and nothing except that job you got with the GI Bill, which was supposed to be for all GIs, but it didn't really go down like that in practice. Those are all policies that if we believed in honest language in this country, but we do not, we would call affirmative action and racial preference. Again, if it was benefiting black folks, we'd have called it wealth. But because it benefited white people, we call it good macroeconomic policy. And we just leave well enough alone, you see, And as a result of those and other policies, the | 434.77 | 555.370625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | average | 555.370625 | 555.600625 |

| SPEAKER_1 | life African American family, 8 times the average network of the typical Latino family got nothing to do with harder work, better value, better culture, better DNA, or any of that. It has to do with systematic preference, and none of that is gonna go away. You abolish affirmative action. If | 559.680625 | 580.290665 |
| SPEAKER_3 | anything Well, they did. Worse. Now | 580.430625 | 581.870625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | perhaps you believe that | 581.870625 | 527.36 |

| SPEAKER_3 | repealed the law | 532.53 | 589.730675 |
| SPEAKER_2 | or | 590.430625 | 590.910665 |
| SPEAKER_3 | or recently. Justice on the modern Very recently. Like, | 590.910665 | 542.09 |
| SPEAKER_4 | within the past year or 2, I | 598.0706250000001 | 599.590655 |
| SPEAKER_3 | think. | 599.590655 | 599.980625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | This | 544.3199999999999 | 544.68 |
| SPEAKER_3 | shit? Yep. | 600.660625 | 601.520585 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Well, now that they have | 602.220625 | 603.100625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the, right wing majority. | 603.100625 | 550.71 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Rampant. Affirmative action was indeed needed. August 10, 1994. The man I am debating this evening, testifies to the district committee of the California State Assembly, and he says, quote, there was a time when affirmative action had value There was discrimination, and we needed some sort of shock treatment. The time has come to take off the training wheels. End of quote. Now understand, what this means and why I had quoted him this evening. It means that mister Connolly cannot claim this evening to oppose race conscious efforts like affirmative action on principle. | 551.27 | 637.840625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Mhmm. | 582.42 | 582.81 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Because he is on record as admitting that as long as racial discrimination is rampant against folks of color, the programs are needed, which means, my friends, the only issue before us the only one is whether systemic discrimination still indeed exists, a against folks of color. If it does, and don't you just know I'm about to prove it? Damn. And affirmative action is both necessary and good. So what is the truth? 30 years ago, not 50 years ago, but right about now. Well, for 1, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, that's the agency charged Monitoring compliance with affirmative action and civil rights law more broadly has reported that upwards of 75% of all companies covered by equal opportunity requirements, not just affirmative action now, but even the civil rights act of 1964 that 3 out of 4 of those companies covered by the law are in substantial violation of law because of ongoing patterns of discrimination, not against white people. | 582.96996 | 702.9506250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Mhmm. | 647.77 | 648.17 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But it gets folks of | 648.41 | 705.680685 |
| SPEAKER_2 | color. | 705.680685 | 706.0606250000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The problem is that our government does not prioritize civil rights enforcement and has done so, be it run by Democrats or Republicans. And so, check up on each company once every that kind of discrimination as such, discrimination against people of color continues unabated whether we wish to see it or not. Moving on, 3 years ago, a study from MIT and the University of Chicago, both of their econ departments found that job applicants with white sounding names 50% more likely to get a callback for a job interview for an actual | 650.72 | 759.710625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | job than spoke with | 759.710625 | 760.720625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | black sounding names even when all relevant qualifications, merit indicators are indistinguishable from one another, important for two it suggests a pattern of ongoing discrimination against folk of color and job. | 704.97997 | 738.9 |
| SPEAKER_4 | So much. That's why he's evading it. The first time he started face, he was, like, you know, just now he's | 756.16 | 818.4005950000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like, | 818.620625 | 819.120625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | wow. | 764.8600299999999 | 765.3600299999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | He's like, what the | 821.5606250000001 | 822.600625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | fuck? | 822.600625 | 823.100625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So even with the felon, white guy more slightly more likely than a black guy without 1? A felony I'm in, not with the felon felon with the felony. | 778.1 | 844.500625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | How long is this debate? Because, like I don't know if it's | 800.6100299999999 | 858.9506250000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | It's just I think just the well, no. It is for sure that I just | 802.97 | 862.0656250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I started it. | 862.140625 | 863.110625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I saw it opening. Who's the opening statement? | 807.13 | 865.660625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | His opening statement | 811.3199999999999 | 869.4005950000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. Exactly. I can't even imagine what he could say. | 816.13 | 874.710625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | In | 822.01 | 822.25 |
| SPEAKER_1 | place. Still, those dollars, 91 out of a 100 of them received by white male businesses, not because they are better, not because they do better work, not because they submit lower bids. Hell, why companies been jacking the government using low bids and then charging 5 times as much when the bill really comes due. Think Halliburton. Think pretty much any company you wanna think of. For years, and they keep getting contracts. | 878.230625 | 898.8106250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. | 899.590625 | 899.670625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So it isn't about the bid. It's about price. | 899.670625 | 847.17 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Not who you know. | 848.37004 | 905.470665 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Knowing certain people giving subcontracts to certain people and those having racial impact even if it's not intended. Even if the contractors themselves are not overtly biased, you end up with a highly inequitable result, and none of this would end if affirmative action for people of color ended if anything, it would become worse. We also have white racial preference in education. Which won't be touched, we heard a lot about the racial | 905.470665 | 932.850665 |
| SPEAKER_2 | preferences | 932.850665 | 933.330625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | of | 933.330625 | 933.490625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | people | 933.490625 | 933.890625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of color at places like the University Michigan because gave 20 points to folks who Color. We didn't talk about the fact that if you're from the upper peninsula, you got | 933.890625 | 942.5606250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | 6 | 942.5606250000001 | 942.850625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | here. | 888.39 | 888.89 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What the fuck? | 889.14 | 945.9406250000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Do you have a preference on that basis? It ends up being Rachel's 5 points | 894.6999999999999 | 953.880625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Well, the cameras used to turn out to, like, the whitest looking fucking people in the crowd. | 898.30003 | 958.610625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | That's probably all that there is there, honestly. | 902.78996 | 960.6906250000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And they all | 960.6906250000001 | 961.170625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | look fucking, like, sad. | 961.170625 | 906.9499999999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. I mean Well, I'm hearing all this shit for, like, the first time. | 963.470665 | 966.6906250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. Maybe. | 911.4399999999999 | 968.500625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, | 968.500625 | 968.700585 |
| SPEAKER_5 | go go | 968.700585 | 969.260575 |
| SPEAKER_2 | back. Just | 969.260575 | 970.160625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | That's a that chick was just laying down. That one? She was just looking down. No. I thought She just was, like, on the actually on the phone or something. | 914.39995 | 982.600625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | The timing of it No. She looks like she's had, like, a realization, but you her | 928.18 | 933.8000000000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Maybe? | 990.4806249999999 | 990.9806249999999 |
| SPEAKER_5 | So, like, the timing and the pants out to her, the snow is not | 937.66 | 997.590625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Boom. | 997.670625 | 998.170625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | What is he like in the budget? The 4th white people | 943.7800000000001 | 1002.080625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | boy. | 1002.080625 | 1002.580625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Alumni, 90% of whom are more | 953.9399999999999 | 1011.8006250000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Our white to one of the top schools in Michigan, you got 10 extra points, but are the folks that went to those schools disproportionately white and affluent affluent? If you had an AP curriculum throughout your junior and senior year, you got 8 x for points. Which seems fair on face, but it's not because the schools that serve mostly white students only in Michigan, but around the country, have 3 times as | 955.82 | 1031.5106250000001 |
| SPEAKER_5 | many | 977.5300000000001 | 977.6899999999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Hello? As the schools Hello? Of | 1033.830625 | 1035.670625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | color. | 1035.670625 | 1036.170625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Doesn't mean | 988.4300000000001 | 1044.677425 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it's not that it's like folks who get bit out of shape about Black History Month. Because there isn't a white history month, but, of course, there is. It just goes | 1044.677425 | 1052.340625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | by | 1052.340625 | 1052.410625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | tricky name of May June. Okay. | 996.75 | 1054.740625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I | 1054.740625 | 1055.240625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Folks might say, well, that's all true. But, you know, affirmative action lowers merit standards, and that's untrue as well. In the job market, we know, for example, that 200 studies have been done on this topic in a meta analysis fancy language | 1004.5801000000001 | 1073.160625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's basically yeah. | 1019.7401000000002 | 1077.100625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That those persons who have benefited from affirmative action perform equal to or better than their white male counterparts once they are given the opportunity to prove themselves. And in terms of education, we know that the SAT and the LSAT, the | 1025.67 | 1094.710625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | MCAT | 1094.710625 | 1095.150625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the GRE are pathetically correlated with overall college performance. At most, they can explain 17% of the difference in the 1st year after you take the test. No correlation beyond that. In the state of California, mister Connolly is from, there is no correlation at Berkeley or UCLA your graduation rates above and beyond grades. And so, really, what we're talking about is reconceptualizing merit. And realizing that at the end of the day, the standards we use are neither fair nor equitable affirmative action is an important though not a complete tool for eradicating racial inequity and starting that discussion about what are the proper merit standards. Thank you. | 1039.49 | 1132.2606250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I'm glad I'm not I'm | 1077.24 | 1134.420625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 1134.670625 | 1135.170625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | can't. | 1079.3600000000001 | 1079.8600000000001 |

| SPEAKER_2 | an insult. Gamma | 1182.0106250000001 | 1182.900625 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Knife. Hey, | 1182.900625 | 1128.64 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Vinny. | 1184.620625 | 1185.120625 |

| SPEAKER_4 | hear. Oh, you're fine. I'm gonna hear too, | 1186.960625 | 1188.720625 |
| SPEAKER_6 | though. Good evening. I am delighted to, be among you. When, mister White Hello? | 1188.720625 | 1201.2606250000001 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I'm sorry. Could you | 1201.2606250000001 | 1202.060625 |
| SPEAKER_6 | shut as simple as he makes it a Blacks on one side and white on the other, people of color as he says And he conveniently glosses over the term affirmative action with without ever really saying what he means by | 1202.060625 | 1226.430625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that. | 1226.430625 | 1226.930625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | What? | 1172.5801000000001 | 1173.0801000000001 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Throughout my involvement in this issue, it has not been to dismantle quote, affirmative action. It has been to dismantle those policies that government practices which treat people on the basis of race, sex, | 1229.360625 | 1247.310725 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But he literally just explained how they do that anyway. Wait. What? | 1191.7700000000002 | 1251.530625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | It's not all the fucking policy | 1197.4601 | 1253.960625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | John f | 1254.160625 | 1200.5300000000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Kennedy Yeah. It's systemic. Yeah. Exactly. | 1256.5106250000001 | 1258.970625 |
| SPEAKER_6 | 10925. | 1259.520625 | 1260.020625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But | 1206.2899 | 1206.6100000000001 |
| SPEAKER_6 | for the first time | 1262.590625 | 1263.150525 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But at the same but yeah. | 1263.310625 | 1265.2506250000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Stupid. | 1209.8600000000001 | 1210.3600000000001 |
| SPEAKER_6 | And that executive | 1211.44 | 1268.320725 |
| SPEAKER_2 | order commanded all | 1268.380625 | 1269.660625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | federal agencies and | 1269.660625 | 1271.030625 |
| SPEAKER_6 | those doing business with the federal government to take, quote, affirmative action to ensure that no one would be discriminated against when doing business with the federal government. On the basis of those prohibited factors of race, color, and the like. After his assassination, The Congress ratified what president Kennedy had put into place and his executive order In the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and that act guarantees you and I and everyone in this room the right to equal treatment without regard without regard to race, or color, | 1215.2900000000002 | 1323.070725 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Now | 1268.67 | 1268.91 |
| SPEAKER_6 | it's awfully seductive for someone to say, that our society is racist at its core, and that we have | 1324.890625 | 1337.420525 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Now he's not like either of those people like Thomas Seltzel or Larry Elder. He's fucking, like, he sounds like he's trying to, like, confuse people or trying I don't know. He just sounds wrong. | 1281.91 | 1349.950625 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Like, | 1350.330625 | 1350.830625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it's | 1295.01 | 1295.17 |
| SPEAKER_3 | He sound like isn't he he's not confident at all on what he's saying. The | 1351.470625 | 1298.7 |
| SPEAKER_2 | logic is very logic is there, but No. | 1354.680625 | 1307.3301000000001 |
| SPEAKER_5 | It's it's not it's just not | 1363.444025 | 1365.560625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | How | 1311.0700000000002 | 1311.3100000000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | where's the logic? Where does he explain any of the logic? | 1367.690625 | 1370.2606250000001 |
| SPEAKER_5 | He's So he's saying that, like, he's against, like, all the policies that, like, that grant different | 1370.2606250000001 | 1376.590625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Different, | 1322.76 | 1322.8401000000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | People, different right place on color of skin. | 1324.2601000000002 | 1382.0006250000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Right? Yeah. | 1382.0006250000001 | 1382.640625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Get | 1382.640625 | 1383.140625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. | 1327.44 | 1327.94 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. Yeah. | 1384.620625 | 1385.030625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | And, like, he's he's saying that, like, those policies are bad because they because he dis disagrees with being treated different because of your race. So I affirmative action gives The darker you are, the more benefits just for lack of fucking Mhmm. Same saving words there. But, he says that he's saying that, like, that type of practice is unfair as for everybody should be treated exactly the same Like, despite race whatsoever | 1329.8501 | 1427.490625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Okay. Wait. You're right. On that. But where I where I I see it as being, not logical is by his actions and his, like, his actual, like, every other belief. If he if what he was saying was true, why is he not trying to, dismantle the racist criminal justice system as it is? And the way it operates. Why is he not going after I mean, because that is a race that is definitely based on race, whether not they call it that or not is a | 1428.050625 | 1462.680625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you know, it's | 1462.920625 | 1464.300625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | and he would, go after or he would be trying to dismantle the, stopping for his like, policies. He would be advocating against those things if he was, like, actually against that he wouldn't be sitting here talking about affirmative action, which is not it is not even based on race or gives, like, anybody, like, a special treatment based on race. It is like, the wording of it is, like, by historically under some stupid shit. I don't know. Whatever. | 1408.63 | 1497.220625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But, | 1441.64 | 1441.8000000000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, Under Under under under under under under | 1497.780625 | 1499.943225 |
| SPEAKER_3 | under under under under under under under something like that. Like, | 1500.0160250000001 | 1501.730625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | yeah. So I mean, the the It basically is saying well, we've definitely never we've definitely been discriminating against these people for Calver Long. And they're not able to you know, while we were sitting | 1446.51 | 1517.520625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | here | 1517.520625 | 1517.780625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | against them for other people this long, we're gonna try and make it up. Because obviously, the only reason why they are so they're not as in advantaged as white people are because of all of the discrimination we've done. So it's just kinda like like, you know you're black. Right? Like, dude, for | 1462.0400000000002 | 1534.770525 |
| SPEAKER_3 | real? | 1534.770525 | 1535.270525 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Is | 1479.6200000000001 | 1479.66 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I | 1535.680525 | 1535.840625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | mean, | 1535.840625 | 1536.240625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | his logic would be more sound | 1536.240625 | 1537.7606250000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | if his if his | 1537.7606250000001 | 1539.220625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | argument would have been | 1484.0101000000002 | 1540.950725 |
| SPEAKER_2 | made | 1540.950725 | 1541.430625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | further in the future | 1485.7700000000002 | 1543.370625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | when when | 1543.430625 | 1544.170625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | when | 1545.110725 | 1545.270625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the | 1545.270625 | 1545.770625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | playing field is closer to level. | 1490.5500000000002 | 1548.520625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | No. | 1492.9801 | 1493.4801 |
| SPEAKER_2 | You don't like | 1493.7700000000002 | 1550.390625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I don't think so. I think that if there's ever an argument for something like that, that means it's still necessary. That's just like that's just like whenever they got rid of the fucking, like, the, Like, like, there would be no reason for people to be getting mad about it. And wanna abolish it if they weren't wanting to abuse it. If they weren't gonna benefit from it being gone. Like, there's no reason to be sitting there in the future talking about it if it was, like, not necessary any if it was actually not necessary anymore. Because people would just forget about, you know, how many laws we have in place today and policy like bullshit? That we don't even know is it are a thing because And we just, like, say here and say, and break the law every day. For because | 1550.470625 | 1595.820625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Breaking the law. Yeah. Like, | 1595.980625 | 1596.860625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | and nobody's talking about those things. It's just like I don't know. Think it's | 1596.860625 | 1605.580625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | a | 1605.580625 | 1606.080625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Like, why why would you sit here and, like, what regardless, it's not a thing of, like, in the future, he should be, like, advocating for it to be gone because in the future, like, hopefully, in the future in the future, there's a freaking, like, system we have. I IBD today. So it's really not even | 1551.0600000000002 | 1627.680525 |
| SPEAKER_5 | just | 1627.680525 | 1627.940625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | it's not race that's, like, the issue anyways. It's | 1572.1999 | 1631.0006250000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | capital | 1576.8600000000001 | 1577.3600000000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I don't know. Just like | 1578.7 | 1637.340725 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I yeah. It's just I think it's, his logic isn't there, and he's not credible because he's not genuine. I he has felt like he has ulterior motives or I actually I just know anybody who's arguing against ulterior motives who's in a position of power. Or or | 1581.5500000000002 | 1656.580725 |
| SPEAKER_5 | advantage | 1657.280625 | 1657.370625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | is doing it from a disingenuous place. | 1602.0300000000002 | 1605.5001000000002 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Like, | 1661.780625 | 1661.940625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | position or whatever. Because if you if you're if you have any I mean, either that or he's just dumb. Because if you just fucking, like, think of you have any kind of critical thought about it, there's no reason why you should be wanting to dismantle it or say that that it can't be a thing anymore. I mean, I know that people are largely miseducated about it for sure. I use to definitely believe that it was not fair at all. I was like, what the | 1606.2799 | 1688.020625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | fuck? Why? I felt like I used to definitely think that and not, like, | 1688.020625 | 1691.810625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you know, the way it was described to me and just, like, how it make was, like, like, I couldn't be I didn't deserve it. You know? Any kind of | 1636.23 | 1702.340625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | help | 1647.0800000000002 | 1647.3199000000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | help up whatever kind of thing, but, like, | 1703.300525 | 1705.240625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | but | 1650.98 | 1651.48 |
| SPEAKER_4 | yeah. But, I mean, I get, like, I get it that the dad would know nothing should be based on race, but that's not really the plan. It's not based on, oh, | 1652.65 | 1722.870625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you're | 1722.870625 | 1723.280625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | black, so you get to be, you know, | 1667.3000000000002 | 1725.130625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Mhmm. | 1669.63 | 1669.8700000000001 |

| SPEAKER_4 | It's writing What is it called? It's lighting or wrong. Like, ours, I not | 1674.95 | 1684.2301 |

| SPEAKER_1 | I bring you greetings as one of the leading self proclaimed anti racist activists in the United States. I appreciate Chad and the folks at ISI putting this debate together and for all of you coming out. I know it's a busy week. In terms of answering the question that's been put to us this evening, is affirmative action. Good for America? I wanna be very clear about my position so as not to mislead anyone. While affirmative action is certainly not an end all be all, it is certainly not sufficient If we are serious about creating racial equity in this country, I, nonetheless, am quite clear that it is an important mechanism not sufficient, but nonetheless important for obtaining that goal. So I have very little trouble answering the question in the affirmative that affirmative action is indeed good for America, and it's good for the very same reason it was in the eyes of none other than Ronald Reagan, who I will tell you I have great pains to agree with on anything, But who in 1974, the outgoing governor of the state of California, one of the very large acts that this man, who, of course, would change his mind, on the road to the White House, one of the very last things that he would do in office. In his waning weeks was to sign into law the very affirmative action programs, many of which were eliminated at least in part with the help of the gentleman I'm debating this evening, when composition 209 was passed in that state 1996. And when Reagan signed into law those policies, which we now derive call racial preference as to delegitimize them. This is what he said. This is not me This is what Ronald Reagan said. He said time and experience have shown that laws of nondiscrimination are not enough. Just real and personal commitment to the action. Against peoples of color and deliberate efforts, and inclusion had to be made. And Reagan was right. | 138.667709 | 346.558334 |
| SPEAKER_0 | No Chickies chicken biscuit. K? Good | 290.977699 | 294.087709 |

| SPEAKER_2 | No. Take it to them get Good boy. The baby. | 356.788344 | 364.638334 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Balancing out and ultimately nullifying institutionalized white racial preference and privilege the American job market, the educational system, and contracting, in other words. Affirmative action is an important mechanism for obtaining or coming closer to a true equal opportunity society, not merely in but indeed, in its absence, white racial preference and privilege will remain untouched and entrenched and would, in be strengthened, the choice, and this is important. The choice in this country is not as where economy may have to believe between a society where there is affirmative action preference for people of color on the one hand, or on the other hand, a society where all are treated equally, that is not the choice. It is a choice between a society where racial preferences for whites remain in place | 310.687709 | 416.618334 |
| SPEAKER_2 | unchallenged and unmoderated by the countervailing force of affirmative action for people of color on the one hand, or a society where those white racial preferences systemic and institutionalized as they are and they're always dead, they will in fact be balanced and challenged by those efforts. It will only end the programs that seem to minimize such preferences as they operate each and every day in the lives of whites in this country myself very much. Include As you see, however much mister Connolly may not wish to acknowledge it and however much America on the whole may not wish to acknowledge it, The history of this country is the history of racial preference for my beginning at least as early as, if not before, the naturalization act of 1790, which you should know but probably don't because no one ever taught you this before in all likelihood was the very first law. That the congress of the United States passed after ratification of the constitution before they did anything else, the first order of business was to pass a naturalization act which said that all free white folk and only free white folk could be citizens of the United States, an act of affirmative action and racial preference that we strangely never call it. Fast forward 70 years or so to the 18 sixties and the passage of the homestead act, which allowed whites and virtually only whites 270,000,000 acres of land, most of it west of Mississippi, a 160 acres of family for $10 down, but black and brown folk couldn't get it and of course, it was brown folk land got jacked in the first place. 270,000,000 acres, and there are 70,000,000 white folk today as I speak living on that land, land that their families would never have had but for an act of Why? Rachel preference, but we don't talk about it like | 360.907709 | 531.848334 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that. That's crazy. | 531.848334 | 532.7483540000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 30, he says. Being white racial preference. But now for the 1st 30 years of those programs, the only folks getting in on that government subsidized, government guaranteed, This country were white folks. People of color could not get in on it. For the first 30 years, those benefits were almost exclusively whites, a 120,000,000,000 dollars in housing equity loan preferentially to white families, 35,000,000 of them. | 480.77770899999996 | 565.588334 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And yet that's how you | 510.967709 | 568.108334 |
| SPEAKER_2 | my family got everything based on hard work. Nobody ever gave us anything because of the color of our skin. Yeah. Nothing except that house. And nothing except that land and nothing except that job you got with the GI which was supposed to be for all GIs, but it didn't really go down like that in practice. Those are all policies that if we believed in honest language in this country, but we do not, we would call affirmative action and racial preference And if it was benefiting black folk, we'd call it wealth. But because it benefited white people, we call it good macroeconomic policy. And we just leave well enough alone to see And as a result of those and other policies, the average life black family in this country I don't mean the average wealthy white family. I mean, the average family in this country. I don't mean the average wealthy white family. I mean the average white family in United States has 11 times the net worth of the average African American family, 8 times the average net worth of the typical Latino family got nothing to do with hard or work, better about the systematic preference, and none of that is gonna go away. You abolish affirmative action. If anything, it will become worse. Now perhaps you believe that all that's in the past. | 512.447709 | 634.088334 |
| SPEAKER_1 | We should focus on the present. | 578.947709 | 636.468334 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Fine. Aside from how utterly convenient it is to shrug off the effects of past injustice on the modern day, racism, the fact is that that systematized white racial preference continues. As saying so long as discrimination was rampant, affirmative action Was indeed needed. August 10, 1994, the man I am debating this evening testifies to the judiciary committee of the California State Assembly, and he says, quote, there was a time when affirmative action had value There was discrimination, and we needed some sort of shock treatment. The time come to take off the training wheels. Quote, now understand, what this means and why I have quoted him this evening. It means that mister Connolly cannot claim this evening to a pardon of the race conscious efforts like affirmative action on principle because he is on record as admitting that as long as racial discrimination is rampant against folks of color, the pro are needed, which means, my friends, the only issue before us tonight the only one is whether systemic discrimination still indeed exists against folks of color. If it does, and don't you just know I'm about to prove it? His own His own words suggest that the debate is over and affirmative action is both necessary and good. So what is the truth? Not 30 years ago, not 50 years ago, but right about now. Well, for 1, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program, that's the agency charged with monitoring compliance with affirmative action and civil rights law more broadly has reported that upwards of 75% of all companies covered by equal opportunity requirements, not just affirmative action now, but even civil rights act of 1960 4, the 3 out of 4 of those companies covered by the law are in substantial violation of the law because of of ongoing patterns of discrimination, not against white people. But against folks of color, The problem is that our government does not prioritize civil rights and by Republicans. And so the office of federal contract compliance only has about 4,000 monitors on their payroll. Whose job it is to check up and see if folks are following | 581.4677089999999 | 773.578334 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the law | 773.958334 | 774.1883339999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That is so few that it's only enough to check up on each company once every 46 years. And determine whether or not they're in compliance. There's no determined To prevent that kind of discrimination as such, discrimination against people of color continues unabated whether we wish to see it or not. Moving on, 3 years ago, a study from MIT and the University of Chicago, both of their econ departments found that job applicants with white sounding names 50% more likely to get a callback for a job interview for an actual job than spoke with black sounding names even when all relevant qualifications merit indicate is that we are not the only ones who are it suggests a pattern of ongoing discrimination against folk of color, and it disproves quite mightily this notion of reverse discrimination because if indeed it was white folks that couldn't catch a break in the labor market and if indeed it paid to be black, this study would have been the one to prove it, man. You can just sort of put yourself in the place of the personnel director, and you come into the job on Monday, and you open up your mail, and see the resume, and you say, well, hot damn. Tamika has applied for the job. Oh, I must hire her. But you say Jamal applied? Hell, yes. Get Jamal in here, but now Mindy, uh-uh. No. No. Skyler, Jenny? | 718.767709 | 805.937679 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's so crazy. | 862.378334 | 863.598294 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm being sarcastic to Make a This study demonstrated the pattern of discrimination is the same as it ever was. 1 year later, a study out of Milwaukee finds that wiping in with a criminal record slightly more likely to get a callback than black men without one even when all the relevant qualifications, demeanor, dress, communication style, and every According to the National Center For Career Strategies, the vast majority, over 80 percent of all jobs, in this country are never openly advertised in they are filled by word-of-mouth through networks, and those tend to be largely race and gender exclusive in terms of who knows who, lives around whom, in this country that they will be scratched from the beginning of the race, so to speak, because they won't even be able to vote. And, also, the fact that even | 808.2077089999999 | 914.482434 |
| SPEAKER_4 | if folks of color are the most qualified person, there's a very good chance in this country that they won't be scratched from the beginning of the race, so to speak, because they won't even be able to vote. And | 914.482434 | 915.278334 |
| SPEAKER_2 | even know about the job availability because they are not in those networks. We know that this is one of the key reasons that 91% of all federal state and local contract dollars even with affirmative action in place. Still, those dollars, 91 out of a 100 of them received by white male businesses, not because they are better, not because they do better work, not because they submit lower bids. Hell, white companies been jacking the government using low bids and then charging 5 times as much when the bill really comes due. Think Halliburton. Think pretty much any company you wanna think of. For years, and they keep getting contracts. So it isn't about the bid. It isn't about competitiveness. It isn't about the quality of the work. It is about networks, knowing certain people, giving subcontractors to certain even if the contractors themselves are not overtly biased, you end up with a highly inequitable result, and none of this would end if affirmative action for people of color ended if anything, it would become worse. We also have white racial preference in education. | 859.2977089999999 | 979.098334 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Which one? | 923.3377089999999 | 980.018334 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But we heard a lot about the racial preferences for people of color at places like University of Michigan They gave 20 points to folks who've Color. | 924.8377089999999 | 932.437679 |
| SPEAKER_2 | We didn't talk about the fact that if you're from the upper peninsula, you got 16 points. I don't know if you've been | 932.997709 | 993.898334 |
| SPEAKER_4 | there. | 993.898334 | 994.288334 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The snow is not the only thing white in the upper when you give a preference on that basis, it ends up being racial. Four points for the children alumni, 92% of whom are more are white. If you went to one of the top schools in Michigan, you got 10 extra points, but who are the folks that went to those schools disproportionately white and affluent, if you had an AP curriculum throughout the junior and senior year you got 8 extra points. Which seems fair on face, but it's not because the schools that serve mostly white students, not only in Michigan, but around the country, had 3 times as many AP and honors courses offered per capita as the school | 939.347709 | 1029.308334 |
| SPEAKER_4 | state | 974.607709 | 975.107709 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Just because it isn't blatant, just because it doesn't call itself that, doesn't mean it's not that. It's like folks who get thin out of shape about Black History Month. Because there isn't a white history month, but, of course, there is. It just goes by the tricky name of May and June and July and August and September Folks might say, well, that's all true. You know, affirmative action lowers merit standards, and that's In the job market, we know, for example, that 200 studies have been done on this topic and a manner that's fancy language quality of other people's It's good for the all be all. It is certainly not sufficient coming out. I know it's a busy week, | 979.0677089999999 | 1081.388334 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Tables, these sort of circular to dates. Lightning. I think it it really the one person they focus on in particular really kind of skewers Ben Shapiro, just by remaining calm and asking him to clarify his positions let's take a look at this together. I'm gonna chime in with my comments addition to theirs. Shapiro, we talked something about it with, Harris' seemingly rightward turn towards immigration, but then | 59.44999999999993 | 153.43058499999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | happened. | 100.42999999999995 | 100.92999999999995 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Here's | 101.42999999999995 | 101.6299499999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | what happens. I don't believe that it's in a economic benefit to the United States to bring in a | 157.61057499999993 | 161.880625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Within days Eventually, came the announcement that everyone would wait. The nightmare went | 146.1099999999999 | 222.780625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Exploded in | 173.39 | 230.250625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | and | 191 | 191.5 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I looked And said had there was use of the firm. | 239.79999999999995 | 333.120625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It | 278.49005999999997 | 278.6500299999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | now appears that more than 100,000 | 334.63065499999993 | 336.250625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Okay. For those of us who aren't in the room, I would say it was about 1 If you could control things, would you want every other nation to become as wealthy as West. Would you want them to become as democratic as the West? Yes. | 330.65999999999997 | 410.2806249999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Oh, we | 354.69989999999996 | 411.57062500000006 |
| SPEAKER_5 | the riffraff out there outside the western trying to come to our shores that we are civilized and we are better. Well, take the Democratic Republic of Congo. The king of built you created the slave colony there for 30 years, then And now today, Glencore, one of our greats, corporations is mining all sorts of couples | 363.87 | 450.650625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that | 394.96000000000004 | 395.46000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_5 | is just giving 0. 0. I'd like to live in the west which is not a parasite. On people, but it then denigrates by saying you are at the very trough and you want to come to a beautiful garden. And this is why You know, and and therefore, our aim is to stop you from coming. Which is going to | 452.46062499999994 | 473.7506249999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Okay. But he's the ultimate aim? I mean, if you could do it. But yes, you don't have whatever the mining companies doing whatever they do in other nations. But those nations build up. I'm just wondering if the dream is | 418.25 | 438.0001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a multipolar | 438.8901000000001 | 495.19062499999995 |
| SPEAKER_4 | world | 495.19062499999995 | 495.69062499999995 |
| SPEAKER_5 | is to have cooperation, solidarity, and change in development of everyone that lives on this planet. | 443.1400000000001 | 506.7806249999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And the multipartal world is an atrocious idea. Whose | 506.7806249999999 | 455.52 |
| SPEAKER_3 | consequences will be exactly the consequences we have when you see a multipolar world within one country. That country is Mexico. Mexico is controlled by a large number of cartels. And when one of them is taken out, what it chooses is a chaotic fight for dominance again. And the multipolar world will lead to conflagration inevitably because somebody has to be on top. It's unavoidable and somebody has to be on top. You know, point about cooperation is entirely wonderful, but the best way to predict human behavior is to look at human behavior in the past. When is this great age in which everyone just sat together and would bring | 455.76 | 549.950625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | back | 549.950625 | 550.110725 |
| SPEAKER_3 | slavery? | 550.110725 | 550.590625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Because | 550.590625 | 550.910625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | almost every society has subjected May I address what Janus has said repeatedly actually? I think it's important to do so. The What he said on the stage in June's presentation is entirely true, which is that many of the riches of Western societies are the product of the resources that were taken from other parts of the world. What I'm afraid this analysis analysis is missing is the fact that during that time, as during the present time, the entire world was competing on that very same model. The only reason that the European and superiority from super super | 550.910625 | 592.956025 |
| SPEAKER_5 | technology. And they were not in period. | 593.130625 | 595.390625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Europe. | 545.8300000000002 | 546.3300000000002 |
| SPEAKER_5 | That | 548.5800000000002 | 549.0800000000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | set out Yeah. Yeah. Destroy that. Yeah. Right. We both just started. Concert it. It's it's too I'm also slightly Greek, so this is Greek on Greek violence | 605.120725 | 614.670625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | here. | 614.8106250000001 | 615.3106250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Get to the because otherwise well, I'm afraid I'm gonna need a little time to to the point, especially if I'm interrupted. So every other civilization in human history has practiced slavery in one form or another. Every other civilization, including the native Americans who were enslaved each other and anyone they could find. The Middle Eastern Arab slave trade across the Sahara Desert was worse and lasted longer than the transatlantic slave trade. And every other great empire in history attempted to practice slavery to the very best of its ability to do the very thing Ghanys rightly accuses western powers Now the reason the west was more successful at this is it was more technical. More technologically advanced and was able to transport people across oceans a way that at that time no other civilization could. So, yes, it is true that the Western history is one of colonialism and enslavement, but that is only because we were better at it than other people. That's the only reason that we are where we | 561.25 | 679.7906250000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | are. So just to go by we'll come to you in a minute, but just to go back to the specific question. | 679.7906250000001 | 628.2 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yes. | 684.200625 | 684.700625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Should we be aiming towards a multipolar world? You would say look. We're a competitive world. Let's just compete against everyone else. | 629.3801000000001 | 693.0505249999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I would say that the best world is a stable one. And the construction we have had for some time now has been one of the best periods in human history. Since the end of world war 2. Now why has that been left? Well, I would argue for the billions of people around the world who've been lifted out of poverty, | 637.6301000000001 | 710.5306249999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and | 655.9100000000001 | 656.1000000000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | In addition to for the west. Now, is that maintainable? Well, that's I think the issue that we're in discussion about. I don't know if that's maintainable, but my argument that argument I made a lot with the reason that we're having this debate about slavery is that I consider western values I don't think we should bomb them into the people of Iraq and Afghanistan as as some of our leaders have been attempting to do. But they are the best values, at least for of us who want to live in the west and we should maintain them as much as we possibly can | 656.6601 | 741.910625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and | 686.7 | 686.8599000000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | then other people may wish to buy into that worldview as well. No one suggests that the United States or the perfect. I would not suggest that even to this day, all people in America are treated equally. Whether that's on sex or race or whatever like But which country has made more progress? We talk endlessly in the west about Okay. What other great civilizations in the world are better at race relations than we are. Is it Russia? When I was last in Russia, was a song playing on the metro which was killed it a Negro, la la la la la. He can't play basketball and anymore. In China, one of the most which is the was a Chinese girl who is approached by a black man She pours him off and shoves him into washing machine. She puts the product that is being advertised into the washing machine and what's the payoff? He comes out Chinese. Where is this great world to which we are comparing ourselves | 742.8405250000001 | 805.8106250000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | to? You cannot | 805.8106250000001 | 806.610725 |
| SPEAKER_2 | compare our civilization | 806.610725 | 807.830625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | if you don't have to compare it to reality. And in reality, we are the best civilization in existence today. And that is why we must maintain our dominance around the world. | 808.0506250000001 | 818.690625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And no one seems to be arguing with that. Are we good enough? I don't agree with that at all. A lot of people are. We'll come back to that. But are we good enough? I just want to we're never gonna be good enough. Are you good enough? | 818.690625 | 829.220525 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Are you good am I good enough as a human being? Have I worked out the right way to treat my wife or my son to the perfect so that I can I no | 773.48 | 838.130625 |
| SPEAKER_6 | longer Lovett, | 838.130625 | 839.190625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No? So why should we expect our civilization to be perfect? We should only expect it to be as perfect as a possibly can be and better than others. That's all that there is. Only comparison nothing else. And if you're comparing us to the land of milk and honey, you are dangerous. | 789.97 | 863.590625 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Okay. But I would agree. There's a third thing. It's not just accepting that we're not perfect and and and that we're than others, but actually actively working to improve | 863.590625 | 872.7607250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | actually internally, which | 872.7607250000001 | 873.6956250000001 |
| SPEAKER_6 | I | 873.6956250000001 | 873.910625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | not hearing you advocate for. You have not me, but I'm very happy to advocate. We had this discussion very briefly. We had this discussion over dinner last night about, diversity and inclusion. In all these programs which are intended to bring people into the thing. And I I say to all of that, the right objective difficult as it is to achieve in any society, is that there should be 0 to discrimination. Zero discrimination against people. And what we have today in the modern west is a new framework of discrimination. We have decided that it is okay to | 818.1700000000001 | 906.680625 |
| SPEAKER_6 | discriminate. Oh my god. | 852.54 | 915.8405250000001 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Are | 859.99 | 860.3951 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you | 916.3757249999999 | 916.7806249999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | If you were Jewish, Or Asian or white, it is much harder for them to get into an American university because all of those groups are widely discriminated against in | 861.04 | 870.9899 |
| SPEAKER_5 | that society. That's simply untrue. | 926.970525 | 928.8305250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | That is factually correct. That's simply untrue. | 873.1200000000001 | 930.380625 |
| SPEAKER_5 | For | 930.380625 | 930.880625 |

| SPEAKER_6 | This guy is being locked out, but is it a like, the debate is getting laughed at by the audience for saying that what that there's new a new framework of discrimination and it's against white people? And, like, and the audience was laughing at him. This is like a I don't know. I can't even I don't even know how this whole how this is a thing where this guy is sitting here | 886.9300000000001 | 966.2506249999999 |

They're more serious about what they like, he's just like a joke, I guess. I mean, not only for saying that, all of the other shit you said before, that was kind of insane, but I was just laughing at the audience, laughing at Hey. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Well, you took forever. | 911.1500000000001 | 1001.7607250000001 |

It's not funny. People who laugh at other people's pain Normalize The material conditions and their situation and laying it all on the person it normalizes it and alienates them.

| SPEAKER_0 | Just Fantastic question. To create a webhook that runs your Node. Js package when a new memory is created, here's a step by step guide. 1, set up a webhook endpoint in your Node. Js app. C, Karen use a framework like Express JS to create a server that listens for in incoming HTTP requests, define a route, CG, webhook that will handle the post requests sent when a new memory is created. 2, expose your local server to the Internet. Since your server runs locally, you'll need to make it accessible online. You've explored using grok for this purpose before. Install Grok and run Grok HTTP report number, to get a public URL that tunnels to your local server. Hi. Configure the memory service to send webhooks in the platform where memories are created. Perhaps only app you can develop it with Set the webhook URL to the public URL provided by ngrok. Ensure that the service is set up to send a post request to your in your Node. Js app. In | 0 | 1.4693749999999945 |
| SPEAKER_1 | your webhook root, write the logic you want to execute when a new memory is received. Access the data sent in the webhook. Usually in the request body. Then process it as needed. 5. Security considerations. Validate incoming requests to ensure they're from a trusted source. Implement authentication mechanisms like tokens, or secret keys if the memory service supports it. 6, test your setup. Create a new memory entry to trigger the webhook. Verify that your Node. Js package runs as expected in response to the webhook. You've been delving into app development and integrations lately. So this is a great way to expand your skills. If you run into any bumps, or should I say waves, feel free to share. And we'll quack through it together. The code sparkle. Computer, Sparkles? November 20, 2023.

| SPEAKER_0 | What is a webhook? | 0 | 57.200625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Notes. Quack. Quack. Ash. Duck. Great question. Quack quack ash. Great question. Webhook is like a friendly duck messenger between 2 It allows 1 app to send real time data or notifications to another app whenever a specific event occurs. Imagine you're working on a Project. And you want your application to react immediately when something happens on another service. Like when someone posts a new message. Or updates their profile. Instead of your app constantly checking. Polling for updates, a webhook quack stuck. To your app, saying, hey. Something just happened. Webhooks help you. Receive real time updates without the need to continuously check for changes. Simplify communication between different services, enhance user experience by making your app more interactive and responsive, They're a fantastic way to make your applications more dynamic. If you'd like to dive deeper into how to use webhooks in your JavaScript projects, I'm here to help you waddle through the process. Let's crack that code together. Computer, Sparkles?

| SPEAKER_0 | You know, my research shows that there are limitations men's feminism. That does not mean they're the bad guys. Right? That's of the book, good guys, bad guys is really about this juxtaposition that feminist men and men's rights activists are making between themselves and other other men. Right? Where the good guys They're the bad guys. You know, I think all the feminists that I interviewed have very good intentions. They are actually you know, genuinely concerned about inequality and, like, sincerely committed. To the idea that, you know, of divesting ourselves from privilege. I think there are considerable limitations to what they can do for feminism? Given the way they're thinking about feminism, what brought them into the movement, right, the the kinds of activism they're doing if they're doing activism. Know, my goal if feminist men read this book would be to, like, think about those dynamics around their identity and how that may be linked | 0 | 58.379999999999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | do differently. And then I think for, like, everyone who cares about gender inequality, and I would say, you know, this applies to racial inequality too, all kinds of inequality would you know, if we think about any high status group member. Again, like, rethinking our movements not as labels, but as practice. That's done collectively again, for collective liberation, and, like, how can we make sure that we're, like, providing you know, if you're part of an activist organization, how can we make sure to, like, capitalize on men's interest in, like, proving that they're good can provide them with, like, easy on ramping activism and, like, make it more involved every time. Right? How do we get them to, like, actually do feminism? And, again, like, pointing out misogyny where it exists, including in the men's rights movement, Yeah. And if there are any instructors listening, like, thinking about how how can you teach? Young people to recognize structural inequality because I think we we see big reverberations of young people's, especially young men's inability to do that in the election. You know, not understanding, like, what are the stakes for inequality with another Trump presidency So teaching young people to do that, I think, is gonna be really important. | -0.3806250000000069 | 131.25 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Their interpretation of the claim that they're privileged is if I'm privileged, | 0 | 60.10062499999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that means I'm bad. Right? Or if people see think I'm privileged, that means they think I'm bad. And so they have to resolve that. They wanna be seen as good good men. And so they're looking for strategies to do that. And gender activism is one of those strategies. Right? I call it in the book a privilege renegotiation strategy. It's a way for them to, right, renegotiate their identity in light of this new threat. Right? This new information that they may be privileged. They may be seen as immoral. So for feminist men, associating with feminism, is way to make themselves feel like and be seen as exceptions to the rule that men are the bad guys. Right? They can say, you know, I know men are privileged, but I'm actually an ally. I've divested from privilege. You know, I'm I'm a good man. Men's rights activist. Their movement denies that men are privileged at all. Right? And claims that actually men are disadvantaged by feminism. And so in associating with that movement, men's rights activists can feel like they're actually the victims and morally blameless. And even more than that, you know, because they're meant to act as if they're actually, like, fighting on behalf of the little guy. Right? They're, like, supremely moral because they kind of see through this feminist mindset. Right? So for both groups of men, it really comes down to, like, the identity becoming visible it that being really uncomfortable grappling with the idea that other people see them as privileged and then searching for this way to resolve those feelings.

That's That's Spectrum. | 136.49 | 212.41058499999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Were there any kind of key factors that you found or catalysts of sort of which way these men took their self reckoning whether it flipped the boards kind of one or the other path. | 164.43999999999994 | 233.500625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. Definitely. That's the $1,000,000 question. So I think there are a lot of things that matter for that that, you know, maybe we can't control. So that would be, like, mothers were very important in the stories of feminists. And, you know, we're not we can't select people into different families. So that's not really, a policy point. Right? But, like, more broadly, relationships with women or really important and, like, non familial women, I would say, were were more important relationships with other. The key was that those relationships have to be egalitarian So for soon be feminist men, you know, they have these, like, really close relationships They didn't have to be, like, girlfriends, but intimate relationships with women that they were like, on the same level as, right, There was respect there. There was closeness there. Very often, these relationships were made during college. Right? Which is a time where we have, like, more close contact with people of the gender than us. And | 178.88 | 293.56062499999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | so in these relationships, | 293.56062499999996 | 294.860625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | these soon to be feminist | 239.67999999999995 | 296.780625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | men | 296.780625 | 297.280625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | course, they also came into contact with that claim that they were privileged as men. So very often, it came from those close trusted | 241.78999999999996 | 304.19062499999995 |
| SPEAKER_3 | women. | 304.410625 | 304.740625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And it came in the context of those women describing their experiences of inequality like, there they're just their lives as women. Right. And in that context, it was much harder for those men to have, like, that immediate knee jerk reaction of, like, I'm not a bad guy. How dare you tell me I'm a bad guy? | 248.99996999999996 | 321.44062499999995 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Because they trusted | 265.9599999999999 | 322.58062500000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | these women. And they knew what those women were were were saying was true. So that was like a big part of the stories of feminist men. Whereas for men's rights activist, you know, they didn't describe the similar types of relationships to me. But also when they talked about coming into contact with that claim, that then It was very often they came into contact with it online. Or in reading by themselves. It was not in the same context of relationships. Right? And so it was was easier for them to have that defensive reaction. And to kind of immediately double down to, like, no. I'm a good man, and so what what this person online is saying to me or this reading that someone assigned to me in college is is wrong. Right? This is not true. So that was an interesting thing that came out, and so what I see is, like, women are doing the work of teaching men about inequality? Which, of course, is unfair. And also, like, not replicable on a scale, like, to win an election. But I have, like, some ideas about how that labor can be replaced. And I think a lot of it can happen in | 322.58062500000005 | 333.78 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Thinking a lot about, like, how I as an instructor can teach students to recognize structural inequality. It's so hard to do. It's really a skill. And so, like, how do we teach especially young people to see that when maybe those young people have always grown up in a world that you know, they've been told women and girls can do anything they want. Right? They're strong and powerful. Celebrities are calling themselves feminists. There are stem calls for girls. How do we teach them to see the inequality that you know, those things. Right? Stem cuts are a reaction to that inequality, but they need to be able to see inequality in the 1st place. This might be an obvious question, but why Why is that | 411.13745 | 452.47745 |
| SPEAKER_1 | inequality is so hard to see even in a world where we do have like you said. Stem clubs for girls and, you know, this kind of culture that suggests, hey. We are doing these things in response to the reality of inequality. | 452.82745 | 464.93744999999996 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I think when we're talking about men in particular, | 466.48745199999996 | 468.42744999999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | identities, they only we each only have one subjectivity. We only have our own experience. There's lots of research that shows people with low status group identities are, like, more attuned to inequality because they have to be. Right? Have to think about that to get what they need and what they want. It's part of that the privilege of having a highest status identity just like the identity itself being invisible. That's part of the privilege. Another part of the privilege is, like, not having to be attuned to inequality. I think in general, it's really hard to see structural inequality, particularly in taught that where all individuals can achieve anything we want if we try hard enough. There's such a strong culture of individualism and meritocracy. And, like, personal agency that it's really, really hard You know, just speaking as an instructor, it's really hard to teach people that, like, actually your experiences like, yes. You have Mhmm. Agency. But your agency is so constrained Bye. Your environment, the family you grew up in, the institutions you're a part of, Wait. It's really hard to teach people that because it's just so ingrained in us that you know, we are these powerful individuals that can overcome anything if we make the right decision. | 411.16682499999996 | 491.56681499999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And I would imagine that it | 547.5474399999999 | 548.6674499999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is | 548.6674499999999 | 549.05745 |
| SPEAKER_2 | masculinities. Right? | 496.086825 | 553.60744 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. Absolutely. Because those qualities, right, of, like, agency and strength, those are masculine qualities too. Right? If we had to gender type them, they would be masculine. It's, I think, particularly difficult for men to recognize that. Both because, you know, it would mean that they're privileged and they would have to grapple with that. Right? Just the understanding | 497.97683499999994 | 574.4174499999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that | 574.47745 | 574.71745 |
| SPEAKER_1 | some of the things they've accomplished maybe have have not been by virtue of their own hard work. And You know? Then what does that mean about me as a man? And | 574.71745 | 528.106825 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I should have asked this earlier, but when we are talking about | 529.046825 | 588.7724499999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Actually, that's part of the story. Right? Is that everything I've just described of, like, I'm being called privileged and that means I'm immoral, and I have to figure out how to deal with that. And a good man again. That's happening for their gender identity but it's also happening for straightness and it's happening for whiteness. When I interviewed feminist men about, like, these dynamics, I wouldn't bring up their sexuality or their race, but they brought it up themselves because those identities are so intertwined, and so they needed to really figure out a way to deal with that. And feel like good men and make sure other people knew that they were good men. Same things same with the men's rights activists is, like, they thought they were being really Targeted. Because they were straight white men, right, that the other people thought they were especially bad. And interesting thing is that a lot of the feminists that I interviewed also described themselves, for example, as anti racist. Or, like, allies to queer people. Like, I'm thinking of 1 feminist man in my sample who, when he was a k twelve teacher, Agree. | 620.085396 | 680.855396 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that, you know, the principal asked him to do it, and he knew there were queer staff members that could have done it, but he decided to do it because he was like, you know, I think without me as a straight man doing this, the club is not gonna have institutional support. So they were looking for other opportunities, right, related to these other identities, not just masculinity. Men's rights activists weren't doing that same thing because, like, it gets workier of, like, if I'm engaging in white nationalism, for example, that's not signaling to people that I'm a good man. Or it becomes, yeah, more fear there, I think. There was one of the mentor doctor in my sample did identify as, like, a white nationalist as well, and we talked a lot about his involvement in thought movement. Again, as a way to resolve his feelings related to his weakness. Are the feminist men kind of cognizant at all of these kinds of limitations to their feminism. So one thing feminist men were very conscious of was the reward that they got. Being a feminist. And that was uncomfortable to them. For example, speaking of anti racism, right, one of the feminists in my sample talked about, like, going to this protest. Against racism at the university he worked at, and, like, his colleagues of color, like, really being glad he was there and being like, oh, did you see who's not here? Right? Like, which white person's not here? And he was very uncomfortable with that. And you know, part of that discomfort is that it disrupts the identity project he's trying to do. Like, people congratulating feminist men uncomfortable for them because it brings up again that they're privileged. Right? They wouldn't be getting this reward if they weren't for doing it or in this his case for being white. He's getting this extra, reward And so they were very cognizant of that because it kinda sparked the same feelings. I'm like, oh, no. I'm privileged. Like, I just wanna disappear into this good group. I don't wanna be seen as, you know, special. I think the thing that they were really not cognizant, of what's the kind of rhetorical they were doing around their identity that also perpetuates inequality. So, like, it's totally unintentional, but you know, when they're talking about their own masculinity, they would compare themselves to other men who were not feminists. And very often, they would draw on, like, traditionally masculine characteristics to differentiate themselves from non feminist men. So, like, You know, agency being the prime one that, like, I'm so strong. I've risen above my socialization. I've risen above my privilege in the way people treat me. And I've divested from privilege. Like, I've accomplished that. And so, like, that makes me supremely moral and also supremely masculine. Right? Because I I was able to do all that. And when they do that, again, it's unintentional, but it's part of this identity project they're doing to feel like be seen as good men. But when they do that, it recreates inequality among masculinities. Right? They're recreating a hierarchy there. That's still about who's the most masculine. And because it's a masculine characteristic, like agency rationality was another one. Because it's a masculine characteristic, there's also, like, this implicit comparison to femininity. So think that's one dynamic that they were really unaware that they were doing. And that's because you know, I think the ways we construct our identity | 619.544771 | 896.985396 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Full kind of male feminism. What do you not recommend doing? I list a lot in the book, but I think one that I'm thinking a lot about | 940.734421 | 949.4144210000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | are so interwoven with inequality. | 843.554751 | 901.395396 |
| SPEAKER_0 | is this idea that you know, again, I'm so strong. I've risen above my privilege. I've done it. Right? I've divested from privilege. I think we really need to rethink that, and men really need to think rethink that in particular. Right? Men cannot divest from privilege unless the structures that create that privilege are destroyed. Right? Privilege is not something you can shed. You certainly can't do it individually. It's not a one time thing. Right? And so I think it's really about rethinking privilege and feminism. Right? Feminism is not like a label you can slap on and be like, I'm a good person now. Which unfortunately you know, for a lot of the feminists that I interviewed, just calling themselves a feminist was enough. 2 make them feel like the people. They didn't have to do any activism even. Yeah. So I'm so I guess it's not some | 950.094421 | 1000.214421 |
| SPEAKER_1 | collectively. Has to be for collective liberation, not just for, like, resolving your feelings. I think we need to continue to think that way, and it's really hard again thinking about, like, the meritocratic individualist society we live in. This is such a neoliberal idea to think like feminist feminist is a word that I put on myself and, like, now I have a new identity. Right? It's really hard to fight that idea. Because it's so ingrained in our culture. But it does let men off the hook for, like, doing more deep thinking and, like, more organizing. So I think that's one thing. And then I also think, like, stemming from like, what brings men into feminism when they do activism Very often that activism really centers the concerns they came with. Right? So it centers, like, I'm uncomfortable with my privilege. How do I resolve that? It centers the concerns of straight white cis men. So, you know, for example, many of the men I interviewed those who did do activism, they were part of or ran men's groups where, like, men allies would come together Very often though, those groups were, like, therapeutic spaces, right, to talk about the challenges of masculinity and the challenges of being an ally. But it didn't move beyond that. Right? It didn't move into organizing. | 941.473796 | 1071.484421 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Quality. And on | 1110.598931 | 1112.618931 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the flip side, what to do about the rights activists? | 1113.158931 | 1118.128931 |

| SPEAKER_0 | There were other, you know, sort of smaller bits of pushback that came this week. We all know we've been talking about this open Florida senate seat, and part of me always thought that Trump had actually picked Marco Rubio, who is a city senator of Florida, a secretary of state. It was one of his first picks. | 0 | 14.01 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Of interest up the wazoo. even with one of the provisions that was stripped out of the bill that ultimately did pass, it would have put more of a provision that would have restricted what | 68.45628309249878 | 78.81628309249878 |

| SPEAKER_01 | China. it benefits elon musk and his business interests to have that taken out, and it was. that's very counter to what america is trying to do right now, either biden or trump. so there were a lot | 79.69628310203552 | 91.41628310203552 |
| SPEAKER_02 | Of questions. there were people on both sides, calling, who is, who's president? who's the president -elect? is it musk? is it trump? one republican congressman called him the prime minister musk, prime minister musk, along with president trump. so there was a lot of questions about who was in charge. at one point, trump reacted to it, his speech on sunday, and said, well, elon musk can't be president because he's not a u .s. wasn't a foreign in the u .s. but the fact that he needed to push back, even though it was said in jest, and some of these comments were said in jest and some weren't, just goes to show that there is a lot of concern from both parties about | 91.41628313064575 | 128.31628313064576 |
| SPEAKER_0 | While Elon Musk can't be president, because he's not the US was not involved in the US. But the fact that he needed to push back even though it was said in just some of these comments were said in jest and some weren't. Just goes to show that there is a lot of concern from both parties about the amount of power and sway Musk has over national and international matters. The New York Times reported this week that basically, Musk has not left Trump's side. Even on Wednesday of this week, Trump had a lunch with Jeff Bezos, who we discussed last week, who has all of these conflicts as well with the Washington Post. And owning Amazon and and a space company and the 2 of them were seated together. | 114.37939310073853 | 154.05939310073853 |
| SPEAKER_02 | And sway musk has over national and international matters. the new york times reported this week that basically musk has not left trump's side. even on wednesday of this week, trump had a lunch with jeff bezos, who we discussed last week, who has all of these conflicts as well with the washington post and owning amazon and a space company. | 128.45628309249878 | 149.65628309249877 |
| SPEAKER_00 | And the two of them were seated together. musk was not invited. musk just walked in and joined the lunch. obviously musk and bezos are also competitors. so that stood out. | 149.6562831401825 | 160.3762831401825 |
| SPEAKER_02 | So these two, it's very unclear who's doing what, but in the meantime, and this is a thing we've discussed in the past, biden, save for issuing a myriad of pardons, | 160.37628316879272 | 170.47628316879272 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Has inexplicably kind of disappeared from the public eye. if you follow this project the first time, it's very different from when president barack obama was leaving office. and day in, day out, there was stuff going on that was made public. he was doing things with his administration to safeguard democracy. | 170.4762830734253 | 187.43628307342527 |
| SPEAKER_00 | He could have possibly had passed. and i assume some of that is happening in the background, but barack obama was very much in the forefront of speaking out until the day he left and saying one president at a time. whereas we are now in a space where president biden is largely absent. i mean, trump is making, continuing to make comments on national security matters. he's continuing to insert himself on foreign policy. this week, you know, he's back to his craziness with greenland and the panama canal that we're going to take over both of those. but notably, biden is absent. there was an article in the wall street journal, which i know you're going to | 188.45628309249878 | 224.4762830924988 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Absent. There was an article in The Wall Street Journal, which I know you're gonna say Wall Street Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch. It's conservative, and it is. And they're is notably like a Fox News of editorial boards. But their reporting side is has some really strong reporting. And I I linked to this article And the weekly list. They have an article that is well sourced that's a question whether Biden has been experiencing cognitive decline during his time in office. And how his administration had kind of shelved him during that time. And so there is also, since we're recording this for purposes of history, some question as to why Biden isn't being more public and speaking out in any way. He's really just not invisible. In closing out, I wanna talk about another important theme, and this is you know, a continuation of something we've discussed every week, but really we touched on last week, the wealth and power in this country trying to curry favor with Trump. What | 221.67371201515198 | 278.31371201515196 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It it was Yep. Was comical. Now Opposite is happening in a very frightening way that corporations and I'm going to name names and continue to name names in this podcast and other listed on the weekly list. But I want to keep talking about the extent to which wealthy and powerful folks are seeking to grieve favor with Trump ahead of his officially taking power. You know, it's something we've discussed as obeying in advance, acquiescing to him, legitimizing, a for play, basically, is what they're doing. But this is happening in the light of day and Broadly. Trump's inauguration, we talked about last week. A number of tech titans who are making $1,000,000 donations. To his inauguration committee. This week, the Trump fans inauguration committee is on track to break a fundraiser record. As pledged contributions surpassed committee's goal of a 150,000,000 CNBC reported more companies are donating to Trump's inauguration because Trump has vowed to revamp US economic policy in a way that could benefit the favored few. Trump posted on social media in capital letters, everybody wants to be my friend. So I'm gonna talk about some examples of money. Before we do that, I just wanna step back. The main story from last week that we were discussing was ABC News settling with Trump. Didn't make a lot of sense. It had immediate repercussions of Trump ensuing the demoing register and their poster. But reporting this week from the Washington Post, Was that as Trump continues to ramp up his attacks at the media, that reportedly ABC and Disney executives, the reason they decided to settle in large part was because of his promised retribution. Again, wanting to curry favor, get on his good side. The network has 230 affiliated stations, and Trump has publicly threatened to pull federal licenses stations that broadcast news about him that he does not like. This is shocking. A shocking obey in advance. So that's one way. Okay? But then also, that's 15,000,000 from ABC News. It's not that thing. Also, corporations and individuals just writing checks. Ford Motor Company this week. Donated 1,000,000 in a fleet of vehicles. Trading platform Robert markets who obviously is trying to trade different things including cryptocurrency donated 2,000,000 as the highest that we've recorded so far. Uber and its CEO, Each donated a a 1,000,000. And hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, who has not been a Trump fan, was behind Thank you, Hailey. Also donated 1,000,000. The Wall Street Journal reported that at least 11 companies and trade associations that have Ledged. To withhold support from Trump. After January 6th. All of these companies said no more. After that happened. They are now donated to his inauguration committee. You can link to the stories and the list, but I'll talk about some of the names. AT and T, Bank of America, Stanley Black and Decker. For some, this is the first time they have donated to inaugural committee in more than a decade. And that list includes Goldman Sachs, Intuit, Toyota, and Pharma. So amazing, amazing amount of folks throwing money to curry favor with Trump. Or backing down ABC News, Washington Post, under Bezos, to obey in advance. Absolutely right. And then we also have the continuation, of course, of Trump just cashing in. On being president-elect. Unprecedented. Even, you know, in the 1st regime, Trump did put some limits on conflicts of interest and he did adopt an ethical guideline. But this time, the Washington Post is reporting he's continuing to profit off his presidency in an unprecedented way with the Trump working not his campaign, the Trump Organization, hosting a Trump store with Christmas gifts and keeping the proper It's called the 4547 collection. And it has a greater overlap between Trump's businesses and political activities than at any time during the president regime. So the amount of enriching himself and public very public pay for play is truly like nothing we have ever seen. 4. So, you know, and and it's not just him. The you know, we had Matt Getz. We had the ethics committee report come this week. This was Trump's first nominee for attorney general, finding that Getz had sex with a 17 year old in violation of of Florida's statutory rape law, regularly paid for sex, illegal drug use, accepted proper gifts, blah blah blah. Trump speak for the IRS. As of issues with soliciting clients to take advantage of pandemic era tax credits that had become a magnet for fraud, he's picked a guy for Navy secretary that has no experience in military because the guy's a money manager and lives down the street from him near Mar a Lago. The craziness is just continuing. And you know, notable. But watch these themes. Continue. The one is a pushback. Which we can be very grateful for. He's not going to get all his way. But he's coming from Republicans. And elected officials. It is corporate America is down there kissing the ring. Wealthy individuals are down kissing the ring. And why? Because, sadly, it works. It's like having a mafia boss as president. That's literally what's going to what's happening here. And the rest of us are gonna be left fighting the battle for our democracy, but that's okay. Like I said last week, we're good to go. We're gonna do it, folks. So I hope you all have a Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, whatever whatever holiday you are celebrating. This holiday season and a joyous New Year. If you are eliminating the amount of media you watch, this will catch you up with all you need to know. Please do take care of your mental health. Get ready for the fight. We'll be taking office in a few weeks, and we will be ready. Take care. Hi. It's Amos. This is in on The Weekly List, an author of the book. The List. And I'm devastated to welcome you back to the 2nd season. I don't know I'll come up with a name for it. Welcome back to a new era of Donald Trump. These are words I never thought I would be saying to you here again. I thought after January 6th, an attempted coup of our democracy, I fought after multiple convictions, in court that we were done. We were done with this man and his attempt to subvert our election to overthrow our democracy. Today is November 6th, 2024. I'm sad to say that did not turn out to be the case. History books will be written about what happened in this particular presidential race, but here we are 24 hours later, and I'll tell you what we know so far. When we spoke last, president Biden had stepped away from running for reelection after a disastrous debate and seeming too old. And his vice president, Pamela Harris, California. Had stepped in and had the party behind her, a lot of excitement and joy and hopeful behind her. She ran what I would consider to be a flawless campaign. She had a short runway, which certainly did not help, and she was not well known around the country, but I don't think we could have asked for anything more from a candidate set in that late in the race. And if we had had this conversation 24 hours ago, I would have told you when I had been saying she is going to win perhaps by a landslide. Even though every poll, section of one outlier in Iowa, said everything was close. Her campaign felt confident. She had expanded the map to 7 swing states. There was a path to us winning all seven. Trump in the last week, of the campaign closed terribly. His campaign was a lot less hopeful, and reportedly so was he. He was setting up to do what he had done in 20 20, which was to challenge the election. He was claiming fraud in Pennsylvania. They were starting their court cases. We thought we were gonna get a redo of 2020 with Trump losing, and calling it a fake election and all the rest. But that didn't happen. We actually lost, and it was a red wave, and it has shocked the country. And shocked all of us and shocked our spirit. We thought we were turning the page and following a message with Harris of Oak and of meeting the needs of people and listening to them opposed to retribution as opposed to self serving, as opposed to division and 8. It didn't turn out that way. Not only did we lose the presidency, lost the Senate. And the House votes are still being counted, but we might have lost control of all of it. This comes at a time when so much is at stake We are, after the last Trump presidency dealing with aftereffects of Dobbs being overturned, Roe v Wade being overturned, the Dobbs decision. Woman losing access to basic health needs We have been talking about project 202025 on this podcast and it being a road map for authoritarianism. It was all out there in the open. And let me tell you what the ending was, well, we've talked about the ending, but we didn't show up. Some of us worked super hard I was down in Pennsylvania, all over Pennsylvania, had Rally's thousands of you. Thank you to everyone who went to the 7 swing states. The last weekend in Pennsylvania, we were knocking 2,000 doors a minute The last weekend, we had hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the swing states knocking doors, phone banking, But at the end of the day, where we sit now and based on what we know Democrats couldn't be bothered to vote. Only of the electorate that showed up, only 32% were Democrats. 34% were independents. That's the first time in history. That independents have uptown Democrats in showing up on a presidential election he was to say a consequential presidential election. Republicans also came in at 34%. But I am struggling with, and we don't have the answers to what of why there was this apathy. Gonna talk about some of the this isn't a political podcast. This is podcast that deals with our potential descent into authoritarianism with the goal of making you aware so you can fight back and not feel gaslit. But what we do know is there was a major double standard once again it was sort of like our media learned nothing during this political season. When Biden was our candidate, all we heard about was cognitive decline. When Trump became the candidate, we stopped hearing about that. In the serious way the media had pursued Biden. When Hillary's emails were leaked or campaign emails were leaked in 2016, that became a major story that our media covered. Remember? Trump asked Putin to release rest of the emails Well, this time, Trump campaign was hacked. And our media made the decision Not too pursue There were other double standards too. You you know, to talk about. But, again, I I believe our media largely failed us until the very, very end saw some fear in their own eyes because they too are gonna be impacted by this. By by the then, it was too late. The landscape of our media has changed. That's something we talked about when I did the podcast the first time in the weekly list. But we have 2 billionaires that own 2 major newspapers, The Washington Post and The LA Times. And both billionaires refused to endorse Kamala Harris even though their editorial boards wanted to. The billionaire impact was also seen with Elon Musk who played an outsized and scary role in our election. One that I fear will have future repercussions. As we've talked about, he purchased what was Twitter, is now x and as a result, had this megaphone to speak to people, but also to control Narrative. Twitter was such an important part of what we used, but I used last time to communicate with people, to get the news from. It's a cesspool of 8. And he's switched the algorithm such that people that are amplified are people that he agrees with. He also through well over a 100,000,000 into the presidential race between what he donated and basically set up a ground game for Trump in states where he didn't have one. It got to the point where he offered a $1,000,000 A day. In a so called lottery, which wasn't really a lottery. To people that would sign his pledge that they even went to court in in Pennsylvania, but You what? So you see an outsized role of billionaires and you see Trump excuse me, Musk out now saying he's gonna stay involved. Gonna be involved in 2026. There was also a lot of you know, we talked about in 2016, the role of Russia in shaping disinformation, and that was present during this election again as was, you know, China trying to hack emails. Iran, But Russia played an outsized role in a lot of propaganda And on election day, calling in bomb threats. In key swing states in areas that were heavily African American, The FBI identified last night as we were hearing voting results that Russia was behind that. There was also a certain amount of fear, and I blame our media for this, that was banned, that it was gonna be scary to vote. It turned out, there was really nothing that happened during the election that was scary. But you know, I I wonder, and this is something we'll know better months from now, whether people were actually afraid to vote. There was apathy. There was a sense of complacency, maybe. But it might also be a bit of Stockholm syndrome that I just don't wanna be part of it. That I wanna be one of those nice girls in Hitler's Germany that didn't wanna make waves. To be determined. Hi. | 221.99308705329895 | 1093.1530870532988 |
| SPEAKER_02 | Say the wall street journal is owned by rupert murdoch. it's conservative, and it is. and their editorial board is notably like a fox news of boards. but their reporting side | 224.4762830734253 | 235.5962830734253 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Has some really strong reporting. and i linked to this article in the weekly list. they have an article that is well sourced that's a question whether biden has been experiencing cognitive decline | 235.59628319740295 | 248.09628319740295 |
| SPEAKER_2 | You know, here we are now, and we are going back into a new era of Trump. Without guardrails. There's been a supreme court decision which basically makes him unaccountable as soon as he turned president for any consequences. Our Department of Justice under Merrick Garland, it's something I was screaming about in this podcast, did not pursue Trump for January 6th. And for his other misdoings until it was really too late. By time Jack Smith was appointed, a clock had run out. So all the cases that we've talked about, all the wrongdoings and the convictions and the money he owes and the crimes, gonna get away Scott Free from all of them. And the other thing he hasn't done yet, but he probably will do, is pardon everyone involved in January 6 in trying to overthrow our democracy. So hard hard times are coming. I'm I'm telling people right now, if you're listening, gird your loins. You know, right now, it's not useful having done this project. To think about what he's going to do Because one thing I've learned, one of the many things I've learned following this man is he has no plan. He probably won't follow project 2025 because it's not his plan. He is erratic. He is spontaneous in a negative way. His he's able to be pushed his buttons pushed and do things. He's all over the place. It will not be a linear rise of Trump. We don't know what it will be like. It will be different. And whatever was the resistance will come back in some shape or form. So I really encourage people at this point to catch your breath to allow yourself to grieve, This was a shock to all of us. It felt like 2016 all over again. And be prepared. But also know that this time will be different. For the worst, most likely, yes. But also different. Now as for this project, I have a commitment to our democracy and writing these things down for history. And I know for a lot of you listening, seeing the weekly list had been a way to you know, let you know that you weren't going crazy, but you didn't imagine this stuff. And I do plan to do a form of it, I am Also, even shock that going back to this and that about this outcome, so I still need to plan give some thought to what it will look like. But a lot of the things that recovered in the 1st season or whatever word we're gonna use, that were not normal, now are normal. If you do one thing and you do it again, like, you run for election without providing your tax returns and without providing a health checkup to get away with it once, the next time it's a new | 1093.3930869102478 | 1310.433611910248 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So what this is going to look like next time? Sort of unfold as the weeks So know, start to tit. We've talked about some of the things that were not normal in these roles of 1,000,000,000 and our politics and how that will all play out. So stay tuned, and I will be eating up with a podcast of keep up with a list. And I wanna leave things just with A note of some reality, You all know I'm a realist. I I tend to be positive, and and I just need to say this out loud in a language | 1255.7431869506836 | 1341.7137119506835 |
| SPEAKER_2 | After Trump won in 2016, in 2018, | 1287.5630869865417 | 1347.4037119865418 |
| SPEAKER_1 | there was a blue wave | 1292.223186969757 | 1349.913711969757 |
| SPEAKER_2 | We took back the presidency in 2020. Biden was a great president. He did some very, you know, strong things for Democrats. And the pendulum swung back. I I believe, you know, people were unhappy with the status quo and want to blame Biden, and Harris was her vice president his vice | 1294.573086977005 | 1367.6337119770049 |
| SPEAKER_1 | norm. | 1310.4336121082306 | 1310.9336121082306 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But the pendulum will swing | 1313.0830869674683 | 1370.4237119674683 |
| SPEAKER_2 | People have forgotten. Bad things were under Trump. After a few months, they'll be reminded some of the crazy stuff he did during this election season Like, e saying that, the immigrants were eating cats and dogs in Ohio. The Haitian | 1315.9430871009827 | 1388.5937121009824 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that people can understand. | 1341.713711977005 | 1343.143711977005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | president. | 1367.7737119197845 | 1368.0237119197845 |
| SPEAKER_1 | again. | 1370.423712015152 | 1370.8837120151518 |
| SPEAKER_1 | immigrants saying Liz Cheney should be executed things like | 1389.133712053299 | 1393.1537120532992 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that. You know, it's our country will remember and things will start to not feel so good. Once he is our leader. And so 2026 will be a year of things swinging back. I I just want you to have a certain comfort of that. That our country has had | 1393.1537120342255 | 1410.6637120342255 |
| SPEAKER_0 | This helps distinguish imperialism in the Marxist or Lenin sense from the way it's often used in, you know, school or in common speech where it just means something like a stronger country taking over a weaker country. Right? We sometimes talk about the Roman Empire and Roman Imperialism in this vein. And, when it's used in this non Marxist sense, it's used in a sort of transhistorical way. That unties it from any particular mode of production. It's not to say that that isn't useful or there isn't a place for using imperialism in that way, But when we Marxists talk about imperialism, we mean something much more specific, and I think that's worth noting upfront | 1470.4740788936615 | 1502.0640788936616 |
| SPEAKER_1 | practical to call it monopoly capitalism in its imperialist stage or something like that. But, really, capitalism is, as we'll see, inevitably monopolistic and imperialist. The process of capitalism's historical evolution from its so called and somewhat fabricated stage of free enterprise to monopoly capitalism and then further into what we refer to as imperialism, was outlined both theoretically and empirically by black Vladimir Lenin well over a century ago. In his classic text, imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism. The connection between monopoly and imperialism might not seem quite straightforward to you at first, and an understanding of imperialism itself as a process grounded in political economy. May seem somewhat counterintuitive, especially if you're used to thinking of imperialism and empire in the popular sense of the words. But that's why we brought on 2 guests to walk us through this crucial text and help us make sense of it all. Alison Esquilante and Brent O'Shea are the hosts of red menace, a podcast that explains and analyzes revolutionary theory and then a original to talk about other texts by Lenin but also to explore a wide variety of topics from transliberation to revolutionary Buddhism. Brett is also the host of the terrific podcast, revolutionary left radio and shoeless South Dakota. In this episode, we unpack Lenin's imperialism, the highest of capitalism. This episode is an excellent introduction to the text, but it also takes a deep dive and gets granular at times. Picking apart the nuances and various interpretations of the text. We explore the historical context in which Lenin wrote this book and then trace capitalism's history from its early stages into its monopoly form. We explore how finance capital emerged and became similarly concentrated, how this merging of concentrated finance and industrial capital began to spread out from the capitalist countries to the periphery and began to carve up the world. And how this process led to what we now understand to be capitalism's final and highest stage, imperialism. And, of course, we also apply the text to a variety of current events and explore how we can apply Lenin's ideas in ways that help us grow strengthen our socialist movements globally.

| SPEAKER_0 | Upstream. Upstream. | 1505.624078989029 | 1506.2040769890289 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Upstream. A show about political economy and society that invites you to unlearn everything you thought you knew about the world around you. I'm Della Duncan. | 1506.664076089859 | 1514.414079089859 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And I'm Robert Greene. | 1514.414078950882 | 1515.634078950882 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Capitalist Imperialism. Monopoly. Far from being separate concepts that just happen to take shape parallel to one another or to overlap from time to time. These terms all really refer | 1516.014081954956 | 1528.0640789549561 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Alright. Oh, Brett and Alison it is such a pleasure to have you both back on the show. Yeah. The pleasure and honor is ours. For sure. Happy to be here. Yeah. Absolutely. Love it. Every time we get the chance to come on, I feel like we always have such wonderful discussions. So thanks so much. Yeah. Of course. I'm really excited to be having this particular discussion. And I know I say this every time, but you 2 have been such a huge influence for me in terms of, like, my growth and development as a Marxist and work that you both do with Red Menace and Brett with Revolutionary Left Radio, is really unparalleled. And I love the older episodes where you take deep dives into texts love the newer stuff where you're just sort of talking a little bit more about contemporary events It's all just really, really great stuff. And if anybody listening Has not yet checked out Red Menace or Revolutionary Left Radio, which I would be surprised if you haven't. But if you haven't, it's definitely time to go check out both of those shows and get lost in in their deep catalog of incredible episodes. For anybody who, you know, may not know you already, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit maybe introduce yourselves, and then I'm also really curious to just maybe get a sense of how Red Menace started. | 1703.6534540653229 | 1829.3640790653228 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Sure. Yeah. | 1774.0934739112854 | 1830.6340989112855 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I can start off, and I'll just say first off, like, yeah. It's a pleasure to be on. I really am impressed with what you've been able to do with with Upstream. Your presence on social media is always, you know, refreshing and powerful. And, know, we've gotten actually a lot of listeners that have heard us on previous episodes from Upstream. So we really appreciate that, and I I genuinely love what what you're doing with the show. And and, we share spirit. For sure, between our our different endeavors. Yeah. I'm I'm Brett. I'm the host of RevLeft Radio, cohost of Red Menace with my friend and comrade Allison. I also host a nonpolitical show about mental health and addiction called Shoeless in South And, yeah, very happy to be here. Red Menace. I mean, Allison might be able to say a little bit more about it, but from my perspective, back in, like, 2018, something like that, there was a a big conference in Colorado a socialist conference in Colorado, and we we had known each other from online before that, and we obviously resonated. And I think I had already had Allison on Rev left for one of our first episodes. So we had done some work together, but in Colorado, we got a chance to actually meet each other in person, hang out, was running another show at the time, called the guillotine, And after that conference, the guillotine kinda fell apart. And I was looking to do something new in that vacuum that, you know, the lack of guillotine created. I just remembered, like, me and Alison had a wonderful episode, and when we hung out in Colorado, it was so chill, so laid back. You know? Allison and I are very, very similar in a lot of ways. So it was the first person I thought of. Like, I'm gonna do something new. I'm gonna start a new endeavor. I wanted to be principal Marxism. I couldn't think of a better person than Allison. I reached out thought about it for a little bit and agreed, and then we've been, hit the ground running ever since. So I'm very, very blessed to be able to do this, with with Allison, somebody of of her intellectual and moral caliber. Also, Gabbel, I'm Allison. Thank you so much for all of that, Brad. And | 1830.6340990066528 | 1930.2140790066528 |
| SPEAKER_2 | yeah, thank you, Bobby, for having us on. I think | 1874.5534539222717 | 1932.4240789222717 |
| SPEAKER_4 | again, everything Brett said about Upstream is true, and I think our podcast have collaborated together, and it's been really awesome to have that opportunity I know one of the things that I really loved seeing, you know, the last few months was everyone's, like, Spotify wrapped with their top podcasts and seeing Upstream alongside the Rev podcasts on there was really cool to see. I just think we have, shared audience in a lot of ways, and I really | 1876.6834540367126 | 1951.4241090367127 |
| SPEAKER_4 | the stuff that you do. So thank you again for having us here. And, yeah, you know, I think Brett summarized it well. Red Minis, we, in the early days, pretty much just did focus on specific text, doing kind summary and analysis work. Since then, we've dipped into current events a little bit more, We tried to do some text still. Most recently, we did an episode on German revolution, so we're dabbling in kind of history as well. But, yeah, sort of all over the place, but it's been a great experience. Like Brett said, I think him and I hit it off pretty early on. He had me on RevLX Radio, and we talked about, what was it, state revolution, I think, and from there, just, like, really hit it off, and it took off. And, yeah, I could not ask for a better cohost. You know, we joke about | 1896.013433933258 | 1985.054078933258 |
| SPEAKER_4 | the time, but I think Brett and I are just remarkably similar ideologically and also just, like, temperamentally in a lot of ways. And it's it's really wild. So | 1929.4034540653229 | 1993.274079065323 |
| SPEAKER_2 | love | 1951.4241089820862 | 1951.754078982086 |
| SPEAKER_3 | this | 1985.0540790557861 | 1985.3040790557861 |
| SPEAKER_1 | get to the nuts and bolts of the theory and the analysis. So, yeah, I guess if you could talk a little bit about that context and and sort of, yeah, layout for us, like, the context in which the book was written. | 2060.5134930610657 | 2128.6274480610655 |
| SPEAKER_0 | In terms of applying the text to current events and stuff. But that episode is really good. It's what made me feel like I need to not only read the text, but I wanna do an upstream episode on this because it's just so important. And we've been talking much about imperialism for the last year or so since October 7, 2020 3, we've really been diving deep into this exploration of imperialism. And so, I couldn't think of 2 better guests to be having this conversation with and a more important text that we could be dissecting. And, of course, while you're listening to the old Red Menace episode from 20 18 on the same text, You might get lost in their back catalog and maybe binge a few dozen episodes or more, which is definitely what I tend to do. So go check that out. After you listen to this as well or maybe a couple weeks later if you wanna sort of refresh your mind with the material that we're talking about today from a slightly different set of angles. But for now, yeah, let's get into imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism written by the So And, yeah, I guess I think the best place to start would be to give a little bit of context | 2060.6074481010437 | 2125.597448101044 |
| SPEAKER_2 | For sure. Yeah. Absolutely. And I will say one thing up front. You mentioned the episode on imperialism on red menace. From 2018. I haven't listened to that episode in years, and I purposely didn't listen to it for this podcast. Because I wanted to come with a sort of fresh set of eyes you know, taking all the sort of knowledge that I've gained in the intervening years since we did that, text on red menace and try to give more contemporary examples and just kind of reapproach it without the baggage of of what I've already talked about in that episode. So hopefully, the end result is that these 2 episodes, while they're about the exact same facts, will still be noticeably significantly different, and we'll be attacking the text from different angles. To get, you know, as as big and as wide of a perspective on it. As we possibly can. But, yeah, let's get into the the context of the book. So imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism, it was written by Lenin in 16. So right away, we can see that this text emerges the context of an imperialist war, World War 1. And in the years leading up to the Russian revolution. At this time, capitalism had evolved from where it was during Marx and Engels' time, from industrial capitalism to monopoly capitalism. Which is to say imperialism. And that's like an obvious, but I think important point. The imperialism is not something that capitalism does or does not do. It is capitalism at a certain stage of development. This is why on the Marxist left will often use the phrase like capitalism imperialism. Right? Capitalism hyphen imperialism in our now process. And moreover, helps distinguish imperialism in the Marxist or Lenin sense from the way it's often used in, you know, school or in common speech where it just means something like a stronger country taking over a weaker country. Right? We sometimes talk about the Roman Empire and Roman Imperialism in this vein, And, when it's used in this non Marxist sense, it's used in a sort of transhistorical way. That unties it from any particular mode of production. It's not to say that that isn't useful or there isn't a place for using imperialism in that way, but when we mark talk about imperialism, we mean something much more specific, and I think that's worth noting upfront. But, you know, getting back to the context of the work, was writing at a critical juncture in the development of capitalism wherein European powers were expanding their empires into Africa and Asia and the global economy of markets, trade, and finance was growing like increasingly interconnected. The expanding empires were in large part about concentrated capital in what we now call the imperial core attempting to secure new markets, raw materials, and cheap labor. We will come back to all of these points later on and throughout this discussion for sure, that's the geopolitical context in which Lenin was writing. Namely during world war 1 and in this new stage of capitalism called imperialism. Now from a Marxist theoretical perspective, Lenin was building on the works of Marx and Engels, of course, extending their analysis to address the material conditions of the early 20th century, and updating Marxism using the tools of Marxism itself, namely historical and dialectical material And this is a crucial aspect of Marxism that we can never lose sight of. It is a living, evolving process that develops alongside the development of the it's attempting to comprehend and ultimately combat. So as cap capitalism itself evolves, as it manifests in different epochs and societies and conditions, so too does our analysis and our approach. And Lenin is like the perfect example of precisely this, and we learn not just from his particular analysis, but from the way in which he engages with and wields science scientific socialism in such a dynamic way. This highlights a kind of a core aspect of dialectical materialism and the evolution that it entails, and I kinda wanna touch on that really quick. It's something that the Maoist philosopher JMP calls continuity and rupture. Or what I increasingly kind of refer to as transcendence and inclusion. Lenin is continuing and including the core aspects of scientific socialism that Marx and Engels had discovered while at the same exact time, operating in a context that demanded that they be skillfully updated to ever evolving conditions. You know, history kind of works this way. Our own personal growth over our lifespans works this way. Evolution by natural selection works this way. And Marxism itself it's done properly, works this way. If it were not for this aspect of dialectical materialism, this ability to transcend an include, to simultaneously continue with and rupture from something prior. It would not be scientific and materialist, It would be Utopian and idealist. So understanding this work and the work of Lenin more broadly, it to also to understand this essential aspect of Marxism and to get to see it in practice. I think the importance and the beauty of that can't be overstated. So, like, kind of in a summary here, we we can understand this text as being produced by someone with a profound grasp of historical dialectical materialism theoretically as well as someone actively engaged in class struggle and revolutionary politics, uniting theory and practice masterfully, while at the same time updating Marxist analysis for a genuinely new stage capitalism's evolutionary development. Lenin was also, I think it's worth noting combating false and | 2072.886822938919 | 2402.677447938919 |
| SPEAKER_1 | out exactly what you're talking shit about. Thank you both so much, and Brett, thank you for underscoring the importance of understanding imperialism and empire in a Marxist sense and this text is being an important opportunity for us to move beyond the common understanding of those words, which doesn't really point to the significance of sort of the form of imperialism as a stage of capital of capitalism itself. I remember a few months back, I met Abby Martin, and, she was telling me that when she tells some people that she has a show called The Empire Files, they are very confused about what she means by empire and sometimes they think that she has a show on, like, Star Wars or something. It gets important for us to sort of reclaim, in a sense, those words and really imbue them with the Marxist meaning that they need to have if they're actually gonna be utilized in a skillful way that helps us analyze what's going on. What what what what a superstructural, Victor, | 2505.515897989273 | 2613.946522989273 |
| SPEAKER_0 | One, most of the socialist parties across Europe and across the world had opposed the war, but over time, we saw this trend and the shift towards actual support for the war, national chauvinism, patriotism becoming the primary form that these social parties took in our episode that we just released on the German revolution, we looked at how this becomes the divide within the SDP that eventually splits it into revolutionary and reformist factions. And so I think that is throughout the text. Right? You hear Lenin just constantly insulting the SDP, and much of his leadership throughout this, and there's this overwhelming kind of theory within a moment of crisis itself, where now that imperialism has really ruptured, Lenin has this very special vantage point to be able to see what caused that rupture and sort of its aftereffects. I think it is interesting how much of the moment it's written in is just kind of intertwined with the text, really. So that's that's the only thing I'll add. I think you gestured quite well to that, but I I feel like it's such an important part of this. And you're reading this and you don't know that history, you're gonna be like, why is he just insulting random Germans left and right? But that is kind of what is going on there. Yeah. That's that's a lot | 2505.6665229797363 | 2562.9465229797365 |
| SPEAKER_2 | common American understanding of imperialism be like star star wars. You know? It's like that. | 2559.085897922516 | 2619.716512922516 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And so, Brett, you definitely touched on this in your response But, Allison, I'd I'd love to turn to you and ask if you could maybe build on some of | 2565.6058979034424 | 2628.381522903442 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Brett just explained for us and maybe help us take a 20,000 foot look here before we get more granular into the text and just explain what Lennon was talking about in the text and what does monopoly have to do with imperialism. | 2572.645903110504 | 2640.9365231105044 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Totally. Yeah. Building off of what threat said, I think an important thing to recognize is that this notion of imperialism is already a concept that's pretty popular at the time that Lenin writes this text. Right? And you can see that throughout. He's citing other people's definitions of imperialism. Imperialism and really engaging with a discussion that already exists within these studies of political economy. And I think in many ways, if we wanna understand the 20,000 foot view, This is a text that, as I think Brett really alluded to, is contesting some of the stuff definitions. Right? So at the beginning of 20th century, we can think about other things things like William James, for example, who frame themselves as anti imperialist but for whom imperialism really is like a moral failure. Right? And Imperialism is liberalism failing to live up to its own values. You know, he refers to it as a kind of brutishness that ends up becoming dominant in liberal societies that is at odds with what is the morally correct thing to do. And I think here, Lenin really trying to say, no. Actually, if we wanna understand imperialism, you know, unfortunately, we have to do political economy. Right? We have to understand the conditions that produce imperialism. And so this text compares to a lot of Lenin's other texts, really is a work of political economy. And I think the moment you open that, you see it because it's just full of economic charts and graphs. Kind of depicting empirical economic data in order to develop this. I think that is really, like, where the text is coming from, and Linen is very interested interested, as Brett kind of alluded to already, in this predict of capitalist political economists had been that markets that were more or less uninhibited by interference would trend towards competition In reality, globally across the world, Lenin shows data indicating that we haven't seen competition be the form that markets have taken, but Central has become the predominant form. And this kind of actually makes sense Right? The profit drive within capitalism really this incredible incentive for decentralization. You know? To just quote Lenin very briefly, briefly. Right? He says, quote, cartels come to an agreement on the terms of sales. Dates of payment, etcetera. They divide the market among themselves. They fix the quantity of goods to be produced, and they fix the prices. They divide the profits among the various enterprises, etcetera. And it would make sense that this was where capitalism would go. Right? This is actually kind of a rational economic development out of the way that markets function in the first place. And so the first thing that London's interested in from this 20,000 foot view is this shift towards centralization. And the shift towards centralization for Lenin is important because this company company by one other emerging factor, which is the rise of finance capital. So, obviously, you know, I I think it would be silly to pretend, like, this period of time is where banks first come into existence. But rather, Lyndon's pointing out that banks undergo this transformation at this time. Right? He refers to banks originally as these middlemen for making payments that these cartels would have relied upon to manage their money for them and have a place to put the money that they were extracting through the production of commodities and and the other forms of productive capital that they're engaged in. But this transformation occurs here. Right? Instead of banks just becoming these sort of store houses for monies who facilitate transfers, they begin to actually profit. They begin to invest that money, both domestically and abroad, and begin to actually exercise power themselves. And so for Lenin, this creates this very interesting situation actually where the banks now have a power that the productive capitalists don't have. They have the power of investment. They have the power of all of this liquid capital on hand. That they're able to use as they please. And the banks themselves actually then do the same thing that the productive cash capitalists did. They trade towards monopoly. They start to acquire each other. They start to form into banking. And they start to exercise power in these really centralizing ways. And this ultimately gives them power both over productive capital and the state. Can control productive capital through what Lenin calls the share system, where they acquire shares and companies and are able to exercise control as they please, but they can also control the state through the economic power that they've gained in many ways. And so society for Lenin kind of becomes subservient to this finance capital during this period of time. So all of this eventually leads to a situation where finance capital is driving political and economic reality within these imperialist societies. And where the export of capital by these finance institutions leads to a kind of dividing up of the world into various spheres of influence and different states competing for those spheres of influence. It it's very notable that a lot of early imperialist conquest was about securing trade rights in exclusive trade rights to certain parts of the world where these financial institutions could then essentially be able to engage in investment of capital and then extraction of resources through the process of colonial as And so what starts as the concentration of, you know, productive capital into monopolies is the move away from free competition suddenly turns into an entire structure of global domination, exploitation, extraction, movement of capital across lines, and eventually wars for control over these various spheres of influence. And again, this makes sense. Lenin is writing as one of these great wars taking place as World War 1 explodes because of these ties and these conflicts. That these empires have engaged in. And so for Lenin, what's really important here is imperialism isn't a moral failure. It's not some aberration from within capitalism, but it's actually the inevitable result of the way that markets trend towards centralization overall. So those kind of my stab at a 20,000 foot view. Obviously, we will be getting into more details, but broadly, that is what these texts are doing. | 2585.6958980560303 | 2932.1465230560307 |
| SPEAKER_2 | what | 2628.3815228939056 | 2628.4665228939057 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I would just add to that that that's really well said and just kinda looking at the way we're going through this in general, I just wanna let people know that I think there will be times when Alison and I kind of go back over some of the same things, but I think it's particularly important when it comes to political economy, which can be difficult for people that have little to no training economics or political economy at all to grapple with. So when we repeat some of these things or or say some of these things in different ways, I think that repetition is Really crucial to learning and to help people really comprehend what it is we're talking about. Because admittedly, if you don't have any, you know, sort of familiarity with this text or with political economy more broadly, you know, some of these things be kind of difficult to to grapple with. So hopefully by repeating these things, coming at them from different angles, flushing them out in different ways, It'll be helpful listeners to really, really get a good grip on on what we're we're talking about here. But, yeah, Allison did an expert job as always. | 2876.5658979415894 | 2981.6065229415894 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. Yeah. Totally. That's a a really important point, Brett. And, Allison, yeah, thank you so much for the great encapsulation of, I guess, you could call the thesis of the text there. And I think you you underscored pretty well, you know, how this process of imperialism sort of begins with monopoly or the concentration of productive capital as you say. Yeah. And just definitely sort of going off of what Brent just said there, I think it would be helpful for us to maybe get more granular now and take these pieces apart now that we have a little bit of a encapsulated idea of Lennon's thesis. So let's get a little bit deeper into monopoly. And, of course, we'll be talking about monopoly throughout here, but I'm gonna read, a paragraph on quote. From the book itself. There's a a passage early in the text here and I'll ask you then to reflect on it. So the quote goes, 50 years ago, when Marx was writing capital, free competition appeared to most economists to be a, quote, natural law. The official scientists tried by conspiracy of silence to kill the works of Marx which by a theoretical and historical analysis of capitalism showed that free competition gives rise to the concentration of production. Which in turn, at a certain stage of development, leads to monopolies. | 2925.7858979701996 | 3051.8065229701997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Today, | 2996.595897912979 | 2997.095897912979 |
| SPEAKER_1 | monopoly has become a fact. The economists are writing mountains of books in which they describe the diverse manifestations of monopoly and continue to declare in chorus that Marxism is | 2997.2658479213715 | 3063.2665229213717 |
| SPEAKER_1 | but facts are stubborn things as the English proverb says. And they have to be reckoned with. Whether we like it or not. The facts show that differences between capitalist countries in e. G, in the matter of protection or free trade, only give rise to insignificant variations in the form of monopolies or in the moment of their appearance. And that the rise of monopolies as the result of a concentration of production is a general fundamental law in the present stage of capitalism. End quote. So Lenin was writing this during a period in which he was maybe just about a a decade or so past with his analysis shows to be this period of capitalism that sort of shifted from sort of mercantile capitalism from the, like, lots of smallholders and more like free competition into this stage of monopoly which is the predominant form of arrangement which is sort of what we're all used to and what we all experienced in our experiences of capitalism. So I'm wondering if you can walk us through What came before monopoly capitalism in a little bit more detail and | 3007.5358979701996 | 3130.7465229701997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | refuted | 3063.266522884369 | 3063.516522884369 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Development capital. Points to the core of the issue. Production has been concentrated. But let's go back to the beginning and start there and and work our way. To the price. So over capitalism develop, we start by being a presheritable, which is idealized, almost theoretical version of capitalism laid out by Adam. I think there, incidentally, who I later would glorify to how capitalism has played out in the real world. But Adam Smith's capitalism it was the capitalism of a small town. The rule. Unfortunately, for us today, many people, as I said, have been trained to think that this is true capitalism, when in fact, it is a fantasy version of capitalism that cannot actually exist as the predominant form of capitalism at the time. And why can't it exist as the predominant form of capitalism? Precisely because | 3177.5130701065063 | 3234.7130691065063 |
| SPEAKER_0 | The competition Mhmm. Through victories in the market merger acquisitions, economies of scale, etcetera. For a contemporary example of this process, we can look at something like Amazon. As Amazon won more and more of the market, its increasing size, scale, and wealth made such victories easier and easier. All real competition was obliterated by competition itself. Eventually, Amazon is so big commands so much of the market, is so powerful, operates on such a large scale that it cannot be compete with at all. So ironically enough, the competition that limited the free market eventually result in the diminishment and even obliteration of competition itself. A free market gives birth to an unfree one, inexorable. A competitive market gives rise to an uncompetitive one, inexorable. Why no scrappy mommy ever hope to compete with Amazon or Walmart, or Fire. And this lack of competition gives Amazon and the others protection from the of a truly free competitive market. This monopolization of market make Amazon so big and powerful and important to the overall economy that it can then, among many other things, intervene directly into the political | 3281.0644750595093 | 3347.9844750595094 |
| SPEAKER_1 | control on protecting it even more from any forces that might threaten This process occurs everywhere capitalism takes root and is only a matter of time since, again, the logic that produces it is embedded in the core of this itself. Once such monopolies or shared monopolies have formed this way through capitalism's development, these monopolies see to leverage with a plan for for profit accumulation and accumulation. This takes the form of cartels, trusts, syndicates. Basically, and to solidify their positions, control production, limit competition further, stabilize or fix prices, etcetera. The development of these monopolies represent the concentration capital or the centralization in specific sectors of the economy. Again, think Walmart, Amazon, or Microsoft today. Any industry or sector you look at in the American economy today, you will see the | 3281.1438500881195 | 3386.2944750881197 |

And yet, here's the interesting part. That's not at all the message that the world for sending to the millions. The millions are flying into our country. The message then was the opposite. We welcome you. We will stop your childbearing, whatever it takes. Even if we have to take baby formula from America since citizens, we will help you. That's literally what they're saying. And more to point that what they're doing. So how do you get the Biden administration to pay attention to American citizens? Do you? Let's see. Maybe before you can't get into Biden doesn't care if that Fiddler's body How do you get them to awaken to the fact that you exist, that American children are suffering? Well, turns out there is a way to do The baby formula shortage, and we look this up, like every crisis in this country may affect you. But it affects trans people disproportionately because trans people are always in the right offices, are the ones who suffer most. And as congresswoman Cory Bush once told us, nothing is more important than protecting birthing people. I speak before you today as a single mom as a nurse | -4.030627000000007 | 140.31 |
| SPEAKER_2 | as an activist, and as a congresswoman. And I am committed to prove the absolute most to protect black mothers, to protect black babies, to | 84.569375 | 147.72 |
| SPEAKER_1 | put | 147.72 | 147.97 |
| SPEAKER_2 | protect black birthing people. | 92.38936499999998 | 149.91000000000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Oh. I was the last line that's gonna get your vibe's attention. So your kids don't have enough to eat. They can't be bothered to help at all, so they cause this problem. But once Joe Biden finds out that the trans community is suffering, once he sees the basis of that suffering, he will do all he can to help He'll airlift those pallets of formula from the border and distribute to many American trans mothers who need them. Once he sees these faces, and here they are, these children straight from the Calvin Klein at pregnant men, The pregnant man emoji, Joe Biden. Do it for the pregnant man emoji. Okay. So therein is the masterclass in reactionary mystification, obscurantus, | 150.61 | 189.09 |
| SPEAKER_3 | and scapegoating of the phone. In the face of a capitalist induced crisis. So the fuck does Tucker Carlson blame for the shortage? First, he says an interesting term, government. So not a court corporate capture of our government, who was supposed to stand in opposition ideally to capital, but the monopoly this is a classic libertarian point, that, you know, anybody that's a libertarian over the last several decades heard here's all the time. Whenever there is a failure of capitalism, it is an immediate shift onto government. Government bad. What that does over time is delegitimize delegitimize the very idea of the government of the state as a mechanism that, I don't know, can control and regulate capital, can actually take care of its people. So by by by shifting it able to are engaging in this sort of libertarian, attack on the state as such. On the power of the state. Now COVID confusing. Of course, the AT choice legislation or whatever they personally like. But when it comes to taking care of our own citizens, investing in in health care, investing in, childcare, investing in anything. Anything that larger. In I would say indirect. He doesn't come out and say that Wick other are the reason for this, but in his government, what he's doing is he's putting something that is red meat for the conservative base. People already people on welfare, they have a very racialized idea of who is on welfare. Program's bad. WIC is bad, you know. And so there's a shift onto that as well. So the demonizing of Wick indirectly is still there. Then he goes on to blame | 133.93938500000002 | 320.28000000000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | in the | 320.42 | 321.40000000000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Okay. Now there are still, as we all know, you know, and even though when the Democrats win the shut the fuck up about it, concentration camps at the borders, order | 265.76935499999996 | 274.84937499999995 |
| SPEAKER_4 | to get food in | 333.13 | 333.75 |
| SPEAKER_3 | and resources to that relatively compared to the American population, smaller American. So a couple pallets go down to immigrant and concentration camps at the border. And now this is used And what does he of course, you know, some liberal elites, Bette Midler, who whoever the fuck. Can when the right talks about elites, they don't mean the capitalist fucking class. Right? They mean they're political enemies. People with some money or some social capital or some power on the liberal side of things. Those are Tucker Tucker Carlson's not | 277.769375 | 398.27000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | an elite. | 398.27000000000004 | 398.86 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Right? Right? Even though he's the heir to the Swanson fortune. Donald Trump isn't an elite. And, no, he's never talked about as an elite even though he's a rich kid from a real estate magnate. Right? These are all fucking elites. So they can't talk about elites as this upper echelon of people with wealth and power because that | 343.439375 | 413.97 |
| SPEAKER_4 | would include | 413.97 | 414.47 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So the elites have to be fucking I don't know. College professor, Liberals on MSNBC. Right? So you see how he does? That for weak mothers, immigrants, the government as | 359.179375 | 424.92 |
| SPEAKER_2 | a whole, | 424.92 | 425.71000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | in | 486.82937499999997 | 487.32937499999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | other of people | 588.0394049999999 | 665.6999999999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that I've never quite seen in my life on the left and the right, about American military interventions abroad. For my entire life, the the party has been Republican party has been hostage to neocons, and has always been, you know, a free for all for the defense contract American empire, etcetera. This America's first populous energy coming out of the Republican right is calling that into question, which I think is ultimately just in and of itself. A good thing. And there is this move by the new right. We we can talk about it later. I mean, we're I think we're gonna do a gorilla history, in intelligence brief on it. But the new right, this realignment that rejects right wing libertarian economics but embraces social conservatives and basically saying, we want a social democratic Steve, but with very strong borders with the state that enforces socially conservative domestic policy and that keeps out and turned it into weapons and money and Funds for until they eventually inevitably, the conflict. What funneling weapons shit does nothing. To protect Ukrainians It just prolongs the bloodshed and there's the the obstinance from NATO, from the US, and from Ukraine To not what it wants, which is fundamentally a neutral Ukraine, it made her to back the fuck up. I'm gonna get into Sweden. | 714.159375 | 896.67 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Fiddle. | 841.649375 | 842.149375 |

| SPEAKER_4 | I | 889.669415 | 889.8293749999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | mean, depending on your definition, we could say we're | 945.81 | 948.37 |
| SPEAKER_4 | in | 948.37 | 948.5 |
| SPEAKER_3 | a regional war based on the fact that Israel is bombing all of its neighbors and conducting a genocide.

In order to deter an Iranian attack and For some of them, there is a sort of | 892.8393749999999 | 977.54005 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. Okay. | 1143.7550849999998 | 1200.21571 |
| SPEAKER_1 | For using nukes if they're losing the war. | 1200.3757099999998 | 1203.1357099999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Wow. | 1147.5600849999998 | 1147.9650849999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That was my understanding of | 1148.835085 | 1206.255706 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. | 1206.255706 | 1207.2157049999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You're | 1207.2157049999998 | 1207.3756999999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you're prob | 1207.3756999999998 | 1207.6157099999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | you're | 1207.69571 | 1208.01571 |
| SPEAKER_1 | right. | 1208.01571 | 1208.0957099999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I don't know anything | 1208.0957099999998 | 1208.8156999999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | about those two | 1208.8156999999999 | 1209.6257099999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | So, like, you know more than I do for sure. And that sounds about right, like, in this situation. | 1154.285085 | 1216.66571 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Sounds | 1163.275085 | 1163.7050849999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | thank you for enlightening me because I don't know. I don't know anything about it. So this is a | 1164.025085 | 1231.6157099999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Invaded and toppled and destroyed That's why they they explained. They just explained You know, if Iran has precursors | 1267.196324 | 1276.519658 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and was able to, like, I | 1276.786324 | 1278.676324 |
| SPEAKER_0 | doing everything the discussion for the last several decades about trying to prevent Iran from having used is precisely for the scenario. | 1279.2363249999999 | 1285.0863239999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I | 1285.6263239999998 | 1285.786324 |
| SPEAKER_0 | don't know the scenario. What? | 1285.786324 | 1287.2463249999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It | 1287.7413239999998 | 1287.8563239999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | bulla. And so there's a sense in which if Iran has this extra layer, not only would you if you start a proper war with Israel where you have to take on Israel, which is doable. I mean, all the regional partners could come together to some extent and and very likely defeat Israel. I mean, I think it there's no question if Iran and Hezbollah teamed up | 1289.776324 | 1312.046326 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It's Hezbollah. From | 1312.2396589999998 | 1312.426324 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yemen and obviously you | 1312.426324 | 1314.6063239999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you I think it's just | 1314.696324 | 1316.456324 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the | 1316.456324 | 1316.756324 |
| SPEAKER_2 | faction of militant militant groups there that are against the US. And the core. | 1317.3963239999998 | 1323.026324 |
| SPEAKER_1 | terror No. No. | 1267.2257009999998 | 1324.696324 |
| SPEAKER_0 | No. They're I don't believe that they are. | 1324.696324 | 1326.536324 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. | 1326.536324 | 1326.696324 |
| SPEAKER_0 | They're definitely I | 1326.696324 | 1327.496324 |
| SPEAKER_1 | think | 1327.496324 | 1327.716324 |
| SPEAKER_0 | they're maybe the government or, like, a government type deal, or, like, leaders of this. I don't know. I don't honestly don't know for sure, but, no, they're not it's not a place Okay. Even though he said Iran and Hezbollah. But it's because because Hezbollah is, in Lebanon. That's why is that's what as Israel was using as the excuse for, invading and bombing Lebanon like they have been. And they still | 1271.7356989999998 | 1353.6063239999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | are. | 1353.6063239999999 | 1354.1063239999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Because Hezbollah is now is is deemed a terrorist But it's because they want fucking Israel to stop doing what they're doing to Palestinians. At least they're trying to do something. | 1302.305699 | 1367.3563239999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Else is. | 1311.535699 | 1368.266324 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Alright. | 1312.585699 | 1313.085699 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, what do you mean? Like, you're you're killing innocent people, and now they're terrorists? Israel's not terrorists. Like, it's not | 1313.505704 | 1376.8363239999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | And you | 1377.156324 | 1377.3963239999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | all must have assumed that rape in their bodies? | 1377.3963239999998 | 1379.906319 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Mhmm. Like, I don't know how this is, like, a thing, and it grows into it grosses me out so much, but they had it they have dogs race, the men. How does that even hap like, what? How do you just sick a dog to do that to a wait, | 1379.906319 | 1340.4656989999999 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Kinda fucking training? Like, what the fucker | 1341.925699 | 1400.3463239999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is probably a sick motherfucker. | 1400.3463239999999 | 1401.806324 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Like, how do you that's just I don't even I don't even wanna think about that, but yeah. Do | 1346.2256989999998 | 1406.1463239999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you have the gorilla war on behalf of Hamas in the Palatine? That's crazy. Poor | 1406.1463239999998 | 1356.795699 |
| SPEAKER_2 | animals. And | 1412.776324 | 1358.9856989999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | person, | 1414.966324 | 1415.4463139999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | of | 1415.4463139999998 | 1415.686324 |
| SPEAKER_3 | course. | 1415.686324 | 1415.8463239999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But, | 1415.8463239999999 | 1416.006324 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, he's sick. | 1416.006324 | 1417.786324 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And so they know a war with Israel also means a war with the United States. And the nuclear the nuclear asymmetry is a real problem. Like, Iran should have nukes. In all of the discussion for the last several decades about trying to prevent from having to do precisely for this scenario, When when Israel is finally able to be the rabid beast that wants to be regally, wants to escalate into a regional war, not a fucking world war. Apocalyptic war. And they know that they have nukes, and they've been doing everything with the US to prevent Iran from getting nukes because that is the ultimate | 1364.1956989999999 | 1458.046334 |
| SPEAKER_1 | deterrence. | 1402.4457089999999 | 1402.5256989999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | The | 1458.506324 | 1458.6663239999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | only reason, as we | 1458.6663239999998 | 1459.466334 |
| SPEAKER_1 | all | 1459.466334 | 1459.626334 |
| SPEAKER_4 | know, why North Korea hasn't been invaded and | 1459.626334 | 1462.3463339999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | toppled | 1462.3463339999998 | 1462.506324 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and | 1462.506324 | 1462.906334 |
| SPEAKER_4 | gutted. | 1462.906334 | 1463.3863239999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That | 1408.125699 | 1408.365709 |
| SPEAKER_3 | is true. | 1464.3463339999998 | 1464.8263339999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, we've never, like, since since we fucking killed off, like, a fifth of their population or whatever, and they they've now got nukes. | 1464.8263339999999 | 1472.736324 |
| SPEAKER_3 | We | 1472.736324 | 1472.986324 |
| SPEAKER_2 | really have not even, like situation | 1472.986324 | 1475.536324 |
| SPEAKER_1 | now. We know | 1476.156334 | 1476.216334 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Don't | 1476.236334 | 1476.736334 |
| SPEAKER_1 | know. It is | 1476.876334 | 1478.406324 |
| SPEAKER_2 | definitely a | 1478.406324 | 1479.4463139999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | deterrent. | 1479.4463139999998 | 1479.9463139999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | To prevent this exact scenario by, among many other things, assassinating physicists, the top scientists who are working on or have knowledge | 1424.415699 | 1432.915699 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to | 1488.8963239999998 | 1489.3963239999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | produce nuclear weapons in that way. So it's clearly been a long standing strategy on behalf of Israel and the United States to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons for precisely this reason, For this ultimate asymmetry when push comes to ultimate shove, Israel has nukes and Iran doesn't. And and Iran you know, any rational actor has to take that | 1489.696324 | 1513.8263339999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. It's fucking | 1471.585699 | 1528.6063239999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | crazy. | 1528.6063239999999 | 1529.1063239999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | They're getting | 1474.535699 | 1531.1763039999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the thumbs up with | 1531.3963239999998 | 1532.036324 |
| SPEAKER_2 | at every | 1532.3563239999999 | 1532.9363239999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | turn. | 1533.236304 | 1533.736304 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. United, like, in Snakes of America. That was funny. | 1488.845679 | 1549.056324 |
| SPEAKER_4 | On the right side of history. And Israel is a rabid dog. That's conducting a genocide in bombing its neighbors. It's the number one threat 2, to freedom, to safety, to stability in the region. As it presents itself as the only democracy in the most moral army and, you know, we're outposts for western civilization. Yeah. | 1498.055699 | 1574.9363239999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Because it can't live as equals. See itself as, you know, even internally equal amongst people in the sense of, like, versus Arab Muslims in in Palestine, in historic Palestine. 2nd class, 3rd class, 4th class citizen. The class. Like, you can't say 3rd class. It is they're being genocided. In the worst possible imaginable way. Of Israeli settler colonial factions and So that's that that violence and that destabilization serves the US and interest, which is but also this proves that Israel is the problem. And that region can never know peace | 1609.5465808 | 1662.346581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | takeover of a historic Palestine and a know, aggressive escalatory Militancy against any neighbor country that tries to prevent it or has different ideas about how things should go? So this is gonna continue to escalate. And, you know, the US it's it's one of those things where you know, all for all this talk of democracy, we had no fucking choice when it comes to war. There's no candidate that we can choose that has a reasonable chance of winning. | 1606.810959 | 1692.386585 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That you've seen | 1649.005956 | 1705.616581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You know, 10 plus months. Of a brutal genocide that the democratic party is arming arguing in favor of protecting at the UN slandering its opponents to your home as the democratic party tax dollars go. We close at 5, $7,000,000,000,000 spent on Iraq and Afghanistan alone. That's all the money that should go to investments America for America, where people are homeless, people are struggling for housing, people are struggling for health care, they have to take on 10,000 and all the fucking problems that our tax dollars could be used to invest in endless wars abroad. That has to come to a motherfucking end, and clearly, democracy does Democracy. System is so hot and paid for. On multiple levels. The military industrial complex is a campaign, ousted Cory Bush, one of the only And because she had table of options. And they call this democracy. So it's a disgusting situation. Israel needs to be put down. Is a rabid dog. US is a rabid dog. Imperialism is the core contradiction. There is no decent future for humanity as long as imperialism can continue to run amok around the world And what does imperialism systematic sanctioning plundering, colonial, and neocolonial looting, of the global South Korea. Well, that tends to create a whole thing we call mass migration. A little thing we call a destabilization of somebody's home country to such an extent that where they're desperately now any possibility of opportunity in those people's homes countries. One of the things you'll often hear, America is the greatest country in the world. If if they weren't, then why is | 1650.725956 | 1881.701581 |
| SPEAKER_2 | everybody | 1881.701581 | 1881.866581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | wanna come here? Because you fuck everywhere else up. Yeah. | 1826.125956 | 1830.975956 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's | 1887.256581 | 1887.756581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And so, yeah, there's opportunities here, not because they grow out as a virtue of American society and and civic association. But precisely because of imperial and neocolonial plunder. I mean, for the imperial court more broadly. I mean, look at, you know, from Venezuela, we see Venezuelan economic migrants, Central American economic migrants, We see migrants from the Syrian Civil War that have been flooding into Europe for a long time. | 1835.845976 | 1921.096581 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Oh. Afghanistan | 1921.096581 | 1921.836581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Iraq, the entire region that is destabilized by the US by its allies in Europe, and by Israel creating mass migration into Europe as desperate people lead destruction and poverty and move towards an area that have some ostensible opportunities even though those are completely dried up now. And then what happens? You get a fascist backlash. In those home countries against the migrants themselves. For all the fucking people rioting and all the people across the West hating immigrants fuming about being replaced and coming up with conspiracy theories about a small cabal of people orchestrating the replacement of white genocide | 1867.2459760000002 | 1961.566581 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Do any of them | 1905.905976 | 1962.766601 |
| SPEAKER_1 | talk? About imperialism? About near communism? About the conditions that create desperate people fleeing desperate situations. Do they ever talk about that? No. There's no anti imperialist critique on the fascist | 1962.766601 | 1979.7465809999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | rights. | 1979.7465809999999 | 1980.126581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Support our troops. | 1932.135956 | 1989.176581 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Stand behind them or stand in front of them. Love it or leave it. These colors don't run. That's all we heard. And then they have the audacity to act surprised when there's huge migrations of desperate people, And then instead of blaming the warmonters or the rich and powerful elite, who orchestrate imperialism when it's become a reality itself as an object of critique The powerless moneyless migrants and whatever faction not the whole ruling class, but whatever faction of the ruling class that you've been trained | 1933.485956 | 2029.776581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And another layer | 1976.695956 | 2033.816561 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Really? | 1979.2459760000002 | 1979.7459760000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Actual solutions | 2035.946601 | 2037.006581 |
| SPEAKER_3 | to the problems of people who are upset about mass Mike the actual solutions are twofold. Anti imperialist politics ending this score to own humanity? Of of imperial hegemony and wars, etcetera. And socialist economics in inside of countries so that every country can have a toothpaste that they have prosperity. Share that prosperity widely. So people are not | 1982.3959559999998 | 2062.086551 |
| SPEAKER_1 | living in constant austerity, constant precarity, have crumbling social services, have no fucking life opportunities, have no way to generate a decent income, have no future at all. But guess what? | 2062.086551 | 2073.566561 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Those things have been denigrated as communists and socialists. So if you go into one of these fucking geese's over in England rioting and fucking attacking people of color. And you | 2018.145936 | 2085.586581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | said, hey. The real solution here if you care about this issue, the real solution here is socialist economics at home and anti imperialist politics abroad. You know? Bridged together by a proletarian internationalism where where the working people have every country see themselves in the working people of other countries, and we try to create a world that works for regular working people across the world. They would call that in the past, they would call it a commie red menace know, whatever bullshit. Now they call it woke. Right? They would call that woke. Or socialism or communism tyranny. And so the thing that's creating the problem | 2085.586581 | 2126.376581 |
| SPEAKER_3 | brutal capitalism at home, anti imperialism abroad, create one of its effects is to create desperate | 2071.195956 | 2133.226581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | fleeing desperate conditions, which gives rise to | 2078.265956 | 2136.006581 |
| SPEAKER_3 | mass migration. And then the solutions to that problem | 2136.006581 | 2140.776581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | which are to address the root causes of imperialism and brutal capitalism, are then denigrated by the the reactionary elements of the ruling class. To their to their ordinary working class constituency denigrated as communist as socialist as woke. As tyranny, as whatever. And so you see this incredible bind that we are in. And you see how the | 2085.195956 | 2111.195956 |
| SPEAKER_3 | ruling class apparatus and its ideological programming literally allows only for fascism to be the trajectory that people can take. The real solution striking at the root | 2167.1765809999997 | 2179.416581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | are denigrated as socialist | 2123.915926 | 2181.256581 |
| SPEAKER_3 | and communist, anaphyla. | 2181.256581 | 2182.476581 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I don't know why it just, like, picked out right there. | 2130.7459559999998 | 2189.006581 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Haven't been eating. I've just been eating people. That too. I just go home, but I | 2218.880707 | 2223.4107067 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't tell them. It doesn't | 2223.4107067 | 2224.6907069999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | seem like a | 2224.6907069999997 | 2225.550707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | year | 2226.030707 | 2226.350707 |
| SPEAKER_3 | we have. I've just been chasing the rebel. But yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I can be wrong about that for sure. Like, I probably died because, not I don't think I have, like, not died at all because I was pretty sure I died on those purple guys. But that was my 2nd life, so I must have, like, had at least 2 things. So what was it? | 2226.350707 | 2244.180707 |
| SPEAKER_4 | When you do | 2260.5007069999997 | 2261.140707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that, | 2261.140707 | 2261.640707 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you are directly supporting the ruling | 2263.030707 | 2265.270704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | class. | 2265.270704 | 2265.770704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | When you either hit | 2267.300707 | 2270.080707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yep. Or you take the bachelors route of scapegoating worthless, desperate people as the cause of your problem. In either of those two cases, what you are doing is you are doggedly serving the interest of the ruling elites. Because factionalism, they can play all day. They love factionalism. They the ruling class wins. Yay. You as a as a gullible dupe working class person have gotten on your knees for one of those 2 It makes you defend your ruling the league and criticize the other ruling elite. And even better for them, criticize the constituency of the other ruling elite. So you're a working class person who's on the | 2221.990082 | 2330.5007069999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. The Harris Wall Street. That's exactly what's ticking. And Wait. Politics | 2330.5407069999997 | 2283.5900859999997 |

The guy in the MAGA hat is gonna defend Trump, gonna defend the Republican apparatus. And so far as it abides by, you know, their their cold leader Trump. It's no critique of capitalism as such? No critique of the donor class of fucking factions | 2294.460082 | 2404.410707 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yay. Because the guy was sickling in the fucking lair forever. Now I | 2349.390082 | 2408.090707 |

This time is different, and I seriously, like, they know they've actually our hope could change. Like, my god. We've we've been through this so many fucking times, but because people are there's people that will always be ignorant always be susceptible to being tricked into this way.

| SPEAKER_5 | is | 2549.540082 | 2549.620102 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the endgame | 2605.600727 | 2606.180707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | for | 2606.4807069999997 | 2606.7307069999997 |

| SPEAKER_5 | that. | 2873.690082 | 2874.190082 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. I didn't think you were making fun of her. Like, racing rings at all. Just I know what you're | 2881.590042 | 2942.900707 |
| SPEAKER_0 | saying. | 2942.900707 | 2943.400707 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Wait. What the fuck? Everybody | 2888.1100819999997 | 2945.3107069999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | died? | 2945.370707 | 2945.870707 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Wow. | 2892.160082 | 2892.660082 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Green light and back up and defend the sanctions program and the the the coup attempts year after year and the destabilization of Venezuela. Then turned their anger and hatred on the on the Venezuelan migrants. | 2893.470082 | 2959.570707 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Wait. I remember Oh my god. There's nobody here. | 2906.440082 | 2964.810657 |
| SPEAKER_5 | No | 2965.030707 | 2965.190657 |
| SPEAKER_2 | wonder. Do not come. | 2965.190657 | 2969.910707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So here's the cycle. Sanction, distort all this country wants to nationalize their | 2916.970042 | 2978.390677 |
| SPEAKER_2 | oil. | 2978.390677 | 2978.890677 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This country wants to challenge US imperialism on the global state. Okay. Fuck them up. As Kissinger said, make their economy scream. Right? The old Chilean playbook. Sanction them until that country is And then that creates again, the rhetorical ability for you to blame that on socialism or whatever. But more than that, it creates this huge migration of people who don't have access to medicine when the largest economy in human history is attacking it and putting its arms around it And then those people come up north to the only place where there's opportunities in the region. And the same people who supported those policies that destroyed that country become ultra racist fascists and tell their dumb dumb constituents that those people are the problem. Aliens, are what's causing your hardship. | 2923.120082 | 3036.970747 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Fuck | 2984.3200819999997 | 2984.8200819999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you. They were on a fucking dungeon? That's | 3040.9407069999997 | 3044.000707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Not the ruling elite. Not the economics of of British brutal | 2993.900082 | 3053.644277 |
| SPEAKER_6 | off | 3053.644277 | 3053.986407 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Sorry. | 3054.328537 | 3054.6707069999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Where other countries start, like, neoliberal is air is over. Neoliberalism, of course, was a reaction by the ruling class in the west to the falling rate of | 3002.2100819999996 | 3072.990707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | profit. | 3017.730082 | 3018.150082 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So the unions had to be gunning. Everything had to be deregulated. The keys to society had to be handed over Corporations because those revolving rates of profit were a real structural problem for capitalism as such. | 3020.4600819999996 | 3088.700707 |
| SPEAKER_5 | But | 3035.0401119999997 | 3035.2800819999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | now that has played itself And what do we get after 40 years of neoliberalism? We get this hell world that we live in. Homelessness crisis the housing crisis, the mental health crisis, the health | 3091.260707 | 3102.800707 |
| SPEAKER_5 | care crisis, | 3102.940657 | 3103.370707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | regional wars, endless wars, World War 3, That's what 40 years of neoconservative and neo Woah. Unholy union of neoconservative and neoliberalism And so that's coming to an end brutally, violently, it's going to come to an end. Over there, Satan. I think we're gonna get a few more years of this. | 3048.830082 | 3127.0207069999997 |
| SPEAKER_7 | I'll keep doing it. The elites in the UK have turned to the UK. Into a a | 3071.520032 | 3133.740707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a tax haven and a playground for the ultra rich and let everybody else fuck off And then the reactionary elites in the UK pointed | 3133.740707 | 3142.990707 |
| SPEAKER_7 | And then the dumb dumbs fall for it. So that's what's happening in the UK. Tying that in again | 3088.920122 | 3155.1707069999998 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Mhmm. | 3104.100052 | 3104.260082 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And you see how they all interlocked | 3160.240707 | 3161.940657 |
| SPEAKER_7 | and they all dialectically work together to create this world we're living in? But anyways, | 3106.720082 | 3168.130707 |
| SPEAKER_8 | as most of | 3168.130707 | 3168.610707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the | 3168.610707 | 3168.930707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | western world | 3168.930707 | 3169.330677 |
| SPEAKER_7 | starts to wake up from their neon little haze, No worries. | 3169.330677 | 3172.880707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And their country is being destroyed. Not because of immigrants, | 3120.5700819999997 | 3180.070707 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Which again are a product of all these wars that the US and the imperial corps are constantly fomenting and participating in. But it's a result of the actual elite, those with all the power and money and control and | 3125.780042 | 3194.620707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | society, which have ruined our society. You know, if you take a London believe this is true. You can fat check me. | 3138.8800819999997 | 3200.720707 |
| SPEAKER_7 | I'm pretty sure this is true. Take London out of the equation. Just that one city just to set that aside for now. And you take the UK, you make it an American state, economically, it's on par with the poorest state in the union. | 3145.3800819999997 | 3215.330707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. | 3159.750132 | 3160.250132 |
| SPEAKER_7 | That country has been destroyed. | 3161.0000819999996 | 3218.5207069999997 |
| SPEAKER_8 | Yeah. | 3164.430082 | 3164.510082 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Now some people | 3220.490707 | 3222.010707 |
| SPEAKER_5 | will | 3222.010707 | 3222.1707069999998 |
| SPEAKER_7 | say, well, fuck them. You know, look at this history of colonialism and imperial Do you think the people that conducted colonialism and imperialism are the ones that are suffering? | 3222.1707069999998 | 3230.610707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Mm-mm. | 3175.2301119999997 | 3175.7301119999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Regular working motherfuckers that just happen to be | 3176.560082 | 3235.260667 |
| SPEAKER_2 | born in | 3235.260667 | 3181.6600519999997 |
| SPEAKER_7 | non London, parts of London too, and in the UK. Mean, by no means of my excuse, the British Empire, my fucking god. And, yes, this is this is a product when you have a colonial empire and you plunder and loot the rest of the fucking world. Right? Those that's all true. But an average working class person who just has no opportunities in the UK because of their elite It's not it's not very helpful to say, well, well, that's thanks to colonialism. It's like, I'm I'm a whatever Newcastle or Manchester or fucking, you know, Cardiff or whatever. I didn't have anything to do with the British empire. I just don't have a job, and I don't have any fucking | 3182.040082 | 3278.950707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So the elites have to story that kind | 3226.6500819999997 | 3284.4207069999998 |
| SPEAKER_7 | successfully taught huge swaths of England that powerless | 3230.499982 | 3291.8908069999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | immigrants kindling that's been building for many, many years. Right? Many, many years, the EBL, Tommy Robinson, | 3236.720082 | 3303.010707 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Nigel Farage, all | 3247.629982 | 3304.650707 |
| SPEAKER_5 | this | 3304.810607 | 3304.970607 |
| SPEAKER_2 | shit. | 3304.970607 | 3305.320707 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Which is, like, hilarious I mean, sad and disgusting, but on some level amusing. Way of just shooting yourself in the fucking What? Thinking it's gonna solve the immigration crisis, and all it does is deepen your economic problems. | 3252.1700819999996 | 3323.400707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Poorer country | 3271.900082 | 3328.905707 |
| SPEAKER_7 | detached from the European Union | 3273.350082 | 3331.110707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | creating more economic hardship as you then again and say that's your enemy. Go get them. | 3277.1300819999997 | 3341.790707 |
| SPEAKER_7 | And, of course, creates a backlash of Muslim and anti fascist groups coming together to now push back against the fascists. | 3287.980082 | 3350.9207069999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But, ultimately, you have to do | 3297.890082 | 3355.150707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that. | 3355.150707 | 3355.570707 |
| SPEAKER_7 | The time for political education has passed when fascists are burning swords down doing programs and pulling non white people out of their cars. And beating them brutally. | 3300.230082 | 3366.180707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's what happens when capitalism decays into fascism. But that's precisely what The US imperial hegemoni is coming to an end. | 3317.520182 | 3391.000707 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Whether | 3336.379982 | 3336.780082 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it's World War 3, whether it is the new crop of politicians that come up and slowly pull back, | 3392.760707 | 3398.120707 |
| SPEAKER_7 | whether that is an economic collapse that forces the empire to shrink, | 3342.459982 | 3403.150707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | or just a total all out defeat where more or less the rest of the world team up and says enough is enough. And puts the rapid dog down. And then you have to reset your entire society in or post imperial shortsighted, self serving, fucking pukes. And they're sure as hell not gonna gracefully step back from their imperial hegemony then, then Nothing short of World War 3. Is here to stop them. From continuing | 3347.7901819999997 | 3453.590707 |
| SPEAKER_7 | to try to dominate the rest of the world, spend 1,000,000,000,000 of dollars all over the world. Brutalized | 3398.290082 | 3403.530082 |
| SPEAKER_1 | people. | 3459.625707 | 3460.125707 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You fucking bitch. Shit. I fucking hate you not bought. | 3410.210082 | 3469.160707 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Nothing. I was talk I was yelling at the guy who killed me. | 3414.619982 | 3473.0207069999997 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Failure | 108.68001000000001 | 109.17001000000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to produce enough breast milk as, like, you know, he kind of had guilt and shame about it. But, you know, as we went through specifically. Next step, we're gonna take my Hello, everybody. And welcome back to Hello, everybody. Welcome back to And the first issue I wanna talk about than people, especially those who've never had kids, might have that it is. So formulas and You know, commodity And it's already incredibly expensive very, very expensive, and for working class or, you know, poor parents it can be very hard in Now what happens to the situation? Does it kinda make the case I was saying earlier, of monopoly capital, literally, Johnson. And Nestle. Make up 98% of the market and that it was shared monopoly and, society is a shared monopoly of one sort. Shutdown of the Abbott Labs facility production facilities a bacterial of their machinery that Now why did this happen? Well, because Abbott Labs Meaning, the profit they make as a company was not put into reinvested in the production facility, into the machinery, into maintaining safety standards, let alone into the pockets of workers Higher wages, The 5 let me see here the exact amount. 5.7 $3,000,000,000 was spent On stock buybacks. This is a mechanism by which companies stuff money into the pockets of their shareholders. Instead of spending that over $5,000,000,000 making sure that their facility and their production equipment were up to safety standards, and were running smoothly and not introducing bacteria into formula for infants. So you literally have a situation in which a company uses its profits to stuff the pockets of their shareholders, while neglecting | 109.57001 | 521.140635 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And they did have one stock buyback Let's | 507.781199 | 521.6512 |

| SPEAKER_1 | one with the Bottomless, complete fucking failure. | 62.11062 | 67.09062 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Why? What happened? | 67.09062 | 69.860614 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I, whenever I was putting it on, but it had like, the the deal had fucking one tab, like, one tab that it it's supposed to have 2 tabs that, like, fucking locked in. This is | 14.479995000000002 | 83.81062 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. | 28.39999499999999 | 28.89999499999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. And then in bracket it was probably last. I think both the second one off. So, like, one of our started the wrap, I started to go in the middle. Uh-huh. Because it's, like, it only have one tab. So, like, could only go one direction with it? | 30.339995000000002 | 100.330615 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. | 100.330615 | 100.830615 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Okay. And then | 45.419995 | 102.04062 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the second tab broke off. Was like, well, fuck. I can do a wider rep. So I unwrapped it, until I had, like, just like a loop around it. Because, like, it was difficult as fuck to get that started, but I didn't wanna restart it. And then I went to slide it over, but it fucking broke a steel stick. It, like, separated the steel stick or whatever. So, like, it became 2 pieces again. | 102.04062 | 125.82061999999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Oh. | 71.359995 | 71.67998499999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Wait. Why? Did it, like, dissolve the | 127.66060999999999 | 129.10061 |
| SPEAKER_2 | steel stick or what? No. It just | 129.10061 | 130.70062 |

| SPEAKER_0 | got you. | 140.38062 | 141.06062 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So it's just whenever I, like, try to slide it down because it's wrapped tight or whatever, started to harden, I guess. Mhmm. Slacked it smooth down. So, like, my grip got past the fucking steel stick, then it just fucking pulled them apart. Whatever. But yeah. So that sucks a little bit. That's just fucking way more difficult to fucking work with than they they look like in the video. Almost the | 85.239995 | 167.99062 |

| SPEAKER_1 | In the summer of 2022, returned to Howard University to teach writing. Given my rather niggling career as a university student, I couldn't help but feel somewhat sheepish about the honor. But it was an honor because it was there that I met you Our first class was in the woods. | 0 | 74.420625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I would enroll in Virginia. | 74.420625 | 75.81062499999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Where with my friend, the poet Eve Ewing. Spent 2 weeks reading, writing, and workshopping. I've been teaching writing in some form or capacity | 20.150020000000012 | 84.050625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | for | 84.19064499999999 | 84.35064500000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | almost as long as I've been a writer. And the only work I love more is writing itself. When we share, I found this one. I don't mean to like any other cohort of students I've taught in other times and places. All the time. We were drawn together. By something more profound. I guess it begins with our institution. The fact that it was founded to combat the long shadow of slavery. A shadow that we understood had not yet retreated. This meant that we could never practice writing solely for the craft itself. But mustn't necessarily believe our practice to be in service of that larger emancipatory mandate. This was often alluded to if not directly stated. All of our work dealt with the kind of small particulars of being human that literature generally deals with. But when you live as we have, among the people, humanity has ever endowed even the small in particular. Especially the small in particular, For you, there can be no real distance between writing and politics. And when I saw that in you, I saw it myself. A love of language, of course, is the root of this cell. When I was barely 6 months old, would crawl over to my father's speakers when he played the last poet. And when the record ended, I would cry until he played it again. At 5, I would lie on my bed the poems and rhymes volume of the child craft series | 84.35064500000001 | 169.10064500000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | displayed into the duel. And all | 169.10064500000001 | 171.13062499999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | all day, I could not help but to murmur to myself. The king of dog and the calico cat. Side by side where the table | 115.14999999999995 | 178.360625 |
| SPEAKER_0 | sat. | 178.360625 | 178.78062500000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I did this for no other reason than the way the words felt in my mouth and fell on my ears. Later, I discovered that there were emcees human beings seemingly born and real for the sole purpose of matching the music language to an NPC scenario or 808 kick, and the ensuing alchemy felt as natural to me as a heartbeat. If you want the style I possess. I bless the child of earth, the gods and bomb | 123.6 | 204.300625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the rest. | 204.300625 | 204.810625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Hot. You've heard me say this word word a lot. It is never enough for the reader of your words to be convinced. | 149.98 | 212.77062500000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's hard | 157.19000000000003 | 214.77062500000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to have them think about your words before bed. See them manifest in their dreams. Tell their partner about the next morning. Have them grab random people on the street and shake them the day. Have you read this | 214.77062500000002 | 226.810625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | yet? | 226.810625 | 227.310625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That was what I felt whenever I heard Raquel spit off of that man of the last | 171.69000000000003 | 231.190645 |
| SPEAKER_3 | poem. | 231.190645 | 231.660625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That was the thing that had me murmuring lines from Kyle | 176.32000000000002 | 235.07062499999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | class. | 180.21 | 180.29000000000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This affliction was enchanting at | 236.27062500000002 | 237.870625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the | 237.870625 | 238.120625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | desire. It was pleasure, but also a deep need to my mechanic that pleasure. The math and color behind words and all the emotions they evoked. I imagine they are children who see a painting and cannot get the image out of their mind. I imagine they turn it over a a ecstasy grows in them each time they do this. Because I lived in a house over And what more encouragement could there be that this issue of sports illustrated is featured my hero, Tony Dorsett, running back for the Dallas | 182.13999999999996 | 308.260625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Cowboys. | 308.260625 | 308.660625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This was 1983. An era of American football when running back seemed as large as champions pulled out of Greek myth. How could a man of Earl Campbell's might move so fast racing past 1 defender and then staving in the chest of another. How could Eric Dickerson run so high against all convention bounding through holes in the defense, an obvious target that was never caught? These days, I will occasionally watch an old | 253.39995999999994 | 336.120625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | clip of Roger Craig. | 336.120625 | 337.160625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | To Will alone breaking off a 46 yard run against the Rams. Or Marcus Allen reversing field in the Super Bowl. But back then, in an unwired | 281.17999999999995 | 347.21062500000005 |
| SPEAKER_3 | world, stories | 347.35062500000004 | 348.33062500000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | words, histories, none of it could be gotten on demand. If you were witness to such a feat, as I did with Alan, it lived in memory until the broadcast gods decided you could see it again. And so a magazine featuring the exploits of one of these heroes was not just to me an assembly of words | 293.59000000000003 | 367.010625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | and stories, | 367.010625 | 367.760625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It was a treasure because I really did believe that Tony Dorsett was magic. He was 5 foot 8, below ordinary as one of my uncles. But when he slid the lone star helmet over | 312.39995999999996 | 380.8006250000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | his head, | 380.8006250000001 | 381.46066500000006 |
| SPEAKER_1 | he transformed into something untouchable. Remember him guiding through the defense shifting direction of full speed. This is not what I remember about that issue. In | 325.66999999999996 | 398.500575 |
| SPEAKER_0 | fact, | 398.500575 | 399.000575 |
| SPEAKER_1 | until a few months ago, I'd forgotten that Dorset was even on the cover at all. Because deeper in the magazine, I found the story so unsettling so horrific even, that it blotted out every adjacent | 343.6 | 411.620625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | detail. | 412.000625 | 412.21062500000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The story was titled where am I? It has to be a bad dream. Its subject was Darryl Stingley, who'd once been a wide | 357.26995 | 421.290625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | receiver. | 421.290625 | 421.790625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I thought of wide receivers as mythical too. Contortionist like Wes Chandler extending back to snag a ball bouncing off into the ether. Or aquabats like Lynn Swan dancing in the air. I absorbed that these exploits on Sunday mornings through the highlights curated by the NFL itself. But a magazine like Sports Illustrated existed beyond the garden. Out in the street where journalism literature collided, And out there, neither magic nor myth. Only the realest of monsters. And so I read the true story of Stingley who back in 1978, he went on a slant route woke up in a hospital. The story began there in the hospital. With Stingley unable to move a single limb. Unable to call to his | 422.010585 | 467.130625 |
| SPEAKER_4 | mother, | 467.130625 | 467.57062500000006 |
| SPEAKER_1 | or wipe the tears running down his face, In an instant, the contortionist had been rendered quadriplegic. Only a few paragraphs and I wanted to put the magazine down forever. To escape the story. But I was held fast by forces I could not then understand. I knew that there was something different in the storytelling, something in its style that pulled me toward it with the gravity of a star. Until I was there I was on the field. Yelling, pleading with Stingley to watch out for the incoming hit. And then in the hospital, right next to him, helpless to relieve the horror blooming in his eyes as he realized his fate. And then the star became a black hole | 411.83000000000004 | 508.380625 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. This one says when removing a chip from a circuit board, the maximum heat you should apply is typically around 662 Fahrenheit or 350 degrees Celsius. | 162.51999999999998 | 221.07999999999998 |

| SPEAKER_1 | typically use. | 293.82 | 294.22 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I don't know how accurate this is. Know what that means. I find if you're gonna do ground planes, you definitely need more heat. But for thin traces on a dip board like this single layer board, or double layer, you're gonna need as low temperature as you can go. Well, at least as this goes, so 3 50. Higher temperatures risk damaging the board. | 294.22 | 314 |

| SPEAKER_1 | What do you mean | 672.9818348884583 | 708.0999998884583 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I scraped the silicone stuff off of it so I could read the numbers. | 674.0318748950958 | 711.3999998950958 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Found out there were numbers. Or actual shit written on them? That's the word. Oh, that was on the original, but that's I don't | 678.7418448925018 | 722.8299998925017 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I'm pretty sure I, like, removed all of this the clear coating that was on it so that I could read the numbers. And I can't tell which one it | 718.6518750190735 | 760.7999700190735 |
| SPEAKER_1 | know. No. That is the original one | 722.829999923706 | 724.2299999237061 |
| SPEAKER_2 | here. No. I | 724.2300000190735 | 724.7100000190735 |
| SPEAKER_4 | know what I'm saying. I thought that one was for a second. I just said no. It's not. Like this one is a little bit scratched. Like, a little bit, scratched off, but I | 724.710000038147 | 704.7018750381469 |
| SPEAKER_2 | can actually wait. Did you guys I don't know. I can't tell. | 739.0099999904633 | 741.6699599904632 |

| SPEAKER_1 | the temperature to be down or just the pressure to be down? | 780.1500000953674 | 783.6800000953674 |
| SPEAKER_4 | don't know about that, but I would I would think start with try lower a | 785.6600000858307 | 756.5318750858307 |
| SPEAKER_4 | It's this one. | 789.9018750190735 | 827.1100000190735 |

| SPEAKER_4 | didn't think about it. | 845.0618751049042 | 880.3300001049041 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Do you know how circuit boards can get? | 851.4418749809265 | 887.8399999809266 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I mean, I he said to do be careful with it. So I would don't think you should hold it there for very long. | 854.3318750858307 | 894.6100000858307 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Yeah. I made | 855.9700000286102 | 856.3700000286102 |

| SPEAKER_4 | Sorry. That's fine. I didn't | 877.4700000286102 | 878.5900000286102 |
| SPEAKER_4 | So let's find out. How hot can circuit boards get When trying to remove a chip with a heat gun | 878.0618751049042 | 929.3700001049042 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I've | 878.670000076294 | 879.170000076294 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Circuit | 896.1818749904633 | 896.5818749904632 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Typically, they can reach temperatures around 200 250 degrees Celsius depending on the type of solder and the components involved. It's crucial to ensure the board doesn't overheat as excessive heat can damage the board and other components. Are you working on a specific | 900.4818749427795 | 950.8399999427796 |
| SPEAKER_4 | But that didn't say Hell, cock, give | 921.6419250965118 | 958.4900300965118 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Causing damage. | 926.1018750667572 | 961.1000000667573 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Hey. Look at this. | 929.2718749046326 | 964.5600399046326 |
| SPEAKER_2 | boards can get pretty hot when using a heat gun to remove a chip. | 930.8900001049042 | 934.2300001049042 |
| SPEAKER_9 | Yeah. I saw that actually. I mean, I was watching you do it, but I didn't think about it. And so like I didn't really like about what you're doing. It's funny. | 931.0518450737 | 974.2899600737 |
| SPEAKER_4 | What's the max temperature of heat? To apply to a circuit board? | 948.5818750858307 | 987.4200000858307 |
| SPEAKER_2 | project? | 951.2200000286102 | 951.7200000286102 |
| SPEAKER_7 | The maximum temperature you should apply My guidelines won't let me talk about that. | 957.7618749141693 | 998.1399999141694 |
| SPEAKER_8 | the secret boy | 958.4900300502777 | 959.0500000502777 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. | 959.210000038147 | 959.710000038147 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What? | 964.1668350696564 | 964.5018750696563 |
| SPEAKER_9 | What your guidelines don't allow you to talk about what? | 964.5818750858307 | 1001.1900000858307 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Where's the Saldurak? Or what is the chip what is the chip called that you're removing? The ECM? | 973.4918448925018 | 1024.3899998925017 |
| SPEAKER_5 | chip. | 991.001874923706 | 991.501874923706 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's that's the exact ship board is called the PCM. Or the ECM the ECU | 992.4119749069214 | 1036.0949999069214 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I'm removing the EE prom Wait. What the hell? EE prom? | 1003.3717749118805 | 1043.5999999118803 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Eeprom | 1011.0318748950958 | 1011.5318748950958 |
| SPEAKER_2 | e | 1012.8218750953674 | 1013.0618750953674 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Prom. Okay. Yeah. From the ECM. | 1014.281975030899 | 1050.4500000308992 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. I'm | 1016.7417750358582 | 1025.7318750358581 |
| SPEAKER_1 | EEPROM | 1024.5299999713898 | 1025.0299999713898 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Okay. | 1025.8150000572205 | 1026.3150000572205 |
| SPEAKER_4 | trying to remove the EE prom chip from a ECM for a car. | 1026.001874923706 | 1066.359999923706 |
| SPEAKER_7 | When we're moving an EPROM chip from an ECM, it's best to keep the temperature around 200 to 250 degrees Celsius. Yes. This should be hot enough to melt the solder without damaging the board or components. Make sure to apply the heat evenly and carefully. Are you familiar with using a heat gun or soldering station? | 1033.6118750572205 | 1086.2900000572204 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Sorry. | 1043.5999999046326 | 1044.0999999046326 |
| SPEAKER_0 | e. | 1047.369999885559 | 1047.869999885559 |
| SPEAKER_4 | What is that in Celsius? | 1058.9318749904633 | 1094.3799999904631 |
| SPEAKER_5 | You said 250? | 1063.1918749809265 | 1098.4800999809265 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. | 1064.5818750858307 | 1065.0818750858307 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Okay. | 1176.4400000572205 | 1176.9400000572205 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Sort of dying We're gonna be dying on you, man. Can I can't even keep airplanes alive? They're, like, lowest maintenance ever. What's Is that even try it on a chip thingy. Is it is it even the liquidy? Try and I mean, in the video, he held it there for, like, not that long. I mean, I would think it wouldn't take that long. I thought he used a sorry. Nope. He did it. I mean, I'll double check though. Let me see. I'm almost positive now. I'm, like, 98% positive if you did it. | 1265.9798159599304 | 1330.0816909599305 |

Like, people who are line dancing. Are fucking yeah. Line dances are fucking weird to me. Me. That right there, you know what that that that is like the, that is to me a stark like, a stark Example, I guess, of the commodification of everything. Because I literally like, when dance dancing is like the is like solely like the like, The Reaction between, like, what is it? The, it's artistic, and it's, like, just, whatever between 2 people and, like, their their, like, human connection, you know, like that kind | 1446.248484 | 1497.268484 |
| SPEAKER_0 | of thing. And it's | 1497.268484 | 1499.0984939999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like, | 1499.238494 | 1499.538484 |
| SPEAKER_1 | there's no, like, set rules or, like, how you have to dance or anything like that. You're just kinda, like, going to, like I don't know. So that to | 1465.950359 | 1507.738484 |
| SPEAKER_0 | me, I like. | 1507.738484 | 1508.558484 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But then you have, like, these line dances, and they're doing it more and more now, like almost every song has a fucking like, every other song, | 1474.410359 | 1513.738494 |
| SPEAKER_0 | first of all, that they play is a line | 1514.038484 | 1515.4084839999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | dance, but just in general, the fact that there's line dances to, like, all of these songs that they're not, like, what the fuck? Just see like, these people are just like | 1481.2603689999999 | 1523.298474 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm like, what are they fucking like, they they looks like fucking | 1523.458484 | 1526.1484839999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | robots. They're just like assimilating. It looks so weird out on like the dance floor. Everybody doing the exact same thing at the exact same time, following a certain, like, amount, like, for a sort a certain, like, procedure or whatever, just following the know, doing what they've | 1491.8403589999998 | 1539.548484 |
| SPEAKER_2 | been told. | 1539.548484 | 1540.288464 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. I mean, now I think it's weird for sure, but, like, I I think that even that was okay at first, honestly. I think that that was part of one | 1508.420359 | 1552.6184839999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | of that was one of the songs that made it that they used, or I feel like that I don't know. I just feel like almost any | 1552.6184839999999 | 1561.7084839999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | almost there's like a tons of things that ended up like there were strictly, like, | 1527.720359 | 1567.998484 |
| SPEAKER_3 | just | 1568.058484 | 1568.228484 |
| SPEAKER_2 | created by people for people thing. Not for profit in any way whatsoever. A | 1534.5603889999998 | 1540.0703589999998 |

| SPEAKER_0 | work. So it kind of makes it pacifies. This is and this is my | 226.098115 | 231.908115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | way of looking at it. I don't know that I've heard this anywhere | 198.07999 | 234.94811500000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | before, | 234.94811500000003 | 235.408115 |

| SPEAKER_2 | don't know why it's so quiet. I mean are not perceived to be as credible as their male counterparts. So what comes to that building gap? | 294.428115 | 302.348115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Why is it there? How is it different aside from the fact that many | 268.97999 | 306.598115 |

| SPEAKER_3 | No one | 368.713115 | 369.975615 |

| SPEAKER_1 | time. | 2611.217443 | 2611.717443 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But he | 2612.337443 | 2579.849318 |
| SPEAKER_1 | hasn't been like I've been | 2614.157443 | 2616.287443 |
| SPEAKER_0 | playing with him | 2583.019308 | 2618.387443 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, | 2585.0693180000003 | 2585.309318 |
| SPEAKER_0 | he's been gone for, like, years. | 2619.617443 | 2621.717443 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. | 2590.149328 | 2590.649328 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Keep going. And they'll come back every once in a while. And then we'll do, like yeah. I don't know. He just checked me. | 2627.0974530000003 | 2641.127453 |
| SPEAKER_1 | He's with the little kid when I | 2641.747443 | 2649.027443 |
| SPEAKER_0 | 70 now. Probably, maybe. I don't know. | 2623.619318 | 2661.467443 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And then it's locked me as a sitting there like, what a bunch of rape spot. Yeah. | 2627.5493180000003 | 2658.399318 |
| SPEAKER_0 | He didn't. Well, I guess he did ask me. I'm just gonna eventually, but Right. I still think that Right. There's | 2658.639318 | 2710.787443 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Being nice. Too Well, first off, no. I didn't I didn't even spend a year like 6 months later, I'm given this talk at the University of Wisconsin. The Life Positive People. And I'd say about half the room were white folks, but half of them were folks of color most black. I'd tell that story. It was really interesting. To watch the reaction, like, white folks starting getting nervous for me. Why were gonna rush to pay what black people were gonna be surprised that the white guy had had a racist thought. That had had a race to sun, and they were definitely surprised that I shared that in an open space. | 2710.822443 | 2780.237443 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. And it is the one We don't in people that don't remind us of ourselves. And that kind of affect senior review. It can affect the performance of I in an educational setting. In addition to that, | 2728.790385 | 2771.4703849999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't think any of us have been totally under control. Some better than others. You know? But but even if we're doing pretty good on our own work. Right? It's we're not interrogating the standards that we're using. We might be perpetuating and quality. So think about 10 year old. And I and I've dealt with this in a lot of ways. Back to that script with you both with the instance. I was talking about. This is not every faculty member is experiencing the same school. And the same work and the same experience So in other words, we might all be held with the same standard Right? But some of us are having to do some extra stuff rewarded or considered in the process of tenure about So for instance, if I'm a black faculty member and I to find out every fire every | 2728.4822599999998 | 2839.2522599999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | diversity like me, so they need me on that committee and list life. That did that. There'll be half of a more diverse pool of people to choose from at the end of the process. That is important, but that's extra work. And it's oftentimes even usually not in considered at the point of the tenure review, we have very specific and narrow criteria and not extra racial mode of labor and oftentimes gender evokes no labor that women of color return working class folks on a class level of any grade where at this background has to deal with. So I'm not saying James standards But I'm saying in terms of, how much time a person gets to get in. I'm certainly not saying treat people differently, but I'm saying recognize that there's a lot of work that isn't and its production, it surely is not just About that handover thing that we offer to the patient. And that's not just 5 black and brown on that page. Based on race or ethnicity, It's about recognizing that we Right. And so we say that we equity and inclusion and diversity, you know, these Not just when it comes to hiring back | 2879.8072599999996 | 3118.030385 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And | 3084.88226 | 3085.38226 |
| SPEAKER_1 | making sure that whoever is in the fact that you not just black and brown faculty. The white faculty as well are faculty Good. The It's not some magical thing that black and brown folks just automatic. We know how to do have had such an And in this country, we measure what we value. And if we don't measure, we are Right? We ran everything. We measured everything. Us. That's what those USU's rankings are all looked out. Right? For colleges, so that's what that's what the the we are | 3086.13226 | 3210.670385 |
| SPEAKER_0 | adopt their, like, reading lunch. | 3181.65226 | 3218.380385 |
| SPEAKER_1 | On shit. What app or, like, text. We measure what we value. We say we value you principles the mix of how people evaluated and then rewarded And so even when we're trying to we're Let's see. Come on. Not accommodate for this to be. Not the workforce that it is, to transform the society with the betterment of all and that is actually important evidence but those do have special obligation to take that very seriously. This second thing is to cast the net widely physicians, administration, and staff recognize that you often fall back on the patterns and the practices that we know and the people that we know and the place where we think we can find the number, measure, I'm doing that to people with COVID. Any kind of member takes the necessary step to a narrowing of someone that should be proud promoted respect given one last thing that I had to mention yet, but I will before She has to make Real personal connection with your colleagues. And personal connection with students in your area. Otherwise, they I used to think that that was to sort of I don't know. And I didn't see the rat. I couldn't miss the bad and I was real caught up in my own sense of rata. And then what I've learned is that that's the doesn't really change very widely. Quickly. And I realized this | 3186.26226 | 3456.3903849999997 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I don't know why during | 3423.69226 | 3459.700415 |

| SPEAKER_4 | Yes. | 175.65990999999997 | 176.15990999999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So, like, how how far do you think systemic waste of the next 5 to, | 180.48996 | 184.85996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like | 220.02808500000003 | 220.52808500000003 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Quite. | 220.988115 | 221.30812500000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | A a person of Very far as often, and sometimes it can even be, like, threatening. They believe that racism can only happen to marginalized groups, like, can what can black people be racist? | 221.62813500000004 | 241.568085 |
| SPEAKER_4 | White Americans cannot experience racism in the United States. That's my answer to that question. | 208.77996000000007 | 247.828085 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Can black people be | 215.13995999999997 | 250.73808500000007 |
| SPEAKER_5 | raped? | 250.73808500000007 | 251.23808500000007 |
| SPEAKER_4 | In the United States, no. Has racism worked negatively negatively affect us. So how can we engage in a system that's exists to negatively harm us? | 217.57996000000003 | 263.00808500000005 |
| SPEAKER_3 | What about racial slurs, derogatory towards white people as Latin or racist, Would, like, say the word There's cracker, not a racist phone booth. Or if somebody says that is not racist, | 229.65996000000007 | 276.84808499999997 |
| SPEAKER_5 | No. | 243.91996000000006 | 244.07995999999991 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I wouldn't call them racist. | 278.38808499999993 | 279.66808500000013 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But is it not being racist if I said, say, I said the n word? Would that be racist? | 247.04005999999993 | 286.788085 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yes. Because and you say if you're white, can you say that word? You're perpetuating a system of harm against | 252.75995999999998 | 293.338085 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Okay. So what about crackers? Is that not derogatory? It's not for creating a system of harm against women. So people say friendly is what is your you trying to say that it's a friendly word? | 264.46996 | 311.83818499999995 |
| SPEAKER_4 | No. My argument is what I said. It's not perpetuating a system of harm. | 277.72996 | 316.94798500000013 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Well, would it be prepared as rain? It's a derogatory term. | 284.98996 | 323.808085 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I | 289.76995999999997 | 290.00996 |
| SPEAKER_4 | didn't suppose to be I think you think it could be racially discriminatory. Sure. That's as far as it go with Which is racist. Right? | 324.318085 | 330.788085 |
| SPEAKER_5 | No. | 296.6399600000001 | 296.95996 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I think being racially discriminated group took being racial racially discriminatory and being racist or engaging in racism are 2 different things. | 331.26808500000004 | 340.35808499999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Okay. So if you just here's something I don't agree with their systemic racism. No. So Asian people are way more marginalized than | 307.24986 | 350.328085 |
| SPEAKER_5 | You don't move. Black people. | 316.18006 | 351.828085 |

But what's behind me is really what paints a picture of what happened here earlier tonight I'm counting at least 70 evidence markers you're seeing shell casings even a loaded magazine and a shoe on the ground We do know at least 2 guns were used in the shooting and it happened just feet away from the TA Travel Center with several people inside. Police say the victim appears to be in his late teens to early twenties He was found dead in his vehicle, which is Lost this Poking lot. With a gun next to it. They say it's unclear if he was firing back. Police believe the suspect took off in the vehicle. They have located one of those vehicles but have not caught up with any of the suspected shooters. I spoke to one couple who were inside the TA Travel Center when they saw a security guard run outside. Minutes later, they | 389.01986 | 484.9480850000001 |

| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. So if you're just talking about, like, the definition of the word they would not have that, Asian Americans don't have, like, any influence over the economy. They don't really have an over policies. That would be predominantly held by, like, white Americans. | 514.8599600000001 | 566.3780849999999 |

| SPEAKER_1 | not a topic that somebody would instantly jump to. The white person that could question if he's from Europe | 644.012245 | 648.132245 |
| SPEAKER_2 | experience, like, mass amounts of racial tension once he got into the office? Do you think that didn't happen? | 613.61412 | 654.022245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Think that doesn't happen to white people? To | 620.85412 | 657.402245 |
| SPEAKER_0 | boy. | 657.402245 | 657.902245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah | 627.74412 | 628.02412 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Not just people making you out of your voice. This | 645.06412 | 682.162245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | logic behind it. No one how am I | 671.08412 | 709.402245 |
| SPEAKER_3 | defending Jessica this | 709.402245 | 710.27224 |
| SPEAKER_1 | whole time? Continue. Go ahead. No. I'm not. I'm just saying that racism has been more Oh, I'm just saying more than my gosh, What I'm trying to say is black people can be racist, and you're acting like I'm defending racism because black people can | 710.27224 | 691.53412 |
| SPEAKER_2 | be racist. | 725.902245 | 726.488915 |
| SPEAKER_1 | What is | 726.488915 | 726.702245 |
| SPEAKER_2 | racism? | 726.702245 | 727.14225 |
| SPEAKER_1 | By | 727.14225 | 727.5822450000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | definition. | 727.5822450000001 | 728.0822450000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I'm sorry, Vivian. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, | 728.302245 | 729.502251 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Vivian. | 729.502251 | 729.752251 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I'm | 729.752251 | 730.042245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | marginalized group. Or | 700.41412 | 705.10412 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So then I disagree that any white person | 705.78412 | 742.492245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | can | 742.492245 | 742.692245 |
| SPEAKER_2 | ever experience that because they're not marginalized. | 708.54412 | 744.552245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So if I put 1 person if if I put 1 white person in a black neighborhood, he's not marginalized? | 712.95412 | 752.212255 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. White people are not marginalized. And that would not mean | 718.47412 | 755.7355749999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | By definition that would make him Marginalized. Would not mean realize. | 755.842245 | 758.982245 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That white people marginalize | 725.15412 | 760.842245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | them. That would make that 1 white person marginalized, which is susceptible to raising up because, you know, one person. That's basically what you're trying to | 761.382245 | 770.792245 |
| SPEAKER_2 | say. | 770.792245 | 771.292245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | What about a white person yeah. What about a white person in Japan? I saw those part of your article. Probably it. That's why I specifically said when I | 741.45412 | 782.912245 |
| SPEAKER_2 | started this conversation, America. That white people in America can face systemic oppression based on the color | 749.1641099999999 | 789.842245 |
| SPEAKER_4 | of their skin. Oh, | 789.842245 | 791.062235 |
| SPEAKER_2 | My definition of racism is systemic oppression. | 781.7141300000001 | 819.162255 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So systemic So why would you use systemic oppression in systemic racism? Because | 788.34412 | 835.192245 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm giving you the definition of systemic racism. I'm just giving you the definition of racism. | 835.2522349999999 | 839.842245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Systemic is an adjective. | 806.61412 | 842.9422549999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Are you deaf? | 809.04412 | 844.882245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Can you hear? No. I'm just saying. Can you hear the words that | 811.29412 | 848.342245 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What word did I give you the definition of? | 814.27413 | 850.532245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Define systemic racism into | 817.09412 | 852.952245 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Systemic racism would be, I've defined it a little different. Differently. I say systemic racism, I would define as specific, policy and more Laws that have been that have, yes, | 819.17412 | 870.002245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | specific policies | 870.002245 | 870.9722449999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | and or laws that have shaped how systems run to negatively affect people of | 836.9041199999999 | 876.0822450000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | color. So right now oh, people of color only. So Japanese. Asian Americans are are not included. Asian Americans are People of color is real people of color is literally related to factor. | 876.0822450000001 | 891.912225 |

| SPEAKER_2 | need to be the lack of color. | 902.872245 | 904.192245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. If we wanna be technical, that isn't the color either. | 870.28412 | 906.9922449999999 |

| SPEAKER_0 | We've made | 928.2541200000001 | 963.252245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | made that repair. | 929.02412 | 964.232265 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So as I was saying, you can't point to a single issue where people have been systemically oppressed based on a color of their skin. | 933.1541199999999 | 972.352245 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But I mean, in several hoods, white people are repressed by black people. | 940.44412 | 978.192245 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's not that's not | 944.34412 | 979.952265 |
| SPEAKER_1 | oppression. It's systemic in their | 980.8122450000001 | 982.332265 |
| SPEAKER_4 | tone. | 982.332265 | 982.772245 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's not oppression. And I | 948.86412 | 984.1322250000001 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Oh, so by definition, a white man in a black neighborhood being oppressed, being beaten by the color of his skin is oppression. What | 969.87412 | 1014.1722649999999 |
| SPEAKER_5 | did you say that's | 1014.1722649999999 | 1015.052265 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Hi. I'm Ashley. | 0 | 0.9800002000000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This up, letting them receive a piece of the pie. Yeah. Because because even though they've helped build the business up, they didn't they didn't put in any of the risk to get it started. The business wouldn't exist without somebody else first putting forth all of the financial risk to start it. And then they provide that person provided them with the opportunity to help build it up. But they are providing all the labor. Right? Like like, Amazon would | 40.328125 | 103.29625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | be would effectively be done if no one decided to work for them. Right? It does matter how innovative Jeff Bezos is, if nobody will do the work because he's refusing to give them proper working conditions, they're not going he's not gonna make any money. He's only making money off the backs of | 69.308125 | 123.78625000000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | others. Yeah. But mutual relationship. He owns the mean he own he he applies all the he takes up all takes on all the risk, He puts forth the means to to The only way to fight stigma and shame. | 123.92625000000001 | 146.18625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Is to shine light on it. Ask your health care provider if Big Tarby is right for you, and visit bigtarvy.com to view the important facts, including important warnings. | 112.58812499999999 | 157.20624999999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | To get to for all these workers to work And then those workers then come in knowing that he, took in all the risk, and he did he built the place for them to work, and all the systems that they will begin to operate within. And then they go and then can operate within those. And then as the company grows, obviously, their their roles may expand. Their role roles may change. But their but they they still never but the business would have never existed if they didn't. It the business wouldn't have existed even if they | 122.898125 | 189.27624999999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | didn't. | 189.27624999999998 | 189.70624999999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Because somebody else would have come and done the work. | 155.95812499999997 | 192.24625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But hold on. So I think the I think the the heat that they took the risk thing is is not entirely accurate. Right? So like, let's say I am running a cookie a cookie stand. I'm selling cookies on the side of the road. And I'm by myself. I can only sell 10 cookies an hour. Right? Mhmm. Now I realize that if I hire somebody, to help me, we could sell 20 cookies an hour. | 158.978125 | 219.36624999999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | If if I'm selling 10 cookies an hour and each cookie is $5, I make $50 an hour. I keep that profit. If I can sell 20 cookies an hour, that's a $100 an hour. Instead of and I if I had to split that with the other person who's doing the exact same work, I don't make any more profit. So instead, I say, well, you could have $25 an hour, and then I get 75 even though we're both doing the to do the same thing? No. They're selling we we they're selling my cookies. They're doing all the same work that I'm doing. Like, I I would | 253.989861 | 288.639861 |
| SPEAKER_1 | if I was the the the first cookie stand, I sold 10 cookies an hour for 10 cookies a day for a dollar each, I made $10. I was like, you know what? I wanna make more money. So I go and, have my friend also sell 10 cookies for $2. And then they keep the $10 and then I keep the excess $10 that they made. And now I've made more money he was still adequately paid based off of what I was already earning. And then I'm and now I'm taking an additional profit because I'm making them charge more, which is what how most businesses operate. But I would then argue that | 254.221733 | 323.219861 |
| SPEAKER_2 | now we get into the issue of capitalism the second issue of capitalism where there are effectively scamming the consumer. You're over inflating the price of your cookies, now so you can generate profit. You are now saying, I'm not gonna screw over my employee. They can have the exact same money as me. I'm just gonna screw over the consumer. Which I think is equally wrong. | 289.15173599999997 | 345.799851 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And that's | 314.311736 | 349.359861 |

| SPEAKER_1 | My my ex girlfriend was actually a theater girl. One of my ex girlfriends was that | 71.86000000000001 | 109.52812500000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | was that Hey. No. | 109.52812500000002 | 110.168125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I was | 110.168125 | 110.65812500000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | so cool. I never saw that one before. | 76.75 | 115.618131 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Was it, like, a DJ table? It I I really I was looking at it. Good up. That's it. Alright. | 81.83000000000001 | 88.75 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So I will give you the opening floor. We get a Parker raid? Hey. What's up, Parker raid? Welcome to the debate today. It's me and David. I will I will damn. | 123.05812500000002 | 134.608125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | How'd that | 135.148125 | 135.558125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | little blizzie back. I will give I'll give you the opening floor, David, to you know my topics, and I'm I'm sure you've got some you wanna touch on. So whatever you wanna talk about first. | 101.57000000000002 | 147.228125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. So which one should we start on first? You responded to video | 115.18 | 154.698135 |
| SPEAKER_2 | just wanted | 121.18 | 155.968135 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to | 155.968135 | 156.128125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | say again. I don't wanna say again. We are very proud of David He has come a long way. Since he was in my comments. Months ago, So I still wanna I wanna commend David for unlearning his transphobia. We love him for that. | 156.128125 | 171.468125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. It was, and then and then a lot of ways, it was of no fault of my own. Just purely me not being in the culture. I didn't understand a lot of what goes through the minds and even hearts of people in the LGBT community in general. Right? I just didn't know didn't never never knew a lot of them, so I never really got to understand understand them, like, why they felt the way that they feel or anything like that. And so out of that ignorance, I was very susceptible and when people when, like, propaganda was a, like, hey. They're trying to put strip strip club drag shows at all these elementary schools. It's like I see, like, a extreme headlines where they're blowing shit way out of freaking portion. Even just lately, getting misinformation, And I'll be I'll be like, oh my gosh. I don't know anything about them. So that sounds like it could be reasonable. | 137.15999999999997 | 226.588125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Not more. I'm | 192.83999999999997 | 227.788145 |
| SPEAKER_1 | seeing it. Real. | 227.788145 | 228.498125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Alright. Well, go ahead. Floor's all yours. Sorry I interrupted. I just wanted to commend you on that. But floor's all yours. | 194.75 | 234.998125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Appreciate it. Yeah. I I the the video that you responded to your in your video earlier, I think, was talking about how a lot of pro choices will I see, like, a lot of pro choices on here arguing whether or not it's a human life or not. And I would I would say that just purely, like, scientifically speaking, that because it can be defined | 200.84999999999997 | 260.378145 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Sorry. Those are method. I'm not acknowledging the Parker raid. I acknowledge you, Parker. Raid. Hello, | 226.95002 | 265.468125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Parker Raid. No no worries. If you need to address your checks, I know you y'all sort of stream on Twitch and stuff too. I I | 265.468125 | 270.388125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | We'll arrive on Twitch | 270.708125 | 271.848145 |
| SPEAKER_1 | now. No. Don't worry, Parker. Love you, Parker. You go, though. Don't worry When it comes to like, something that is, an organism can be classified as a as as living It's It it has to be moving and and growing. I believe our 2 of, like, the the key characteristics. I don't know the exact definition, but moving and growing are characteristic that are fundamental to it. Mhmm. | 271.908125 | 271.33 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And | 306.418125 | 306.898125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and therefore, if it is a, lit lit if the zygote is living and can can be classified as living, then it it then it would be because it's a human, Zygote, it'd be a human life. So it's like, in my opinion, it's like the the debate is not whether or not life when life begins, I I believe that the debate starts at where do rights begin? And that's where the the real debate is but I feel like, a lot of like, inexperienced debaters on TikTok, I guess, framed their argument around the the prior versus just acknowledging that it's a human life and then debating on whether or not it has rights. Especially rights that supersede that of the mothers. And so I think that's where the the debate should be, and I would say that a fundamental right of humans is the right to life to to Lair. And In when it comes to pregnancy, because now, obviously, there's there's a bare clear exception to this, but because it the woman caused the pregnancy, they therefore, would not have the right to freely do what they want with it unless obviously her life was at risk. So, like, if | 273.23001999999997 | 400.108125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | in life at risk, is that the only exception that you make in that instance? | 400.108125 | 403.388125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The the health. I wouldn't even say life. I would say the the the exception because Let me I'll I'll make my position even more more painstakingly clear instead of just trying to go around it like that. I believe that leg there should be zero legislation regarding the female body. Therefore, because there should be no legislation that is regulating the body, It would be inappropriate to regulate when an abortion can be performed in a during pregnancy. It's like if we say 5 months, then you're you're regulating a natural process within the, like, the female body So I I think it's wrong. I I think that it should be we should be more clear on the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus and then then make sure that our dog ethical framework to ensure like, a what's the word? | 370.84 | 467.248125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Personally would trust the doctors and the mother to make that distinction. And and a hell of a lot more than politicians. Okay. | 500.61284700000004 | 508.87284700000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So let me just give you my, view on abortion, and then we can, like, talk about each other's user. I think we're actually very similar in our practical application of our abortion views. I very much believe the only person that should be able to make a choice regarding abortion should be a pregnant person and their doctor. I don't believe anybody else should involved in the pregnancy should be able to make that decision. Mhmm. I don't even think that the other party involved in the pregnancy should be able to make that decision. Mhmm. Decision. I think only the person who is pregnant and their doctor. That's it. Now I agree. I think there shouldn't be any you said, there should be 0 regulation or legislation regarding it. I think at max, we can have one legislation saying there shall be no legislation Like, don't think there should be any legislation, in regards to abortion at all. Very much I base my stance very much off of the model that's currently in Canada. I think we definitely have different views on, like, the moral implications of abortion. I believe that anything prior to 24 weeks is completely and utterly moral, and there's no way for me to believe that it could be unless I very much my stance of abortion is a mix of a couple things, predominantly being moral obligation for consciousness and then bodily autonomy. So I use both of those sort of interchangeably. So I I I I believe that you can absolutely qualify it as a life prior to birth. I'm sorry. At conception, I absolutely believe that we can say it's a life. And I believe that most people would agree it is a human life. I would just disagree on whether it's a human I would really wanna let her ahead. Exactly. I really wanna look at, like, is this a person And if it's not a person, I really don't have a moral quandary with killing a body. Because I believe that we've already set a precedent in human society that bodies kind of come and go. What we really care about is that subjective conscious human exterior. It's really where I go. And when we get into, like, the right thing, I believe that you can give it whatever rights you want at at birth. Like, you can give the right to life. It doesn't mean it has the right to resources necessary to stay and state, specifically where it failed to come from another person, but we'll get into that as we, like, our back and forth. | 509.332847 | 643.872847 |
| SPEAKER_2 | HealthCare.gov has plans for health because you have plans for life. All plans cover doctor visits and emergency care. To keep you and your family running strong. All plans cover hospital stays and prescriptions to give you peace of mind. 4 out of 5 customers can find Aetna plan for $10 or less per month with financial help. Visit healthcare.gov to explore plans from the brands you know. New law, lower prices. Healthcare.gov is here for you you. Final deadline, January 15th. | 610.6047120000001 | 674.122847 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This season's letter's better in | 645.764722 | 682.492847 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Fox 7 News. New season Friday, January 30th at 8. Watch on NBC. | 648.644722 | 686.172847 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. That and that goes into, like, like, obviously, like, breast milk would do that. Going down that, like, giving her her resources post birth | 653.214712 | 695.562847 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. She well, yes. As long as you can consent to it, can get whatever resources you want. It just has to be consensual. Only those resources can be taken by a by an entity. They have to be consensually given. | 661.894722 | 707.302837 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Okay. Yeah. And I and I think that that is a very and we we have the, liberty to do that now because | 674.5447320000001 | 715.972847 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Over the booty. | 749.354722 | 784.562847 |
| SPEAKER_1 | A person who's, like, under 24 weeks pregnant, usually, you only get charged with the involuntary termination of a pregnancy as opposed to, like, a double homicide. | 779.254722 | 822.5428469999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Mhmm. Yeah. So and so you so so there's a value change of rights Uh-uh. In terms of, like, modality, Like, the Not even not even We we assign different value to life at different stages. | 790.4747219999999 | 843.3128670000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. I mean, we yes. We absolutely prescribe the antibiotics. And I'll | 843.3128670000001 | 846.952847 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I'll agree. I'm not and I'm and just so you know, I'm not I I'll never be, like, trying to, like, say, gotcha. I'm genuinely just trying to have a Right. A fluid conversation. So I don't feel like I'm And so when it comes to assigning value to rights, I I think there are certain rights that value is not relevant. To. Right? Like, alright, would you say, like, the right to life like, to be a to to live and to not be, unalived. Would be something that doesn't need value to be true. | 846.952847 | 893.332847 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. Not not really. No. I would I would actually say that the right to life might need more value than any other right. Like, if I'm just thinking, like, off the top of my head, because if if not for val, you Right? I would say you you doesn't really matter what we do. So, like, in in regards to moral consideration | 860.954722 | 914.502867 |
| SPEAKER_3 | in that sense, | 914.6428470000001 | 915.462847 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a person who is brain dead Right? I would say because they've lost their because they've lost the not not that they don't have value, but because they've lost the thing that we value as a species, they really there is no need to keep them alive. You're not hurting anyone by taking them off of life support. Right? You're not causing any harm. You're you're effectively reducing harm. So, like, because they've lost the piece of of humanity that we value, that's what I would say. And I think it's the same with a fetus. They need to to gain that piece that we that piece that we value. And then I'll bring them whatever rights, you know, we wanna grant them as people. | 881.854742 | 955.442847 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. But don't you think that There are right spots | 922.9747219999999 | 964.892817 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Get a free emergency pizza to use when you need it most. | 935.614722 | 973.252847 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Only when you order online at Domino's. | 939.104722 | 975.112817 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Just I I'm just trying to to track with you. And respond appropriately. Yeah. | 945.364722 | 985.262847 |
| SPEAKER_1 | For | 985.262847 | 985.422847 |
| SPEAKER_3 | sure. But for rights, for moral consideration, Mhmm. How how do you differentiate what you give more or less moral consent human human life. Because because because | 985.422847 | 1015.662847 |
| SPEAKER_1 | okay. Go ahead. Because | 981.914722 | 1016.942897 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I would give equal moral consideration to all human life. I mean, the in terms of of of them being a human being, like, even a corpse, I would say that your the vessel of your consciousness as much as your consciousness is deserving of rights, which you're basically, you're saying, like, you're is what your personhood is what I have gives you rights I would say that the vessel of that sentience is equally as important because the sentience | 1016.942897 | 1046.6128469999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So I would I would disagree slightly, especially when we look at at, how we're advancing tech technology wise. Like, let's say, and this is, you know, this is gonna be a hypothetical. It's gonna be a science fiction | 1015.444722 | 1061.622847 |
| SPEAKER_3 | hypothetical. | 1061.622847 | 1062.122847 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But what I always like | 1028.294682 | 1063.482817 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I'm I'm I love hypotheticals. | 1063.5628470000001 | 1064.622847 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I always like to look at, like, the the robot problem. Right? Like, let's say we invent the ability to take our conscious mind and put it in a robot. It's no longer in our body. It's in a robot operating a robot. Well, now who is you? Are you the body that's left behind lifeless and non able to move, unable to think, unable to do all that. Or are you the robot? And then taking a step ahead, what if we take somebody who's who's, unable to, like, somebody who's unable to move their body Right? They're they're fully in a catamount | 1031.2347220000001 | 1098.962847 |
| SPEAKER_3 | extended family. | 1099.102847 | 1100.0828470000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And put their brain in meat. Are they now me, or are they just them in a different body? | 1066.2347220000001 | 1105.552847 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. That's why I think they're both, equal they're connected. They don't, like, intrinsically, and so they would have the same value. | 1072.444722 | 1114.842847 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, no. What I'm what I'm saying is we have to look at, like, what we what we place the value on and what I think we place the value on is the conscious Because I would argue if somebody else's consciousness comes into my body, they're not me. They're not. There's somebody else. They're not. We would place value on it based on | 1081.334722 | 1131.482847 |
| SPEAKER_3 | militarianism. Yeah. So we would we would we would go down the 4th house with the 4th house. Yeah. Okay. I'll | 1131.892847 | 1136.662847 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that's yeah. We would we would go down the utilitarian route because that body still can serve a purpose. But in in, | 1102.594722 | 1144.342847 |
| SPEAKER_0 | That we can just go as we can go wherever we want. Because what we're talking then is, like, the potential for human life. Right? It has the potential to become a human being. Like, I can take that super far back. I can take that back even further than sperm. It's | 1180.202981 | 1192.422981 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a I sperm has the potential | 1192.422981 | 1194.0429809999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You can go back further. When when a man meets a woman and they love each other very much, all of a sudden, the potential for human life explodes. Mhmm. So that's why I worry about potential. Yeah. | 1194.5629809999998 | 1204.702981 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Potential is a | 1204.762982 | 1205.402981 |
| SPEAKER_0 | slippery slope. You could take it. Exactly. | 1205.402981 | 1207.0129809999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And then you could take even further. Yeah. So I when it comes to I I I still find it hard to to place value at different phases like, as as, like, an inherent value not like a subjective value because, like, I can find I can find you more valuable than Joe. Or invite his personal Yeah. Like, not so not so not like that sort of value, but like a intrinsic value, because it it seems like the the the at the earliest stages of development, because of its dependency and location, it it is not granted the same rights as any other stage of development because there are certain, like, the right to life is something that a born baby has permanent. So why why why do we not at what point Like, is it just my ability? Is that is that the solution? Well well, I believe it's it's | 1207.412981 | 1271.472981 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 24 to 28 weeks because that's when the cerebral cortex forms, and you're able to have the capacity to have, conscious thought. Right? The part of your brain that controls that is he. And now it takes a while for that brain to really, like, like, it's working, and it's it's working out these problems. It just takes a while for it to all to click in and for, like, you know, the mirror test for you to finally go, oh, shit. I'm a person. Like, it's gonna take a while | 1237.1648559999999 | 1296.3129809999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | for | 1296.3129809999998 | 1296.352981 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, the capacity and the start of it working starts about 24 to 28 weeks. So, like, to be safe, I usually just say 24, like, just on the low end. But I think we already, as people, inherently | 1262.204861 | 1307.702981 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Enter the MoneyLion's Bee Scam giveaway. Over 4 1,000,000 is for grabs. | 1349.37247 | 1354.2624700000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So Yeah. | 1356.2624700000001 | 1356.82247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I That is the question. Right? Yeah. Where we get into a little bit of our disagreements. Right? I I believe that prior because it because we placed the we stopped the value at consciousness, I think we have to start the value at consciousness. I don't think we can start the value in a place different than we end the value. See, but we don't we don't stop the value of consciousness. We because the court | 1356.9824700000001 | 1379.34247 |
| SPEAKER_3 | just have rights. | 1379.56247 | 1379.9724700000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Well, so corpses cannot | 1379.9724700000002 | 1381.4924700000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | demonize a corpse. Corpses | 1381.4924700000001 | 1382.7324700000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, people have. And and a lot of the times, mostly corpse rights are because of, like, the family and stuff. So you get you pay you pay respect to the family by not violating the corpse and things like that. But when it comes to whether the corpse can live, right, like, that's why we talk about, brain dead people a lot because it's the same sort of thing. Because that consciousness is no longer there, we recognize that even if the body is still alive and we could keep it alive on life support indefinitely, We give doctors discretion to pull the plug even sometimes when the family doesn't want to because we recognize that the thing we value, the consciousness, is not coming back. That's the same reason why with comas, we don't pull the plug. Because we have a lot of evidence to show that comatose patients are still conscious. There are a lot of times where comatose And | 1347.3043420000001 | 1427.06247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | they they they they go wake up? | 1427.06247 | 1428.38247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. They wake up. They they they they've woken up and been able to recite whole conversations people had in the room, when they were a coma. Mhmm. So we recognize that our brains are still | 1394.23435 | 1437.86247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | working. | 1437.86247 | 1438.36247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But the second that brain is dead, We pulled a plus. That's why I like to talk about why ask the question why I should value a human body over a human being. I think they're 2 very different things, and I think a fetus can be begin to become a human being until about 24 weeks. | 1404.304349 | 1462.572466 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So I'm gonna pose a a a high exam. It's gonna be a extreme one. So just but but I think it makes the point if if a girl is passed out on whatever reason. She is unconscious. And does not and will not wake up. I'm at a party, but she's still alive. And and somebody essays her And then and and but then there but then she's not sore afterwards. Doesn't even know it happened. She wakes up the next morning thinking it was all good. Like, nothing nothing happened. Would you think that it was wrong? Yes. | 1462.572466 | 1466.284345 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So because | 1467.244345 | 1502.43247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But the reason I was So hold on. Because it's her body. Yes. Off those all up. My mom's running away because just because you're | 1502.87247 | 1509.86247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | doesn't mean your conscious mind isn't still working. Right? Like, but the subconscious is your like, dreaming, | 1475.554345 | 1515.7224700000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, your conscious mind. She wasn't asleep. Like, she was unconscious, not out on drugs. Like, | 1516.02247 | 1486.674345 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you | 1520.98247 | 1521.46247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | know, even on | 1521.46247 | 1521.70246 |
| SPEAKER_1 | even unconscious. I think, like, when we're | 1521.7824600000001 | 1524.2624700000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | think there's | 1489.954345 | 1524.98247 |
| SPEAKER_0 | still like | 1524.98247 | 1491.584345 |
| SPEAKER_2 | a When | 1525.89247 | 1526.73247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | we look at the loss of consciousness, I look at 2 two specific things. I look at, did they have previous consciousness? And will that previous consciousness return? If they have previous consciousness, right, I'm going to respect that, and it and it is going to return. I'm gonna respect their body in this, paused state. I'm going to give them the respect that they asked for when they were previously waived. That's why, like, I I would if somebody signs a GNR when they were previously conscious, they specified they didn't wanna be brought back I would respect that decision that they made when they were previously conscious. So because when she was pre previously conscious, he didn't wanna be samed, I would say you can't SA ed her when she is in a brief period of unconsciousness. | 1526.73247 | 1570.56246 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. That that that that's fair. But it's like, if she were and and she and she lived the rest of her life and she never knew. All that all that was the violation was was of her body. Because she never knew. She never never knew when she lived 80 more years afterwards. And never learned about it. And and so I would say that the violation was I mean, I I understand And, obviously, this is not, like, my rational belief. Right? I know. But it's like, the longest line of thinking, it's like her body the only thing adversely affected. | 1537.114345 | 1603.14247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. But she still has bodily autonomy, and she gets to determine while she's conscious, she gets to deter like, while she has a conscious human mind, she gets to determine what happens | 1569.254345 | 1612.6124300000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to her. That. Okay. Yeah. That that makes sense. Okay. Yeah. Because then and that's, like, that's why you went to the DNR. Okay. Now I'm connecting the dots. Sorry. I I my my brain is tired. I I shouldn't have done my live. Knowing that I was gonna come on here. But it's Is it? I know I I I I just don't know. I'm gonna look it up as I ask this. Is it illegal to move a | 1612.6124300000001 | 1649.15247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | not necessarily. Depends on the the situation. Like, if my grandfather dies in his bed, it wouldn't be illegal for me to move him down the for the like the paramedics to take him to the morgue. Right? It's only illegal if it's an active seen | 1617.084345 | 1632.984345 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Okay. And I I was saying, like, after they were buried, because, like, I you know, I know you can't can't dig them up, but it actually you can in most states, like, transport even to, like, a different cemetery. And so I guess Because they they bestow those rights onto the family to make those decisions. | 1633.144365 | 1683.78247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. And | 1650.064345 | 1684.77247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | so I guess it it really isn't even the rights of the corpse per se. It's just it's the rights of the family And what they want to do So I guess that kind of erases that lineup. Rationale. | 1684.77247 | 1663.604345 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. And then and and so just so you know, I believe when we die, we shouldn't have the rights to the corpses like we give them mean, personally, I think we're wasting hundreds of organs that could go to people that need them and that would, like, die because they're on a waiting list for a heart. So I think it's I I I think if you're a, I think you not an organ donor, you're a little selfish, but I I I think we should | 1664.344345 | 1721.67249 |
| SPEAKER_2 | be | 1721.67249 | 1722.17249 |
| SPEAKER_1 | maybe not harvesting body parts off of dead bodies, but, like, we really need to start considering if these organs going to waste is actually a good thing, and I would say it's not. | 1688.574345 | 1732.55247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. And and and a part of me is wondering if my if if if the way that I place a moral consideration on a zygote. If that is rooted in my I think it's so this is like, it's rooted in my spirituality. And I think that is probably the answer. I would have to think more about it, just because, like, the more I think about it, because a lot of it is Just like my belief said. Right? Because I also think, like, a parent mean, because I think the this this obligation, this moral obligation from a parent's offspring is permanent. | 1699.6843450000001 | 1769.4724700000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Mhmm. Perfect. | 1735.704345 | 1771.1525000000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I got and I think most parents would would morally agree and understand, like, like, most friends would say, like, hey. I would jump in front of a bus to save my kid. Right? I mean, that's a a common, like, protective instinct of parents. But I would say that we are all Okay. As parents to do whatever it takes, including in in extreme cases, sacrificing ourselves to extend the lives of and that and I and I and I'm and I'm consistent with that across the board. | 1771.53247 | 1804.05249 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So I I think the issue though when we come into, like, the argument on parental obligation is we we have it's very hard to determine where that line is when it comes to parental obligation and who gets to determine that line. So | 1770.484345 | 1819.84247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | for | 1819.84247 | 1820.08247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | example, should you be obligated to give your heart to your child if it means you will die? Under the framework of parental obligation, my immediate thought would be, yes. Under that framework. Like, no matter what, you have to do what you have to do to save | 1820.08247 | 1836.57247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | your child. Whatever it is. | 1836.57247 | 1837.13247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But then that becomes a a very sticky moral issue. Are you morally obligated to give your child their heart if it means you will die? I would argue you're not. And I think it I think it then becomes even bigger if you have multiple children. So then it becomes which child deserves the obligation? Is it right to like, say you have 3 kids. Is it right under the parental obligation framework if one of them needs a heart and you're the only donor, you would have to give it to them but | 1837.13247 | 1867.68244 |
| SPEAKER_2 | then | 1867.68244 | 1867.83247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you are going to have 2 kids that don't have a parent anymore. So which obligation is more important? So I think that's why I can't I can't really get behind parental obligation because it leaves so many holes and | 1833.684305 | 1846.334395 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it's it's | 1880.64252 | 1881.60247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | so flimsy. And I I think no one no one I've ever talked to on the pro life side has ever been able to ground peremptal obligation in, like, any way, shape, or | 1881.60247 | 1889.19747 |
| SPEAKER_2 | form. I I would say this and this is just, like, off the top. Because I've never actually been pushed in that direction in terms of of this. Just like this line of thinking. But I would say that it it always goes to the and I would take the, like, utilitarian approach. Reduce the suffering as much as increase the amount of good that it can do, and so I would equate that to the amount of potential of the of the child. And so in my in in in almost every case, that would be the youngest child. They have the most potential for the rest of their life. And so they would always the what however mean, so it's like the oldest is born, They are Mary, Then then the next one comes along? Very. And so on and so forth. Because they provide the most potential in terms of what they can do and experience with their life. And that's just I and and that and that just might be, like, a very personal individual belief of how I believe back to the family. I mean, the and and how important family is. Like, that's I think think having children is the greatest thing I can ever do to this earth. I don't think there's anything I can do on earth that is more valuable to people than reproducing. That | 1889.19747 | 1934.924345 |
| SPEAKER_1 | what I what I would say in response to that is if you take that same logic, I would say it tracks to almost always prioritize the pregnant person over the | 1969.53247 | 1978.23247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | fetus because Oh, yeah. No. That yeah. I agree. | 1944.804345 | 1981.07247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And so then when we look at I would say I would say now we've we've run into the fact of, like, okay. Well, we should always be a warning. Right? Because because under this logic, we know that the person who's living already has been able to sustain their life. We don't know if the fetus can. So, technically, the person that has the best chance is the person who's pregnant because they've already proven that they can sustain it. So I think it's if if you walk that line, right, you walk you walk it straight in. Honestly, you kinda walk it into, antinatalism a little bit. | 1946.844345 | 2013.71247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. And I can see how how how you could do that. And that's why and and that's why I would argue on abortion, it's a and you I mean, you said earlier, like, up to the mother. I think the father's opinion of the pregnancy should matter at least in some capacity, especially if they're married. Alibi outside of marriage is an apartment. | 1981.084345 | 2039.67247 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Right? I think he he should absolutely have an opinion. I just don't think he should be the the | 2005.524345 | 2010.324385 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like the final say. Yeah. | 2044.71247 | 2046.07251 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The the pregnant person has the final say. Otherwise, | 2046.07251 | 2048.73247 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But a a a pretty good question. | 2114.918621 | 2116.6986209 |
| SPEAKER_1 | otherwise, it's it's breaking what consent actually is | 2015.234345 | 2052.24247 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Like, what are we gonna what what if somebody keeps their child up for adoption, I you would I most pro life people say you're a | 2209.910171 | 2215.5337427 |
| SPEAKER_1 | friend of mine. and only the birth parent can provide it? Well, you've already given up that obligation so why should you be have to like, you've already said, I don't wanna be a parent. I gave the child for adoption. And now it come not like, does that parental obligation stay? I think it has to only be legally. I think the only other aspect to do parental obligation you run into way too many too many issues. Yeah. And that and and that brings up a valid point. | 2215.5337427 | 2271.810171 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And I does it's it's it's hard to it's hard to fit in what I believe ought to be into what is. Right now because of how drastically different what I believe what ought to be is. Right? I mean, because and and my in my version of, of reality and and where this is the the where my approach is is universal, and everybody agrees. I would I would say that adoption What like, putting babies up for adoption would not be necessary. Because the, the father would be would always be around. I think because if there's an obligation, is obligated to help not only just So support that child financially, but raise that child. | 2239.2020460000003 | 2330.1101710000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And now so that | 2296.582046 | 2331.770171 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Now | 2331.850171 | 2332.250171 |
| SPEAKER_1 | not only are we forcing people to stay pregnant, we would be like, you you already said you don't want the government making decisions on the body, but you would be okay with the government making decisions on making people stay parents? Because what because then where do we go from there? Right? Like, what if this Yeah. They're a bad | 2332.250171 | 2346.660171 |
| SPEAKER_2 | parent? And and and I don't I don't want I don't wanna make it seem like want the government to force this. This is and and that's where it's hard when when it comes to, like, because this is at the end of the day, this is just, like, my opinions on the matter. Because I I would hope that the government wouldn't need to. That, like, people would like, the family unit and, like, the negative stigma that is often surrounding, like, the family like, we always hear what what do they call it? The nuclear family? I'll I'll really know what that means, but hear it all the time on here. I'm assuming that they're referring, like, the family | 2346.660171 | 2381.890171 |
| SPEAKER_1 | unit. | 2348.502046 | 2349.002046 |
| SPEAKER_2 | If I I yeah. Family unit's | 2350.222056 | 2387.090181 |
| SPEAKER_1 | fine. | 2387.090181 | 2387.520171 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. And so it's like strengthening that family unit and and and and increasing and decreasing how much how many babies are created outside of that family unit would would benefit society in a way that government wouldn't need to mandate these things because all of these things would be how society is raising their children. We're raising their children to be But, hey. We're gonna be in like, the family healthy family union. That's not even necessarily heterosexual. It can be any any strong family unit, but having this sense of, like, responsibility for our families. | 2353.852046 | 2428.400181 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm not saying it's potential sickness trying to put in that more. Right? Because under a pro life stance, We want unwanted children to be born. Right? It doesn't it it under the pro life stance, it doesn't matter whether that child is wanted or not. We just want the life born. And then what happens to the life after the birth doesn't there's really nothing like, it can go up for adoption. It can go into foster care. That's not strengthening anything. But what | 2394.762036 | 2453.330171 |
| SPEAKER_2 | did strengthen | 2453.330171 | 2454.1301710000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it is only having children being born to wanted families. That would lower the rate of, like, domestic violence, that children experience. It would lower the rate of child poverty. It would lower all of this, which would effectively strengthen the family unit. | 2454.1301710000002 | 2468.6101710000003 |

| SPEAKER_0 | I'm just route, obviously, because we're just having an open ended conversation here. I don't I I see the idea behind promiscuity, like, the idea behind it in general as a desigmatizing it to be somewhat sort of wrong. Right? That's right. It's not the generalizing. I think let me I think purity culture in and of itself is, like, inherently harmful. And causes a lot of inherent, a lot of inherent misogyny and I think it very much perpetrates our word culture Even if you may not realize it and mean for it to. I think | 2547.63298 | 2583.11298 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Pure of the of someone pure sort of works their minds. The other issue that we have is that it really my my biggest issue with Perry called is we look at we it removes agency, it's in beliefs. We deny their sexual And that if if they've had any sort of sex, we instantly start viewing them differently and knocking them down | 2614.546422 | 2637.846422 |
| SPEAKER_1 | conversations with, like, LGBT in about sexuality. And and I and I've and I've reverted my stance and come to the conclusion or opinion that human beings I'd like I'd like to hear about this. Human beings are born sexual Explain that a little bit. Wording sends up red flags. Yeah. They are formed with with the innate desire to have sexual intercourse. I wouldn't say born. I'd say they mature for that desire. | 2614.138297 | 2680.616422 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I wouldn't say born. No. | 2647.178297 | 2649.6882969999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So I I would say that they're born they're born with an innate sexual desire that obviously, human development and the development of your sexual organs and maturity, plays into how you express that sexuality. I think we're all innately sexual either asexual or bisexual or whatever it is, the the sexuality or you just you and you yeah. Fluent sexuality. Okay. | 2650.338297 | 2677.1282969999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So just so I can just so I can understand, because I wanna try to get this this wording | 2711.4364219999998 | 2715.436417 |
| SPEAKER_2 | right, what you're saying is that as a species, when we are born, there's a component of our brain that will either grow into a sexual being, an asexual being, or something in between the two. But that exact portion of our brain is always there. Yes. | 2715.436417 | 2697.698297 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. It's like and I wouldn't even know if it | 2732.306427 | 2733.9864279999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Got a word. | 2734.066422 | 2734.896422 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. Yeah. The the way I word it is probably for it. Some a fairly | 2701.8782969999997 | 2740.0364219999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | very | 2740.336426 | 2740.736422 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It's it's a very new, like, idea that I've been wrestling with. Because it's like, the because then our expression of it like, I can express my sexuality with, if I'm attracted to men, homo sexually. If I am attracted to women, I can express that sexuality through heterosexuality. Right? And and and people can express their sexuality in in many different ways as as these topics are more openly discussed. Right? We're learning about all different types I sexualities that people have. And | 2706.908297 | 2742.048307 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I I always say, are you are you just just trying to say that, | 2742.9382969999997 | 2780.2864219999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, you're either born you're born with whatever sexuality you're born with, | 2780.2864219999997 | 2783.966422 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Is that really is because that feels more like what you're trying to say is just you're born gay, you're born straight, you're born ace, you're born | 2749.8982969999997 | 2790.696422 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I wouldn't I don't know I don't know if I would agree that that you're you're born homosexual. I I I I because but I would say that you can be shaped by sort of, like, like, your with, like, nature versus nurture, like, by your surroundings. To adhere to that at a very young age. But I I I wouldn't I I I | 2758.008297 | 2819.006422 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I Well, | 2819.006422 | 2819.2864219999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I would like to push back | 2819.2864219999997 | 2820.566422 |
| SPEAKER_2 | on that. | 2820.566422 | 2821.2264219999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I think it's very it's very clear with research that, like, like, nay nurture has no effect on human sexuality. Right? If our case, no gay person was born to convert to parents. It just wouldn't happen. Like, I think it's very clear that we are born a very specific, with a very like, not to repeat what you said, but but our sexuality is basically | 2787.328297 | 2844.096422 |
| SPEAKER_2 | already in entrenched in our DNA when we're born. So it's already written. The code is written. It's just what at what time the code will start expressing it. | 2844.156422 | 2852.566422 |
| SPEAKER_5 | HealthCare.gov has plans for health because you have plans for life. All plans cover doctor visits. And emergency care to keep you and your family running strong. All plans cover hospital Little things. And prescriptions to give you peace of | 2819.298297 | 2867.4564219999997 |

| SPEAKER_4 | New | 2857.9782969999997 | 2858.298297 |
| SPEAKER_5 | season Friday, January 30th at | 2892.606422 | 2893.699752 |
| SPEAKER_4 | 8. | 2893.699752 | 2893.886422 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Black on MTV. | 2893.886422 | 2894.866422 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So | 2860.948297 | 2861.338297 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is there, like, a scientific metric that people have discovered of, like, the of differences between, like, the, homosexual brain a heterosexual brain? | 2862.138267 | 2906.176422 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So there have I haven't looked directly into, the homosexual versus heterosexual brain, but we have seen it in the transgender brain. So for instance, we've done brain | 2872.028297 | 2916.316422 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. I've seen both studies. | 2916.796402 | 2918.176422 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 2884.1682969999997 | 2884.6482969999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So we know we know that people at least when it comes to their gender expression, that is | 2918.9564219999997 | 2924.326422 |
| SPEAKER_3 | 100%, | 2890.3582969999998 | 2890.8582969999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | yeah. And that that's like gender gender dysphoria. It is passed by that. It's like a chem it's like like a mixture of chemical and physical changes like, in the way that their brain is compared to what a, like, in a a trans woman the way that a male's brain is traditionally they have more characteristics that would be associated with the female sex? Yes. But this is | 2926.426422 | 2951.796402 |
| SPEAKER_3 | different than gender dysphoria. So so to correct to just to correct you on this, the gender dysphoria and I | 2951.796402 | 2958.0164019999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | don't wanna I'm not trans. If I say anything wrong, my my trans friends are all watching. They will absolutely correct me on some stuff. But, gender dysphoria cannot | 2958.0164019999997 | 2967.9364219999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | only | 2967.9364219999998 | 2968.4364219999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Can affect trans people and and gender dysphoria is not | 2935.488277 | 2974.146422 |
| SPEAKER_3 | let me re let me rephrase this. Here's what I wanna say. All not all transgender people have | 2940.318297 | 2979.716422 |
| SPEAKER_2 | gender dysphoria. | 2979.716422 | 2980.696422 |
| SPEAKER_1 | They they don't | 2946.818297 | 2981.8464219999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | they don't have it. | 2981.8464219999996 | 2982.886422 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Okay. So Jenny and Sally are on fire specific is correct. Gender is for you means that they have this | 2982.886422 | 2988.836422 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But but, treated with, gender reassignment surgery. Right? Like, that's how you would treat gender dysphoria. But when I'm talking about, like, the deep, similarities between the trans brain and the cisgender brain, so there was a study where they took cisgender men and cisgender women and had them both look at corn and and see the parts of the brain that light up. Now men cisgendered men, when we view porn, like sexually active ones, our brains light up a very specific way, and it tends to light up more than cisgendered women's brains do when looking at | 3033.290827 | 3068.050827 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And when they took a transgender woman, a lot of people would say, well, no. A transgender woman you know, bigots would say that's just a man. Right? When we see a transgender more similarly to their cisgender woman counterparts and not their cisgender male counterparts. | 3033.6627019999996 | 3052.612702 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So if if it was | 3086.9808289999996 | 3087.7808269999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | going to be a thing, where we we say trans women are not true women, their brain would have to light up more similar to that brain of a cisgender man, but it doesn't. | 3087.7808269999996 | 3098.5308269999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. Yeah. It's, like, the way that I just have been able to identify, like, 6 characteristics of the brain. And, like, the study that I read, talked about how transgender women have their, like, sex characteristics on the scale that that the science scientist, like, measure it is very much on the side of, like, a cisgendered male cisgendered woman, compared to man. Sorry. I get so backward sometimes when I A trans woman would would would line up as a cisgendered woman more so than she would a cisgendered man. Sorry. I I guess did. Tired | 3065.9527019999996 | 3112.232702 |
| SPEAKER_2 | of it. You're still new. | 3146.540827 | 3147.6008269999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. Very. Very. And, luckily, I have met a couple of people in within the LGBT, community that I've been very gracious with, trying to help me come to understanding it a little bit better. And so to to to loop this back around because you you where you started to talk about pure purity culture, Mhmm. And I would say that the way that purity culture is done is wrong. It doesn't work. It's very clear that it leads to more problematic things, but I would argue argue that purity culture, it was, not a it was not teaching young men men and women to control their sexual | 3114.1326959999997 | 3186.580837 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Dial topic. I I I I I even looked up like, the National Sex Education and, like, how they broke it down by grade and, like, talking from, like, the bare like, the fundamentals, in kindergarten, like, talking about, like, knowing what bottle the autonomy is. Right? Like, knowing, like, you're your own person. And then and then as it gets more as they get older and more mature, the topic's good. More mature and more diverse. Fair. What specifically are you conservative about? You agree with me a lot | 3224.4035089999998 | 3257.953509 |
| SPEAKER_1 | comprehensive sex education. You agree on, gender identities. What aspect of conservatism like conservatism conservatism, whatever the word is, what aspects of that align with you? Because you're aligning so much heavily with the left when it comes to social. No. I I I I I I am and I would I wouldn't say that I'm a I | 3224.535384 | 3278.553509 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that I'm aligning, | 3244.3253839999998 | 3279.613509 |
| SPEAKER_1 | more so just understanding. | 3279.913509 | 3280.973507 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Because I don't I I don't agree That homosexuality is a healthy way of life. And and personally, And that's just my belief, but I don't want to project that belief onto anybody I and that's why I'm | 3247.525386 | 3299.323505 |
| SPEAKER_1 | projecting that belief. Mhmm. That's a very problematic belief. And I would I would like to know, like, why mean, I I, obviously, I know that, like, you you have a | 3299.323505 | 3310.213509 |
| SPEAKER_2 | very | 3310.213509 | 3310.623509 |
| SPEAKER_1 | extensive religious background, but I would like to know, like, what about your religion specifically? Because I hope as a as I'm I'm I think you you said you're Christian. Right? | 3276.715384 | 3322.103509 |
| SPEAKER_3 | The games are back That calls for an emergency pizza. | 3287.795384 | 3326.303509 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. | 3294.865384 | 3295.365384 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I would hope that, like, we can agree that when we look at literal translation, all the sexual is, like, nowhere in that in that book. Right? When we look at the literal translations, and it didn't really start propping up until, like, the the 19 thirties. | 3330.213509 | 3345.433509 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Homosexuality as a as a identity, as a, As a form of, like, expression in society was not a thing. It it was not it was not talked about at all. And if I was, like, being a homosexual Like, I I people have explained And to me, that somebody can be a homosexual and never have homosexual inter And and that doesn't change their their their mind and their belief and their understanding of themselves in the in in their idea that they are homosexual. So the bible doesn't talk about that at all. It only talks about sexual intercourse. | 3345.433509 | 3413.693509 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Ever as stringent on that. We're we're always stringent on I believe being gay is wrong, and that's the thing in the bible we should we should keep. And not and listen. At the time Yeah. Most Christians do that. I agree. I don't do that. Mhmm. Personally. Most Christians I I get that you are not you absolutely do not wanna push your beliefs on other people, but I think it's important to, like, when you have, like, belief like this that I would say are a little bit problematic, we sort of analyze them and if there's any deeper meaning or any way that we can, like Yeah. Come to resolve there. I would say with at the time the Bible was written, | 3446.642363 | 3480.3023630000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | homosexuality and gay sex because and and if I'm wrong about this Most | 3447.804238 | 3485.6623630000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | of the time, | 3485.6623630000004 | 3486.062363 |
| SPEAKER_1 | they're a s a. Yeah. But also almost always, SA Another thing was their their diss the dislike of the Romans. So another aspect of it came into came into because if you look at the store if you look at the bible, I mean, you can really pinpoint certain groups of people that the bible was trying to be written to weed out the time that it was written. So, like, for example, the Romans were very sexually fluid. Like, very | 3486.062363 | 3514.052357 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Well, | 3514.212363 | 3514.292363 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that's the testament. Old testament, it'd be more eat the Egyptians and and the Egyptians were very heavily The | 3514.292363 | 3520.942363 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Egyptians were was a very long empire. So, like, the Romans popped up. The | 3520.942363 | 3527.3523680000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the earliest form of Egypt when, like, in the in the old testament, in the verse that we're discussing, it's when Egypt What have, like, dominion and, enslaved the Israelites, the | 3527.3523680000003 | 3539.562363 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Jewish people. | 3539.562363 | 3540.1423680000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | And so that's where that but but but I I'm agreeing with you. I A lot of Christians do pick and choose which ones they wanna hop on, which ones they don't. I I view them all same. Now just because I I don't believe that it's the healthiest lifestyle, that mean that it's the wrong lifestyle for you? No. | 3540.522363 | 3558.4923630000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So what about what | 3558.4923630000003 | 3559.392363 |
| SPEAKER_2 | about | 3559.5323630000003 | 3559.692363 |
| SPEAKER_3 | it | 3559.692363 | 3559.9323630000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | as unhealthy? | 3559.9323630000004 | 3560.5123630000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Because I believe that the the most healthy lifestyle that we can choose is one that is, chasing after Jesus' representation of of life. | 3528.004238 | 3574.022363 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. So you're talking about health and, like, a spirituality aspect. Exactly. | 3539.9542380000003 | 3578.122363 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. Exactly. And and that and I and that's from and from my personal experience, that's been where I've been able to find the most happiness, the most confidence, and the most security. In my not only my identity, but just in how I'm how I am to interact with the world. And so I I would I would hold, somebody who is a homosexual how I don't think that that is a healthy lifestyle. In the same light, as somebody who, eats McDonald's 3 times a day and is a glutton. And doesn't live a very healthy lifestyle. I would I would hold them without one. I I I would I I I used to be a big fan of McDonald's, but not not much anymore, but I would hold both of those, like, equally in in terms of unhealth. I'm like, that is just not the healthiest way that we could that we could live our lives as human. | 3578.1823630000004 | 3625.862363 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Do you not do you not think it's more unhealthy to repress That stuff? Would say it's actually it's actually way more unhealthy, like, depression would be. Right? Because not only then are you gonna face actual things, | 3591.714248 | 3638.582363 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Was the price about my belief about the afterlife? Interesting. Well, that would That that goes into a much more pillow soft conversation, about time. The and we we can touch on it later, but I wanna respond to to to you here. It's I I and all of this stems from my belief that aligning ourselves with Jesus he can heal certain aspects of our heart that don't align with him. And, a, and here's the purest way | 3683.642141 | 3717.9521409999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And that is, just in my experience, that's been that's been the reality for me, and I've tried a lot. I I I I I did drugs for a long time. I had a bunch of sex for a long time. I I engaged in all sorts of nefarious activities and trying to find fulfillment and satisfaction or whatever but I felt like no matter where I looked, I was always left unsatisfied. And wanting more. And then I found I found Jesus, and and and I didn't have to look any further. Saw completely and wholly satisfied with who I am, and what I am supposed to do on this trip. I don't know that that that that experience would be universal. Because I believe that that Jesus didn't just do those things for me. I believe he did them for everybody, including those who don't even believe that he existed. Now we can get into a metaphysics debate, if you want. Yeah. And and and the reality is is none of none of my beliefs matter. And at the end of the day, none of none of none of those beliefs are relevant at all. Because Jesus never told told Christians to go and and force our way of life onto people. Now He said are not to conform to the patterns of this world. Meaning, whatever the patterns are, we are to not conform to them but we are also not to try and force our way of life onto them either. We're supposed to go into those | 3683.7073459999997 | 3807.902141 |

| SPEAKER_1 | doing that, I'm like, come on, dude. Play the game, like, right. I mean, like, when I'm already the biggest, like, there's no need for you to just, like, eat everything when you're, like, not that big. Like, just be a team player and help rebel, I guess. | 10.840000000000003 | 58.45812500000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I | 24.550004 | 24.630005999999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't know. It's just kinda weird. I don't get mad when little kids do it. I don't get mad at all. I just think it's weird. Being greeny as an adult. | 58.938131 | 68.698115 |

| SPEAKER_2 | with the CIA. I think the CIA bad. I what the CIA has been doing, even even now is is very bad. I don't like their foreign intervention. I think it makes the United States as terrible. So when you think back, like, let's say you said | 117.09808499999997 | 164.078125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | there | 164.078125 | 164.15812500000004 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Between persons? Yeah. It might it might be like, you you have well, it might be you | 136.56999999999994 | 175.418095 |
| SPEAKER_1 | have | 175.418095 | 175.578125 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Right? | 186.938125 | 187.37812499999995 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Yes. I, I I believe I believe the reason we have money is that we can invest. That's why I believe why Why | 159.41995999999995 | 199.14812500000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | do we | 199.14812500000005 | 199.30812500000002 |

| SPEAKER_2 | reason why we have money is liquidity. Liquidity. It's very important. So what happens is is that when you have a barter let's say, for example, that you have tomatoes, and I have cigarettes, and I wanna I want potatoes, but all you doesn't have is to wait until I get very | 202.948125 | 183.56999999999994 |
| SPEAKER_1 | solid | 219.05812500000002 | 219.12812499999995 |

Is the not attack the hyenas in defense? There is no different from the way that capitalism plays packaging socialism to quote not be easy, then certainly that there is 3 4 country. Tried in over 57 countries who failed in 101, say for for Vietnam, Cuba, and Venezuela. Though I doubt I would consider any of these to be a successful is by far the fastest in the time we have. Assuming a material dialectic, I could even argue a technocratic where people don't have to work much due to extreme motivation, but that would be an entirely different discussion.

Based on the private ownership of the means of production, and they are often also our solution is an economic system in which the means of production exchange are collectively owned by the class. I like to to to distinct what those means of production are These would be land, labor, capital, and, tools and technology. These these 5 things would be, just the basis of the production.

| SPEAKER_1 | Oppression is also quite literally disabling and often limits one's access to all these social determinants of health that we all could have access to if it wasn't for this economic system that we find ourselves living under. People who have no or limited access to the aforementioned things often because their communities are intentionally kept in poverty become disabled and higher rates than people who do have stable access to those things. In the US, we see higher rates of disabilities in 5 through 64, are disabled. Compared to 35.5 of black and Hispanic adults in that same age group. Trans people also have higher rates of disability than their cis counterparts. 2020 22 study found that when confounders are controlled for, transgender adults have a 27% chance of having at least one disability at age 20 and a 39 percent chance at age 55. Is nearly twice the rate of their cisgender counterparts at both ages. Mortality rates are also higher among trans people, and cis people get higher among black people and white people, as depression is disabling. According to abolitionist scholar Ruth Musa Gilmore, raising | 9.065 | 116.765 |
| SPEAKER_1 | In the US, 50% of people killed by law enforcement are disabled. And more than half of disabled black people have been arrested by the time they turn 28.

You literally only need to look at the case study of a millionaire who sold off all his assets and intentionally became homeless so that he could prove that he's on that stigma that Ryan said and could make $1,000,000 in a year to see this disabled into action.

| SPEAKER_1 | Thought about it, but | 297.11 | 332.71812500000004 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I want to identify the patterns that keep us in a cycle of conflict where it's the same thing that they're like. Figure out, like, what the triggers are for Both of us? Learn how to support one another like, to get to figure out, like, how we don't do that to one another. Encourage one another to share our feelings, plan for future conflicts. Mutual goals for resolving issues, may clear our expectations, And agree on what our relationship means. Clear the clear the air of things on one another's minds, figure out what we do instead of harm, rebuild trust, improve communication, and understand one one another's feelings.

| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. His argument didn't make meme shit at all, but alone, like, on its own, this is an argument that people used to make this point. He was not making that point very well. At all using it. By using it, I don't he farted again, him trying to use | 603.14996 | 649.8781250000001 |
| SPEAKER_5 | it | 649.8781250000001 | 650.2481250000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And then other things you said didn't actually | 617.06 | 653.648125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | go along with what along with that idea necessarily at all. Because, like, it's a no shit, no, I'm in, but he never argued for, like, as to why that would mean that the issue isn't addressed to still | 653.648125 | 668.118125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I don't know. But | 635.07 | 670.418125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Mhmm. | 670.668125 | 671.048125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Just in | 637.91 | 672.538125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | general, like, | 672.538125 | 673.438125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | sort of about race. I mean, we did you did at first, it was not good. The talking the rice conversation about whatever. At first, it was not good. It it evolved into the same. Same kind of, like, | 640.65 | 691.178125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | thing. | 657.4 | 657.9 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. And, you know, and and even, like, LGBTQ plus stuff, things like that. So, like, remember on New Year's last year, you were like, I don't know. Something about being not about trans people. And I was like, you're not allowed to be anti trans. Yeah. I mean, we didn't necessarily fight about it, but yeah. So what | 659.94 | 689.74 |
| SPEAKER_0 | do you think? | 724.048125 | 724.868125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, what else what am I not mentioning that you that you actually have been that you know you've consciously been doing | 691.1 | 732.1381250000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Like, I mean, I do know that you're trying for sure. I know that you want to. | 698.15 | 737.068125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Make | 703.4 | 703.48 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it | 737.788125 | 738.038125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | work. | 738.038125 | 738.468125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, I just I don't know if fucking like, things that, like, I've been doing, | 705.92 | 748.348125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know. Just do you have what do you have to say to that? I guess, do you have anything to say? To | 714.28 | 719.31 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that? I'm I'm glad that you noticed that, like, I'm I'm trying and that, like, I'm being more receptive instead of, like, combative towards new ideas and shit. Am I seeing things for, like, what they actually are and not just, like, that are shitty way they've been explained to me? | 753.618125 | 776.788125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 744.76 | 744.92004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I feel like that sort of sounds bad because | 779.228165 | 782.528125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | not what you said. | 748.37994 | 783.848125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But I feel, like, bad because I'm, like I mean, it's not like that I'm trying to | 749.69995 | 788.118125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | make you like, as if, like, that what you think now is wrong and what I say is correct. So you should like, not for that, like, really, it's | 788.118125 | 798.7381750000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. But you | 766.07996 | 801.028125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I guess it's like just engaging in critical thought. | 801.188125 | 769.3 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yes. The question why. And, | 804.068125 | 805.988125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | like, when | 805.988125 | 806.228125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it comes down to it, I don't have a fuck fucking reason for half the shit I fucking think. And, like, if you give me a y, you'd blessing my fucking game. For real? I I I don't have much to say about because I it's like information overload to begin with. | 806.228125 | 834.978125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. I'm sorry. I | 834.978125 | 836.448125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | got | 836.448125 | 836.478125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that is true. And, | 802.41 | 837.7581250000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, I just need a I need, like, a little bit of time to, like, Digest. You know? | 837.7581250000001 | 843.728125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Mhmm. No. I I know that, actually. | 810.05 | 846.218125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | So then I wanna talk about Don't be I don't like I'm not trying to attack you or anything like that or bring up or rehash, like, all our I just want you to, like, | 820.09 | 867.028125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | realize the pattern | 833.51996 | 868.988125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | and tell me, like, what | 835.16 | 870.768125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, I think there's a reason why you do it. And I think we just need to figure out that reason and work through it. But | 838.28 | 846.89 |
| SPEAKER_0 | dismissing Like, dismissing me. I mean, maybe it's just like a | 848.17004 | 887.808125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | cultural thing, like, as in just we're not supposed to be taken seriously because we're just openly emotional women. I don't think that's the case. I hope not. I hope that's not the case, but there's a reason that you just dismiss my like, everything I'm saying | 854.15 | 902.938125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | or anything I'm saying that I have an issue with. | 902.938125 | 905.048125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Well, | 871.06 | 871.54 |
| SPEAKER_4 | like, | 905.848125 | 906.1281250000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Right right out the gate is what you just said. Like, it's not don't have, like, an automatic dismissal just because you female or anything like that. | 872.91 | 915.6381250000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I | 881.49 | 881.99 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I like I said, my mom was the breadwinner and the fucking housekeeper. In my family. So, like, I truly respect the fucking the feminine form, and I'm not just gonna oh, she's talking again? | 882.43 | 931.088125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | No. | 897.44 | 897.94 |
| SPEAKER_0 | It's it's | 932.788165 | 933.3881250000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | wonderful. How how cute. No. Like, I mean | 933.3881250000001 | 935.688125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's not what I'm talking about, | 935.8881250000001 | 937.288165 |
| SPEAKER_2 | though. No. But, like, that's that's, like, the extreme case of dismissal. It's like, oh, you're talking that's cute. You know? No. I I don't ever think no shit anywhere near like that | 937.288165 | 947.418175 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I know. But I think I think | 913.79004 | 949.618125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I think we're news. You're addressing is me saying, like, you're getting mad over nothing. It's | 949.618125 | 921.79 |
| SPEAKER_4 | the the | 924.39 | 959.518125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | what I mean when I say that, it's like it's like okay. The the the topic is whatever the topic is. I can't think of a specific example right now. But, like, that topic as far as you and I and our relationship and how we conduct ourselves that topic has literally nothing to do with the way me and you see each other and that's why I say, like, you'd get, like, you're getting mad over nothing because, like, it's not it's not that you don't you shouldn't care about whatever the topic is. It's just that, like, the fact that we're fighting over it and we're getting mad at each other over a topic that literally does not intersect with our lives between me and you, like, in this house, if literally This is the only time it'll be mentioned. Is this argument type shit. That's why I say, like, you know, it's like, why are you getting why why why are you getting so fucking mad over this that, like, doesn't truly affect | 925.67 | 1031.538125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | the situation? Point | 1031.538125 | 1032.418125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | when you do that, it's not even about the thing anymore. It's the fact that you get defensive about | 1032.418125 | 1037.2180250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | it. | 1037.2180250000001 | 1037.488125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And that you don't legitimize, like, | 1003.7401 | 1040.628225 |
| SPEAKER_0 | me having any kind of, like, | 1007.1599000000001 | 1042.9481250000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | concern with it that I'm trying to address with you and what you said So it's a thing | 1009.6800000000001 | 1048.9082250000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | of, like, | 1048.9082250000001 | 1049.618125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | well, what do you think it does when you say like, what does it mean when you say that? Why do you say that? If it's not because you want to stop the conversation? And because it's something I shouldn't be worrying about or you shouldn't care about | 1015.4701 | 1060.588025 |
| SPEAKER_2 | or No. I'm I'm I'm saying it should it's not something that me | 1060.588025 | 1063.628125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | and you | 1063.628125 | 1064.028125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | should be fighting about. | 1064.028125 | 1065.2280250000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I know. So when you say that | 1065.2280250000001 | 1066.498225 |
| SPEAKER_2 | saying that not saying that it's something that you shouldn't care about. Because, like | 1066.738125 | 1071.208125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But that's all I'm trying to do is address it. I'm not trying to fight about it | 1071.328125 | 1074.048125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | either. | 1074.048125 | 1074.368125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | If | 1074.368125 | 1074.528125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | anything, | 1074.528125 | 1074.998125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | It shouldn't be a big deal. You're correct. So I don't understand why having the having the talk makes you defensive. | 1041.5 | 1081.088125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You're right. It's not a big deal. But the fact | 1047.31 | 1084.008225 |
| SPEAKER_0 | we're fighting about it is because there was something you got defensive about. | 1084.008225 | 1087.318125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Typically, like, when I get defensive, it's because I feel like you know, I mean, offensive. Like, when when you, like, | 1056.48 | 1099.4481250000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Immediately, when you say something with attitude or tone, then I'm just like, why the attitude? Why the tone? Like, why the face? I always do it, right, when you say it. So why don't you do it then? | 985.53359 | 993.39359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know. Because, like, I have tried to do that before. I have tried to say that you're, like, coming at me with, like, | 994.033591 | 1000.46359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | No. You don't. You do not say it immediately when I do it. You don't. | 1000.94359 | 1003.89359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I I have I have at least once before. At | 1004.37359 | 1007.813589 |
| SPEAKER_0 | least once? | 1007.813589 | 1008.713588 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm just saying, like, I can't put a number on it, but I know that I've And, like, it didn't necessarily go over well. | 1008.8535899999999 | 1016.13359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I don't know what you're talking about. I don't remember this. I think where | 1016.84359 | 985.735465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you said this to me and I was already mad, that doesn't that's not the same thing. Of course, if I already mad because I tried to address something very simply with you that like, I don't understand why was something you got defensive about or, like, Socket. I mean, just, like, I don't know. I mean, You can't, like, expect me to be, like, calm and everything after, like, we've just ended up in a fight about something that shouldn't have been a fight, and then I don't know why you get defensive about in the first place. | 985.975465 | 1058.83359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The the best the best response to the best answer from my defensiveness is, like, 5 I feel like I feel offended. I can't fucking pinpoint why with a specific example or anything | 1025.425465 | 1075.16359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. | 1041.175465 | 1041.3354709999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But, like | 1075.643596 | 1076.04359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, not not that hot. It's just you just been you being you dismissing me. In what I'm talking about. But, yes. | 1076.2835949999999 | 1087.123584 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Right. It's not I don't I don't ever try to dismiss what you're saying because I value your opinions and shit. The thing that I, like, try and fucking that you're calling me dismissing your feelings and everything is like, just the fight in general itself. It's like, Wait. That's the only thing that, like, I'm trying to, like, fucking get out of. | 1087.123584 | 1108.41359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | We're not fighting at that point. We're not fighting because of what I said what I brought up initially at all. What we're fighting about is the fact that you don't care about what I'm saying and that you've dismissed me. That is what we're fighting about. And that you never you you just dismiss. Like like, if I am it doesn't matter, like, like, you saying that does nothing. But harm the situation. It does nothing. It like | 1074.105465 | 1102.495465 |
| SPEAKER_2 | just | 1136.80359 | 1136.88359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you're getting you you get mad about, like, nothing. You're getting mad over anything. It's not even a big deal. Why do you wanna fight about this? Something like that. Like, I'm not even trying to fight with you. That kind of thing is dismissing Me caring about something that is simple enough, I think possibly or could be, but because you don't want to, like, because you don't wanna talk about it, you just dismiss anything. Like, you dismiss me like, once by just, like, not understanding your saying, like, that you're confused or whatever, but | 1103.765465 | 1171.94359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | How how is that a dismissal? Like, if I if I was genuinely don't understand something, it's not me dismissing | 1138.035455 | 1179.01026 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, because saying that does nothing but end the in progress. It does nothing to move it forward. | 1179.27693 | 1184.78358 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I I would think that you study in my confusion would | 1184.84358 | 1188.70359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | How do I know what you're confused about? Shouldn't you seek to ask questions to be sorry. I didn't mean to take off. | 1154.955465 | 1194.35359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Right. When you told me that I'm confused, it means that like, I'm not I'm not following the same path in your words that you're intending because, like, if I I we verified understood what you were saying, you'd be, like, on the same path as far as, like, the conversation goes. But, like, you're saying something and, like, I just don't follow, and I'm like, fucking wait. Wait. What? Like, I I missed something or whatever, and I'm confused. Like, me stating that I'm confused. This is me saying okay. Stop talking? | 1160.685465 | 1227.65359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I didn't say you're telling me to shut up, but you're telling me basic by just Saying that and not adding anything else is not you seeking to understand or care about understanding anything You saying that I could literally not say anything else to that because I don't know what your confused about. I don't know what to say. And you literally wouldn't continue. You wouldn't seek clarification on what you're confused about. It would just be the end of the conversation. And also, like but regardless, the part the the actual things I'm it's hard. I'm I am, like, really talking about or whenever you say that I'm making a big deal out of nothing or that I'm getting mad over nothing or that, like, why are you so angry? Like, that kind of thing. It I mean, it doesn't have to mean that I'm actually upset, It could be any emotion that I'm feeling, and it's not a big deal, like, is the most is the more common one that's, like, really infuriating and really dismissive. Because when you say it's not a big deal, I know I know you're not saying you're not explicitly saying what emotion I'm feeling, It doesn't matter, like it doesn't matter, like about the emotion you're saying that I I'm Like, expressing. What matters to me is that whatever emotion I am expressing you think is too much and that it's not warranted. And that | 1194.385475 | 1305.66359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | basically | 1305.66359 | 1306.16359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, any kind of deal that I'm making out of it or wanting to, like, like, address about it is | 1272.505465 | 1313.82359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | an overreaction | 1279.755465 | 1314.96359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So, I mean, what do you what do you think I understand when you say that? I don't ever say that to you. I never say that to you. That's never something I say to you. | 1281.445465 | 1325.46359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Wait. You didn't answer my | 1303.675465 | 1339.10359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | question? I I | 1339.10359 | 1340.16359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I want you to answer my question because I want to know that you actually understand me. Please. | 1306.735465 | 1311.025465 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What what do you interpret by me saying that? | 1312.235465 | 1349.54359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. What does it | 1315.6354649999998 | 1350.9235899999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | mean | 1350.98359 | 1351.01026 |
| SPEAKER_3 | to me when you say it? To me. | 1351.01026 | 1351.63359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. | 1351.63359 | 1352.13359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, whenever I say that it doesn't mean you're overreacting them. | 1318.795465 | 1357.1435900000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Or something along those lines. Right? | 1324.275445 | 1360.22359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Basically saying | 1360.42356 | 1360.66359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the fucking There's level of emotion evoked at the moment is too much for the situation or the thought or, like, the happening or whatever the fuck word is best right now. But bottom line is, like, like I said, you know, to does dismiss you because I'm basically saying that fucking your emotions are unwarranted. And I I I get that now. | 1360.66359 | 1393.87359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | So I mean, I wanted you to understand, like, that part. Like, for sure that like, I wanted you to come to like a understanding about whether whether or not | 1370.285465 | 1413.87361 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you understand that that is actually dismissing me. And telling me that it's not whatever it is that I'm upset about is or that I'm having any kind of emotion over because it doesn't matter, like, that you whether or not you have the emotion correct. It's just the | 1413.87361 | 1428.23359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | dismissing of me caring about it But | 1395.165465 | 1399.065465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You said it right? Okay. You said it yeah. You and you said | 1401.0354849999999 | 1438.72359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | acknowledge it. So, basically, we agree that you don't say that to me. | 1405.665485 | 1446.50359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Anymore. | 1414.715465 | 1414.955465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Or anything like that. | 1449.26359 | 1450.56359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Ever even even this, like, | 1417.1354649999998 | 1453.06359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and then don't tell me you're confused. Ask don't just tell me you're confused because it's kind of along the same lines in a way because I mean, of course, I'm not trying to confuse you, but Because I Like, if you just if it's just a blanket, I'm confused. I don't know where to start. Like, I'm like, okay. At what point did you become confused? Which part are you confused about? Like, I don't know. Like, me, I feel like you're saying that and not giving me, like, specifics on where I should clarify tells me that you don't care enough to, like, actually figure it out. You're not not, like, like, I want you to engage in the conversation and, like, ask me questions. Or but the but in reality, actually, you don't just say it in, like, you don't just say it at times where you just may be confused. | 1420.425465 | 1503.34359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | There are certain times you say this. | 1469.585505 | 1506.23359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And you say this whenever I'm trying to express something that I have an issue with. Like and I'm trying to explain, but you've already tried to, like, defend your position or what you did or, like, how you think or what somebody else | 1476.195465 | 1525.33359 |
| SPEAKER_4 | said that is | 1491.585465 | 1526.45359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | your friend, | 1526.45359 | 1526.85359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I | 1526.85359 | 1527.01359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't know, or the way that they act or something. So Like, when you say it. Whenever I'm trying to explain or whenever we have, like, a | 1527.01359 | 1538.08359 |

Or you being, like, not get oh, I know what it was. Oh, my god. It was It was beautiful, my This was this is after he did everything that he did to | 1549.135425 | 1613.47359 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Everything. Oh, and I fucking sold you and You sold him and you didn't charge him or you didn't charge him for that much, or he thought it was gonna be more. Something like that, something along those | 1579.775465 | 1622.77359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | lines. | 1622.77359 | 1623.10359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And I was just like, Wait. Why, like, why don't you just charge him more or something like that? Like, why would you not? Like, not | 1589.035465 | 1597.665465 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like | 1632.03359 | 1632.30359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like he has the money for it, and I think maybe I don't remember exactly what the disagreement was really, but, like, I was like, well, I mean, you know he has the money for it because like, come on, like, where he lives. And I just | 1598.1554649999998 | 1647.70362 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I | 1647.9435899999999 | 1648.10365 |
| SPEAKER_0 | don't | 1648.10365 | 1648.60365 |
| SPEAKER_3 | know. | 1648.82359 | 1649.15359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And if he's the one who said that You thought it was a low, like, that you're charging him a little. I don't know what it | 1616.425465 | 1657.9435899999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | was. He's he's never said anything about the Quantity, by | 1657.9435899999999 | 1627.655505 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. | 1628.3654649999999 | 1628.445465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Not the quantity that you were charging him less than what he thought he would be charged. What you use? Usually charge or something like that. Or maybe it was, like, he was gonna pay extra 4 he | 1662.75359 | 1638.515465 |
| SPEAKER_3 | gave | 1674.16365 | 1674.32359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | me extra for fucking showing up Wait. Or whatever. | 1674.32359 | 1678.19355 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. There you go. Something like | 1678.19355 | 1679.3935900000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | that. | 1679.3935900000001 | 1679.65359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. Something like | 1645.665465 | 1680.84359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that. He's | 1680.84359 | 1681.25355 |
| SPEAKER_2 | never | 1681.25355 | 1681.75355 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It was something along it was something along the lines of him doing him saying something about paying you more and you not you not are you either saying it wasn't necessary. I think it was just that you said it wasn't necessary or something like that. And I was like, why not? Like, you're taking a lot of risk. You already don't sell to people, like, especially people who can afford you know? So that was, like, me having that is a concern of mine. It is, you know, But, like, but you got defensive about it. And so that and then it quickly like it after I, like after just a couple back and forth about like me saying that, like, why don't you charge? Like, why would you not accept it? Why is it something, like, like he doesn't care about you. He owes you a shit load of money. If anything at all already. Like, don't, like, I mean, you're too, like, you give him too much credit for being a person who cares about you at all. I don't know, like, why don't know. It just it would hurt him, I would not I would say not to do it. Of course, like I don't think you should hurt anybody. But I don't think it will hurt him. So I don't so I don't see like why this person who took advantage of you and treated you so poorly. You should get any kind of, like, Any of your, like, grace in anything and | 1647.785465 | 1759.50359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Mhmm. | 1759.66359 | 1759.78359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Or even benefit | 1759.90359 | 1760.70359 |
| SPEAKER_4 | the | 1760.70359 | 1761.00359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | doubt. But I think it was more I don't even think it was more that, like, you cared so much about me saying something negative about him as you getting defensive because it was somebody | 1726.775505 | 1771.53359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you | 1738.505465 | 1738.585465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | know or | 1772.8935900000001 | 1773.69355 |
| SPEAKER_3 | whatever. | 1773.69355 | 1773.84359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Me | 1774.09359 | 1774.34359 |
| SPEAKER_4 | about | 1774.34359 | 1774.83359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | my business. I think that's what I actually got, like, upset about. It was, like, I I took it, like, fucking you telling me how to do my business | 1740.685415 | 1784.9435899999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Wait. | 1751.835465 | 1752.195465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. Well, then that's a different issue also, though. So but it is still along the lines of dismissing a dismissing me because oh, but part where you said basically, you just we're like, I'm so confused. And so then I just gave up. I was just I was pissed off at that point because when you said that, I'm just like, okay. But you're not gonna, like, try and be not confused, like, I don't know what you're confused about. Really? I didn't know that if that were the case that you had an issue with that, but Right. Why should like, why would you have that those kinds of thoughts? Like, about you know, like, I sat here and waited for you, like, for how right? Like No. I'm So I don't | 1752.675465 | 1827.68359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | know | 1827.68359 | 1827.76359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | how | 1827.76359 | 1828.00355 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you could | 1828.00355 | 1828.24359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | say that it's | 1828.24359 | 1828.88356 |
| SPEAKER_3 | not, | 1828.88356 | 1829.04359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, my place to tell you anything or care about that kind of stuff. | 1829.04359 | 1832.23359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. Like, it it's it's not it's not you, like, at all. It's it's me fucking because I've I've always conducted my business, like, on my own. Like, I've I used to fucking partner up with fucking Jared and shit when we were, like, living together, but, like, I I do not play well with others when it comes to, like, business. And | 1798.825465 | 1861.20359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | my other other | 1861.20359 | 1827.735465 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Nope. They they they just hear hear me out, | 1862.12355 | 1864.8135499999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | please. But don't over but | 1864.8135499999999 | 1866.1735899999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm not I'm not explain | 1866.25355 | 1867.45359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | yourself. Like, if it's then it's wrong. Okay. I just want you to know that. I want you to at least | 1867.45359 | 1871.55359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I I admit that it is wrong for me to fucking, like, Not be receptive to your ideas when it comes to, like, my extracurriculars. | 1837.725465 | 1883.45362 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Fucking because you give fucking solid advice and fucking you're a fucking very smart fucking person, and I respect the fuck out of your brain. So, like, when it | 1851.205465 | 1895.49359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It's not just the fact that you It's not just the fact that you | 1895.61359 | 1896.9435899999999 |
| SPEAKER_5 | It affects both of us | 1864.7155050000001 | 1900.88359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But, like, that being said, the reason why I get, like, upset when I feel like I'm being told how to how to run my business | 1869.0654650000001 | 1913.23353 |
| SPEAKER_5 | is because, like, I've always done it myself. So, like, having somebody who I'm but I'm partnered with in every way it accept that. You know what I mean? Because, like, it's not like it's not like you're going in with me and fucking word | 1879.005465 | 1933.83359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 1899.525465 | 1900.025465 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. | 1935.19355 | 1935.51359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | They're | 1935.51359 | 1935.83359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | good. | 1935.83359 | 1935.91359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's In that respect, it's still it's still my business or whatever. But, like, in every other facet of my life, | 1935.91359 | 1942.78359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | It's how it's | 1909.7554249999998 | 1945.12355 |
| SPEAKER_2 | our business, so to speak. So, like, your | 1911.015465 | 1915.145465 |
| SPEAKER_5 | opinion should weigh just as heavily in the household as in with my business because I respect you to that fucking level but I'm just not used to fucking having that respect for somebody and have having to be 100% completely across the board, so there's no questions asked, like, and that was the wrong way to fucking phrase that. | 1915.785465 | 1976.80359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But | 1943.935465 | 1944.3654649999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | because I respect you I respect your opinions, like, regardless of the fucking topic. But it's just like hearing it was it it just isn't it's not | 1944.925465 | 1991.91359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | easy being | 1991.91359 | 1959.455465 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, told a better way to do things or a way that I should do things when | 1962.045465 | 1966.930465 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I've always made those executive decisions, it's like, myself with no input from anybody | 1968.105465 | 2008.27359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | else. | 2008.33359 | 2008.76359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Oh, I wasn't telling you how you should or shouldn't do anything. I was telling you how I feel about it because it affects me. | 1974.695425 | 2014.53359 |
| SPEAKER_4 | No. | 1980.945465 | 1981.1054649999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But, like, do do you understand how I could take it as No. | 2015.4135899999999 | 1984.285465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Because I'm telling you right now, like, I mean, you explaining it to me. I understood you took it away a certain way that shouldn't have been taken a certain way. But my point is, you can't explain it to me in a way where I can accept the answer. I understand that you thought wrongly and you had the wrong mindset about it and you didn't put yourself in my shoes. I understand that. What I'm trying to get from you is for you to acknowledge that you didn't do that, and that's what you should have done. And then you maybe would have, like, | 1984.525465 | 2047.30359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Is | 2013.155465 | 2013.475465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that | 2047.78359 | 2048.26359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | is that not what I did before I even started to explain myself? | 2048.26359 | 2051.9635900000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, no. Because I don't understand why you explained yourself. Like this. Like, I don't understand. | 2018.155365 | 2056.8135899999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Because | 2057.11369 | 2057.3135899999997 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I'm I'm giving you insight to the person | 2057.3135899999997 | 2059.43359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that that, like, | 2059.43359 | 2060.48369 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I | 2060.48369 | 2060.80359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | am. I get okay. Like, I'm not I'm not | 2060.80359 | 2062.90369 |
| SPEAKER_2 | giving I'm not | 2062.9635900000003 | 2063.76359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | explaining myself as to be a justification for the way that I reacted. | 2029.615465 | 2033.8454649999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. That's fine. But then you asked me | 2068.2135900000003 | 2069.97359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | if | 2069.97359 | 2070.15359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it makes sense as in like that. Like, as in I was supposed to, like, as if you were waiting for me to acknowledge that as if, like I mean, I still won't say I mean, I won't say it's a good excuse at all. Like, I get it. I mean, I understand that there's, like, I kind of get it. Mean, I still don't understand how even at that point, it was a thing where that was your mindset instead of, like, even seeking to understand, like, why I would say something. And especially since I've said it so many times, before, but, like, it affects me too. And so but regardless, I don't wanna rehash that, like, old argument. You me to give you a specific example, and I did. So that example was the giving, like, just being confused kind of thing and that's it. And, like, leaving They're not, like, giving me a way to help you become unconfused about it because I felt like you just didn't care. Enough to be you just were okay with being confused. That's all that that did. It leaves it out of state of confusion. And so therefore, it, | 2035.925465 | 2134.30359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | like, dismisses there being legitimate, like, | 2134.30359 | 2136.36359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | anything legitimate about what I'm saying that you that I feel like you don't care to explore or understand more | 2102.9854649999997 | 2145.84349 |
| SPEAKER_3 | so. | 2146.1435899999997 | 2146.6435899999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So Well, the part, like, what we were just talking about about everything else in in these, like, as a side conversation to the to the example, Let's talk about more, I think, at one moment. Right. Still on dismissal. Basically, if I'm trying to tell you something is important, it's important. Period. I mean, I think we've kind of addressed that, but I just wanna | 2115.5353649999997 | 2184.54359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | reiterate it that, like, you shouldn't think like that Of like, the things I'm saying, it should be like | 2184.54359 | 2191.52359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | do you care about everything I'm saying? Whether or not, like I'm not attacking you. I'm not definitely not, like, I'm not overthinking. I'm not overreacting, and I'm not trying And I'm not trying to fight. Like, that's not what I'm trying to do. I don't want it to be a fight. I wanna it to be like a you're hearing me thing. And I want you to engage with my concerns. So, like, if I tell you something that, like, for example, earlier, Like, I just try to explain how I thought that that the meme or whatever was divisive. I don't know how to approach it where it was a thing where you didn't get offensive been defensive about it. All I said, like, all I said to address, like, something I thought differently from what you thought or from how it was taken I was just trying to tell you that this is how I see this, and so I mean, I could be dishonest and not and just laugh at it, but I'm not gonna do that. And I'm not that person And you told me always speak my truth. So, I mean but times like that where you get defensive when you shouldn't get defensive. I mean, if you don't understand or if you don't like, you could just ask me to explain how but why you would get, like, defensive about it as if, like, like you said like, you said earlier that it's your as if, like, I'm saying that this is your stance and you believe it 100%, like, before I even tell you everything kind of thing. | 2157.225465 | 2282.6035899999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | When | 2248.9355649999998 | 2249.2754649999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, that's not the case. At all. I don't think that you think it, but I'm just trying to explain to you how I see it. And therefore it requires me to I mean, yeah. I I just trying to, | 2249.2754649999997 | 2301.08359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like, | 2301.08359 | 2301.58359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | explain, like, that's what I mean, it's everywhere, always. I don't know. But I just want you to engage with it, I guess, more so. And then if I wrote, if you don't understand it's or if you don't understand I should have said that if if we don't understand or another, it's our responsibility to seek clarification. And | 2268.0254649999997 | 2299.245465 |
| SPEAKER_0 | To | 2299.8004650000003 | 2300.205465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | empathize and put like, ourselves in each other's shoes so that we're not just seeing it so that we don't get defensive. It's easier it's easier to not get defensive if you can understand the other's perspective and see that It's more | 2300.845465 | 2317.335465 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like | 2351.6435899999997 | 2352.1435899999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't know. Just try to empathize first. | 2318.725465 | 2355.7535900000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Alice. | 2322.085465 | 2322.5654649999997 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I guess about, like, how you say I mean, you do say that | 2327.545465 | 2367.7135900000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I dismiss you sometimes, but, I mean, I don't understand, like, when I do that necessarily. I'm not trying to. | 2333.405465 | 2377.51359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And, usually, I won't, like, | 2343.755465 | 2379.48359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | if I do dismiss your feelings, it's because I mean, and it's not necessarily right, but at the point that we're already in a | 2346.135365 | 2391.65359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | escalation, I feel like | 2357.345465 | 2393.1035899999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | We both are definitely dismissing just, like, one another by talking over one another. | 2360.365465 | 2398.69359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | And | 2364.5654649999997 | 2365.0654649999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | stuff. | 2399.43359 | 2399.91359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's | 2399.91359 | 2400.15359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | probably, like, | 2400.15359 | 2400.87359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the | 2400.87359 | 2401.11359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | only | 2401.11359 | 2401.61359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | way I've | 2401.91359 | 2402.15359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I I could really think of that you dismiss anything that that I say is, like, | 2369.375365 | 2407.80359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | whatever. Whenever, like, you ask me a question, and by by try and answer it and you cut me off in the middle of my answer. Like, that's dismissing what I had to say. Like, mean, I answer it, but in the certain number of words, they, like, The | 2374.535465 | 2394.915465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Ryan, don't do that. That's unfair. | 2395.715565 | 2432.04359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I'm just saying, like, because | 2398.475465 | 2434.2135900000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, a lot of times when you cut me off when I'm trying to provide an answer, it's because | 2400.065565 | 2438.47359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I'm, like, long winded in getting | 2404.7754649999997 | 2441.5635899999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | around to, like, the direct answer. And I think that that frustrates you that, like, I don't like straight up just, like, succinctly fucking two word | 2441.5635899999997 | 2452.57359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I never don't do that, Brian. That's not fair. You can't do that. I never tell you how many words It's not that's not what I want. You act like I'm, like, asking you for too much by | 2418.505465 | 2462.18909 |
| SPEAKER_0 | asking for an answer. I'm | 2462.18909 | 2462.94359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | not ask | 2462.94359 | 2463.82359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm not saying that at all. I'm just | 2463.90359 | 2465.52359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | saying that, like Why are you you did. What are you saying right now? Right? Like, if using this, like, as if I asking you for a distinctly specific number of words. | 2431.5353649999997 | 2473.73369 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Because when | 2441.2754649999997 | 2476.30359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I Don't I said, Right. When I get when I get wrong, whiz is not an answer, you probably cut me off. When I don't, like, I I don't know I don't know how to phrase it, but, like, when I if I don't know. | 2476.30359 | 2496.8935899999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Brian, you know you don't answer my questions, though. | 2465.845465 | 2502.8935899999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's the thing, though. Like, I | 2469.7853649999997 | 2505.93359 |
| SPEAKER_5 | tried to answer your questions. | 2472.0254649999997 | 2508.76359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You think that you actually answered my question? Like, so I've never been able to call to you that you don't answer my questions. | 2475.555465 | 2519.1336899999997 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I'm not saying that you never have. I'm not saying that I always do I'm just saying, like, the times that I'm talking about, the times that I have been dismissed, | 2485.795465 | 2529.05359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's what I'm talking about. | 2495.255465 | 2531.02359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But it's because you weren't answering my question. It's because you were, like, trying you were deflecting or something. I mean, I'm not saying every time. I don't know. You're not naming a specific time. You're just saying, like, we cut each other off, but you cut you cut me off all the time, always, like, in fights. Always. I mean, | 2498.5254649999997 | 2550.07359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | but | 2550.1336899999997 | 2550.6336899999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | sometimes I, like, sometimes I say something about it, but Like, you talk about it, like, all the time, it's the only thing you focus on, really. But like, I know that if we're, like, if we're fighting and also, like, you really don't answer my questions. I know what you're doing when you're deflecting. I know you won't answer my questions. But Because of the nature of the fight, I mean, whenever that's just what that's whatever especially when that's all I'm trying to do is get you just to answer the question directly, not indirectly. And you know that that's what I want. It's disingenuous to not just answer the question. When you try and, like, deflect or talk about anything else. It's not, like, to me, I feel like it is actually not answering the question whether or not you're going to get to an answer somehow or another. It's gonna be after you make all of these other | 2516.9355649999998 | 2614.93359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | explanations for it | 2614.93359 | 2616.11359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | something like that, which is not right. Well, I'm talking about, like, dismissing like, actually dismissing your, like, concerns because if we're addressing if we're addressing, like, something that, like, I'm trying to get you to understand or whatever, and me cutting you off because you're not doing that kind of thing, I feel like it's kind of When I'm trying to get you to realize something I'm trying to say, and somehow or another, the focus is always on me and just Like, interrupting and dismissing your thoughts. I'm just like, well, that's just why do you not why do you never, like, talk about or ever get back to, like, the part you play in, like, the dismissal and the whole reason we're fighting in the first place. | 2582.045365 | 2680.38359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I don't | 2666.545365 | 2701.2535900000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | have an answer for it. | 2701.2535900000003 | 2702.5635899999997 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Thank you. | 2682.0555649999997 | 2717.16359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So | 2689.9854649999997 | 2690.325465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | your difference like, just defensiveness I wanna say that, like, I am on your team, I'm never trying to tuck you. I never want to be not on the | 2690.6453650000003 | 2736.54359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | same team. | 2736.54359 | 2737.28359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I wanna | 2703.455465 | 2738.19359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Right. | 2705.595465 | 2706.095465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Just understand. Like each other. I mean, so there's no Like, there's no need to get defensive because I'm not going to, like, like, you can trust me. And you can I don't know? I mean, that's something else that, like, I feel like there is an underlying reason for why. I mean, insecurities I know you say that that is an issue, but I mean, I don't know. Like, you say that, but I don't know if you've actually, like, identified what insecurities or why or when it started or then it's It's not a matter of me trying to win or be right or you be wrong or maybe whatever. Or you not be right or anything. Like, the idea for me is that we both get on the same side of this of this topic. And have a shared truth about it. I wanna have the same truth, not the right. Because then if I'm right, that means that you're what? | 2706.9355649999998 | 2813.1035899999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. | 2779.035465 | 2779.535465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And that's not what I want. That's not good. Goal at all. And it's not an attack. And like I said, it's, like, when I make you feel like that, I want you to immediately, when I do it, stop me and point it out so I can adjust it. And I'm talking about, like, the initial thing, the initial like, me bringing something up to you kind of thing. If I'm saying it in a way that you feel like I'm attacking you, I want you to tell me. But also, like, I Could it be I don't know. It just, like, I don't really understand how you could feel like I'm attacking you, but because I I truly am not, But maybe it's like a insecurity you're, like, projecting onto me kind of thing | 2780.195565 | 2881.32359 |
| SPEAKER_3 | And | 2848.6754650000003 | 2849.055465 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know. But also, like, what are the things that, like, I don't know. I'm talking about before we get, like, before we get into, like, a huge fight or whatever, what it like, | 2850.335465 | 2899.88359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | So that is, like, taking my thoughts on subject and, like, it's, like, they don't align with yours or something, and it's just like automatically fucking to get, like, it's almost like we're in a car lot and you're, like, objection and the judge is, like, | 2911.353271 | 2929.303271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | sustained. Okay. I know. Type the Okay. But can you please okay. Be more specific. If you don't have a specific example that's fine, but like name specific times when, like, for example, this would happen and this happens, like, I don't I wanna know, like, I wanna understand if, like, this scenario, I guess. Like, when we're talking about some something and I'm essentially ignorant to the the intricacies of the time that, like, say, like, say we're talking about fucking Palestine or something that, like, you feel very strongly about, don't think This is just an example of this. I'm pretty sure it's completely hypothetical. But, like, say we're talking about Palestine and fucking I don't know. What the fuck is going on over there and shit. And I just say something fucking stupid, like, or, like, if I if I had heard about fucking because I I still don't fully understand the situation over there. So, like, this might not even be a fucking good example. Like, if I heard about the Palestinian Palestinians killed the people from Hamas | 2929.303271 | 2997.133271 |
| SPEAKER_0 | No. No. It's Palestinian Hamas are the | 2963.175146 | 3001.223271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | resistance fighters for the Palestinians that attacked on October 7th, Israel. Israel. Okay. I mean, they | 2967.235146 | 3007.723271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | were | 3007.723271 | 3007.883271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | yeah. They broke out of their cage. Okay. | 3007.963266 | 3010.043271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So if I had heard about Hamas Killing the Israelis or whatever and not and Okay. As as it was fact that, like, I didn't know about the genocide or fucking how long everybody's been fucking getting cracked up over there. Fucking If I and and if I were pose, like, The argument. Well, fucking, didn't they fucking kill didn't they attack Israel first? Touch it. That That's, like, a time when you might be, like, I I read it as, like, I can't believe he's so fucking stupid, or I can't believe that he would think something so fucking stupid or that he would do something so that's how I interpret it. | 3010.043271 | 3053.553271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Those are the time that I do that? I do that on those days. Like like | 3019.405146 | 3055.833271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like like I I like | 3055.843271 | 3057.243271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I said, that was a that | 3057.243271 | 3058.603271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | was a bad example for, like, it's like, when I'm ignorant to something and I say something that expresses my ignorance and I don't even fucking know it, | 3058.603271 | 3066.213271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's what I'm saying. So you're saying I do that whenever you're whenever you don't know, like, something in it's not like that you're fighting me on it. But | 3032.145156 | 3040.535136 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like just | 3074.843261 | 3075.003271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like when you say something out of pure ignorance and just like like not trying to be like | 3075.003271 | 3079.653271 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But it but it's | 3045.585156 | 3080.239941 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And | 3080.293271 | 3080.453281 |
| SPEAKER_3 | wait. | 3080.453281 | 3080.703281 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Hold. Like something that you think that I should know, though. | 3080.703281 | 3083.903271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm asking | 3049.775146 | 3084.643271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you. | 3084.643271 | 3084.933271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I do this when we are talking when we're talking about social issues in you don't know and you say something and I I scoff at you. You're saying that I do this on social issues or do I do this whenever like, we're fighting about something that's, like, more between us? | 3050.865156 | 3101.2832710000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm It could be either or. I just that was just the first thing that I thought of, like, the social issue. It's not it's not like just like one specific category of conversation that that it happens in But | 3067.965146 | 3086.775146 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I mean, I don't like, laugh in those moments whenever if you're innocently saying something and it's like you don't know, I seek to edgy I don't laugh at you. If I don't laugh at other people, who aren't just being ignorant and actually being hateful and they just literally don't know what they're talking about, I mean, I don't laugh at people. I don't think it's I don't think down on them whatsoever because I am fully aware of the ways that we are made to believe things and what we do and don't know. I know this. I'm perfectly aware of this. I went through this myself. And I had to figure this stuff out. I don't know, like, I would never laugh. I mean, I I would hope I don't. I mean, what if I it? Then point it out when I do it. Please. Like, and I'm talking about, like, on genuine things, I'm just, like, literally making you try to make you feel stupid about something that you couldn't have possibly known. Kind of thing. I mean, I do know that whenever I say LOL whenever, I'm frustrated whenever you've, like, you've not answered my question or something like that. It's not that I'm actually, like, laughing at you or making fun of you at that point. I am just, like, exhausted and just like, it's become, like, a thing where I don't know. I mean, it's not, like, a good response in those times either, but the the whole thing is just already escalated to a point where it shouldn't be the first place. And there is no reasonable, like, reasoning between either of us at that moment. I mean, we should be able to still reason even in moments like that, but I've just | 3087.255146 | 3221.3032709999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 3188.525146 | 3189.025146 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Right. | 3191.435146 | 3191.935146 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So | 3193.445146 | 3193.565146 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So, yeah, if I do it like that. To you. I definitely didn't mean to, and I shouldn't. I should definitely not do that. That doesn't do anything. Except for, like, not make you want to understand anything else. I know that. Like, that's why I would never I would think would never | 3193.7251459999998 | 3247.713271 |
| SPEAKER_3 | do that. | 3247.713271 | 3248.383271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Because, like I said, my goal is to, educate people and especially you because I don't wanna do this on Right. | 3214.875116 | 3230.195146 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So I | 3232.165146 | 3266.793291 |
| SPEAKER_2 | guess what other, like, things you do I do that, like, trigger trigger the escalation, I guess? | 3266.793291 | 3274.483291 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, honestly, I think it's mostly, like, my fucking My my interpretation of, like, your facial and body language Like, it just seems like sometimes, like, So I just, like, I'm fucking I don't I don't even know, like, how to fucking word it because, like, you've never you've never, like, said that, like, I disappoint you or you dis like, or it's just like, for some for some reason, my fucking Like, I'll, like, read it in, like, the like, your your face and your body, isn't it? Like, it's it's, like, almost communicating the same message as, like, I'm fucking disappointing you. In just like the way that I think about things sometimes, like, and I can't think of a specific example, like, | 3244.335146 | 3346.823271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Or a scenario even, like, when I, like, | 3312.755126 | 3349.403241 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Awesome. I got the code. I don't know. | 3331.7851259999998 | 3372.183241 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Can you tell it where I think? Because I I know you say this to me all the time, but it's already after we've been fighting and I'm trying to tell you that you're dismissing me, and then you just talk about, like, explained, like, how your your reaction was justified because of my body language and how I made you feel, but I think it's I feel like like me addressing or me, like, not being okay with something like that Either I've tried to explain to you a 100 times or something or whatever. I don't know. Any kind of thing where | 3342.775146 | 3413.563271 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I | 3413.563271 | 3413.923271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I initiate a initiate a talk about something, like, that I don't like or that I'm not okay with or something, and then I think it's really just that like, you do get defensive about like, you get defensive about, having to I don't know. Like, having to address my concern for some reason, but you know, are you just not wanting to talk about, like, something that I have an issue with, which is so I feel like it's in a way you feel like having the answer to 2 me saying I have an issue with something or that you know, essentially that you're doing something wrong is how I feel like maybe you see it. Because you get defensive about it. Then it must be that, like, I am like, saying these things to you in such a way, and so that's how you just perceive it. But that just goes along with not seeing it as me having an issue with you but seeing a and but being able to empathize with me and just, like, just hear what I'm saying and then care to understand and care to, like, resolve it, ask me questions that I'm not it's not I'm not trying to make you the bad guy or anything. I don't I mean, | 3380.255146 | 3493.603271 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Because | 3465.485146 | 3465.785146 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I mean, I know for sure that whenever you do your tone changes or or you give me this face. I pointed out immediately after you do it, like, at that moment when you do it. So that you know what I'm talking about. But | 3465.785146 | 3481.645146 |
| SPEAKER_0 | So, again, | 3490.315146 | 3525.763271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | do | 3492.625176 | 3493.105146 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you | 3527.413271 | 3527.913271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Do you see what I'm, like, Do you think or see what I'm saying by, like, saying that you're you get defensive and that is one of the core issues and the problems that we have. Or fights we get into | 3496.475096 | 3543.363271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I believe he's 100%. | 3509.295146 | 3544.903271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | How do you think there is a work on fixing it, or how do what do we do? About it? Or how I mean, maybe maybe this talk is | 3513.625176 | 3555.613271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to be more receptive to what like, I need to be more receptive to your messages and not just, like, fucking The market is about circuits, like, not even meant to offend. Like, if I'm if you're not meaning to be offensive at all, then I shouldn't Fucking take it as offense and fucking does. You know, subsequently fucking get defensive because, like, that's that's my shit. Like, fucking me fucking taking things that, like, aren't offensive offensively and getting defensively because of them. Is not you doing anything Wow. This is me fucking getting in my fee feeds about shit that's not supposed to be fucking felt that way. | 3556.013271 | 3615.853271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. But also, like, what do we do about it? In a way that I mean, I know you're saying that you need to not do that, but, like, why do you think that you get defensive or offended by me trying to tell you how I feel about something? | 3582.385146 | 3633.153271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know because | 3603.575146 | 3639.0332710000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I mean, do you think that me telling you that you're doing bad and I disapprove, like, Basically, | 3606.295106 | 3614.085146 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. | 3615.035146 | 3615.535146 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And, I mean, I I know that's probably due to, like, past traumas, so know, experience in your life. | 3619.2251459999998 | 3661.673271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But | 3628.405146 | 3628.865146 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But you have to, like, I mean, I will do whatever you need me to to, like, fix it. To help you fix it, to help you get through it, | 3632.855146 | 3676.273271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | but | 3676.273271 | 3676.423271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it's something you have to reflect on. | 3642.5151960000003 | 3678.593271 |
| SPEAKER_3 | That's that's | 3646.2051460000002 | 3681.813271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I don't know. Was going on and do it with you, whatever. | 3649.615146 | 3686.943311 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I wanna do it with you. And then you let me say that This shit came fucking black. They they still have a great a shitty man. | 3654.775146 | 3704.443271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's that's dark art. That would've been a lot darker. | 3675.275146 | 3713.883271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That would like this one. Still having so much | 3681.365106 | 3717.943271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Yeah. I guess. Yeah. | 3685.855146 | 3722.023271 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Because, | 3688.0151459999997 | 3688.095146 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, usually when it gets black, it's, like, fucking scorched to the | 3722.403271 | 3725.1233110000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | fucking. | 3725.1233110000003 | 3725.2832710000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, I | 3725.2832710000002 | 3726.403271 |
| SPEAKER_3 | see it's, like, a fucking | 3726.403271 | 3693.565146 |
| SPEAKER_4 | puddle still. Yeah. | 3728.333271 | 3729.293231 |
| SPEAKER_0 | That's not bad though. | 3729.293231 | 3730.633271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's still not that bad. But I've I've just seen it get a lot darker. Okay. So I want to play something. Physicist. Would | 3696.485106 | 3744.3733110000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you like to play a game? | 3744.3733110000003 | 3745.673271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Because this is a I guess this is the one of the starkest examples of like, exactly what I'm referring to whenever you deflect When I say that you deflect and it's like, | 3713.485106 | 3763.593271 |
| SPEAKER_4 | fun. | 3732.075146 | 3732.575146 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I thought we talked about the whole deflection thing. | 3739.535096 | 3779.323271 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. | 3779.323271 | 3779.483231 |

| SPEAKER_0 | before, | 3796.103271 | 3796.543271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that's what I'm trying to point out, but you don't, like, | 3762.715146 | 3799.323271 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I | 3765.9751459999998 | 3766.055146 |
| SPEAKER_1 | want to I don't necessarily know that I'm doing it at the time. On. And looking back at it, yeah, I fucking damn better than fucking Michael Claverley. But, like, yeah. And it's like in the moment, fucking I don't I don't necessarily know that I'm doing it, but it fucking | 3800.363271 | 3822.183271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. No. But, like, | 3790.145146 | 3825.583271 |

| SPEAKER_4 | fucking | 3828.683301 | 3829.083271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I mean, it's | 3829.163271 | 3829.723271 |
| SPEAKER_4 | it's | 3829.723271 | 3830.043271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | relation to, like, the accountability thing where, like, Like, something so simple I don't know. It's not and it's this is, like, literally the 2, | 3796.295146 | 3841.633271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, | 3841.693271 | 3841.843271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, it's like a 5 minute thing, but we don't even have to listen to all of it at all. I'm gonna say that's, like, the most it would be. | 3808.175146 | 3851.063271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm asking you to talk again. | 3850.2651459999997 | 3886.113241 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You said that you're going | 3853.995146 | 3889.493301 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to be gas | 3889.493301 | 3890.313271 |
| SPEAKER_0 | and then you said to me, You were walking away before you loosen shit up. So that meant that you invited me | 3856.405146 | 3900.103271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | How is that line to you? | 3865.9551460000002 | 3901.523271 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And it's not 2 different things, and it take 56 minutes to get gas? | 3868.385146 | 3905.993301 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I went to the gas station. I chilled the fuck out. | 3872.0151459999997 | 3908.733271 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. | 3874.585146 | 3875.085146 |
| SPEAKER_2 | You said | 3877.795146 | 3912.743301 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you | 3912.743301 | 3912.876601 |
| SPEAKER_1 | were going again. A good guess. I could | 3912.876601 | 3914.483271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But can you tell me, like, what if he's here what I hear? I mean, is it not I mean, I said that you lied to me because you left and just told me you were going to get gas, never anything else. So while you're gone for 56 minutes in this time where you just told me that part, and then you were gone for almost an hour. I asked you if it's that if that's how long it takes to get gas. You told me you were just chilling the fuck out, which meant that which meant you were just gone for that long, and then but you knew that you told me you were just going to get gas. So I don't see how it could be a, like, a thing where I was not I was not in my right to be, like, did you tell me you were just going to get gas? You didn't tell me anything else, and you've been gone for 56 minutes. So Like, you didn't just go get gas, but the fact that it was, like, such a stretch for a stretch for you to be, like, yeah. No. I I should have, like, yeah, I should have told you this, you know, this or that. Like but instead it was like a they're not how are they not this thing? I can do both things. Like, but that was what I was saying. Like, you didn't tell me you were going to do You told me you're gonna go get that. I'm sitting here, like, waiting for you. Then you get thinking the whole time you're gone, like because you were, like, in an argument or whatever, but, like, I don't know what you're doing at that moment. Whenever I know gas doesn't take that long to get, and you didn't tell me anything else. | 3882.1650959999997 | 4007.653271 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Casting is | 3974.615146 | 4009.563271 |
| SPEAKER_3 | full. But | 4009.563271 | 3976.595146 |
| SPEAKER_5 | that's not what you were doing. You said that you walked away before you blew some shit up. Is volume. You said you left. And why you're on. Right? | 4010.903271 | 4017.673171 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It can be both. | 4019.173171 | 4020.1632710000003 |
| SPEAKER_6 | But you're only Oh, no. This man, how the fuck it can't be | 3986.095146 | 4023.9932710000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | both. | 4023.9932710000003 | 4024.063271 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Because you only told me one part of it was that you were going to | 3993.005046 | 4030.903271 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Sorry if I didn't think So fucking tell you that I was fucking away from fucking | 4000.815146 | 4041.503271 |

| SPEAKER_2 | So put yourself in my shoes. I you immediately went into defense. By me saying by me having I had an issue with what you did. What you did was not cool. So for it to be sudden like, for it to be turned around on me as if I my feelings and me being upset was invalid and not right, like, the response I expected was something like, I'm sorry. I I should have told you that I needed a minute to calm down or whatever. You know? Just something like that. Like, it's like, I don't know. But instead it was like a like, explaining, like, trying to say that they were the same thing, and then basically me being upset about it was not valid is what that | 4023.9052460000003 | 4100.103371 |
| SPEAKER_3 | is | 4100.263371 | 4100.423271 |

| SPEAKER_7 | I didn't fucking knew. I don't even know why the fuck we got to this level in the first place. | 4190.125046 | 4195.275146 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Well, you went to go chill out. | 4230.3633709999995 | 4232.393371 |

| SPEAKER_1 | the | 4227.335145999999 | 4227.445146 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the hoops were jumping through to try and say that you were not mad even after you just told me that you were gone longer than you said or whatever because you were mad. You were chilling out. I don't understand it. Like, I don't understand why. I mean and then, also, like, you said you need to chill out, but then I mean, I mean, is is that not what you were communicating to me? Was that, like, by saying you were going to chill out that you were upset about something or whatever, you had something to think about. And the fact that you were there for so long saying saying that you were chilling out, I was thinking that meant that you were you had something that you were trying to, like, You know? I wanted to express like, I wanted to talk about it. That we could so I could understand what you mad about in this situation so that we could talk about it. You know? But you just were, like, insistent now after saying that you were chilling out, insistent that you weren't even mad. And I don't understand how Like, I don't understand what to do in that situation because I'm, like, literally trying to tell you you're you're going you're contradicting yourself and I don't know why. But then they get to you more upset to the point where it's just you throw your hands up and your head back and just, oh my god, dude. As if, like, | 4227.445146 | 4348.473271 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I am being crazy. | 4348.473271 | 4349.613271 |

I mean, I'm not asking you to like, explain yourself as if, like, not trying to I don't expect you to just explain yourself and, like, give me any kind of, | 4317.395046 | 4383.443271 |
| SPEAKER_4 | like, | 4383.443271 | 4383.8332709999995 |
| SPEAKER_2 | reason or justification or anything like that to explain yourself like that. Mean, I know and I know you know, that it's wrong and that it's not right and that it is confusing and it is it is like, it's frustrating, and it doesn't help anything, and you're just Refusing to take accountability for, like, You know? Like, when you're doing when you do that, you're deflecting But I I know you know it's not right and it's wrong. I just want you to tell me that you realize what I'm saying when I say that you do this so that we can work on figuring out how to make sure that this doesn't happen and that you acknowledge maybe what I'm pointing out that you are it or something. Right? Or is it am I wrong? About what I'm | 4350.9651460000005 | 4437.493271 |

| SPEAKER_5 | We got oh my god. Like, I'm just so fucking, like, I should be getting what you're saying, and I just can't get it. What do you think that means to me? | 4497.775046 | 4540.673271 |
| SPEAKER_7 | What do you think it means to | 4507.325146 | 4542.993271 |
| SPEAKER_4 | me? | 4542.993271 | 4543.3332709999995 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Why do you fucking own something? | 4522.735146 | 4558.823271 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Like, like, that was 3 times in a row. Every one of the responses you gave to what I said was you | 4539.605146 | 4580.048171 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I mean, but I want you to tell me, like, if I'm, like, not like, if I'm being if there's something I'm not seeing that I'm doing or that I'm being inconsistent about, I mean, I mean, I try to say what I mean when I'm upset, and I'm like, I don't know. But I don't tell you things that, like, I don't mean. | 4606.102838700001 | 4636.142839 |
| SPEAKER_1 | asshole. But that's generic in the. But I'm saying, like, things like But, like, just you will never, like, accept accountability, I guess. I don't know if that's the right word, but it's blaming it's blame shifting. For sure. Just it's never I mean, It's it just will never like, you never address, like, what I'm saying. I mean, a lot of times, I guess. A lot a lot of times in those situations, And you ignored the things you just like, just said. | 4601.774714 | 4687.592839000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | That there was something to like, I I don't know. I can't I can't I'm not inside your head, but I do know that, like, it's not it's not like a It's just a deduction. It's you know what? So you're not in him. And then it leads to, like, raging Like, that's what leads to, like, the raging, like, madness between us. most of the time, it's I fucking apologize, and that's not genuine whatsoever. And that's not telling me that you hear It's not like to me, accountability or just telling me that you understand me or that you Yeah. Is just being humble and being like, you know, being gentle about it and just saying, like, or I mean, one way anyways Just saying, like, okay, or something like that, and I'm sorry, or just tell you that you understand. What I'm saying the issue is most of the things that we fight about whenever we're fighting, though, is, like, literally the what? Don't know. I say the same thing a lot just that you don't care about what I my feelings or what I'm trying to say. You don't seek to understand me. From | 4722.209131 | 4773.701005999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And I just, like, almost forgot because that you by saying that, okay, yes, you admitted that you were but by saying that, you dismissed everything I was trying to address, which was the fact that you were not answering. You were that you of what you were doing. That was not cool at all because at that point, I was like, I don't want you to say it now. I knew you were mad the whole time. That's not the point I'm making. My point is that the fight that we got into was over the fact that you didn't want to just admit that you were upset about something. Oh, Actually, I don't remember. I think this might have been I don't know if this is the same night that we got up they we were upset with like, we were fighting already. Because of the same example about Daniel the Daniel thing. Or if this was I don't remember for sure, but if this is the thing about New Year's and going to, going to with his face is and me feeling like he didn't care to understand me, then But was a a what's this? Keith Keith? I don't even know. Sorry. I didn't think that now. I'm not like I don't want you to, like, answer to your behavior like that. I just want to know that you see what I'm saying or that or tell me where I'm missing something or where, like, I'm wrong or some I don't know. Or I | 4850.7428699 | 4940.62287 |
| SPEAKER_1 | know. We just got home so far. | 4940.62287 | 4942.79287 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But also, do you know how much you do this to me? | 4911.40475 | 4948.61288 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Since you got the recorder, kind of | 4916.074740999999 | 4953.37287 |
| SPEAKER_0 | That mean, it's | 4922.434749 | 4958.28287 |
| SPEAKER_2 | just because I feel like in order for us to get through it, I don't have to, like, it has to be ducking in it so that you can see. And then you can watch it. Make changes. You know? | 4924.2647449999995 | 4969.82287 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Mhmm. | 4935.914745 | 4936.414745 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm not trying to use this against you at all. Like, at all. I want it's a 6 I have I've I just have this little bit on this page, then I have all of this So Granted, this part is just more like the resolution ish But Okay. I'll finish this pitch that I think that we should, like, have some time for, like, | 4937.124745 | 5032.96287 |
| SPEAKER_0 | to digest in a way. | 5001.324745 | 5037.33287 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Against And think about, like, Right. I don't want you to beat yourself up about it at all. I don't Well, something you should do because it should be more about me. And how are you gonna do better for us. Doing | 5003.719745 | 5045.7247449999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that | 5080.03287 | 5080.11287 |
| SPEAKER_2 | doesn't help anything, but | 5080.11287 | 5081.49287 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that is a thought that's in my head. But at the same time, it fucking sucks having everything be your fucking call. | 5047.424745 | 5091.99287 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I mean, it's not like it's not the | 5060.544745 | 5097.21287 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I just laid on so fucking thick. Like, that's I'm not saying that that's your message or your intention but that's how I feel. | 5063.914745 | 5108.73287 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm not trying to do that. I know that that was what I was gonna isn't it all stems just from the same thing, though. | 5102.144745 | 5145.70287 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Just gonna buy it. It said it didn't matter, like, what it looked like after I all after I finished off all that silver, I wasn't doing it again. | 337.1702 | 382.6583249999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Is it now good? | 350.37019999999984 | 385.8183250000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. | 352.10019999999986 | 352.58010000000013 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Okay. It | 386.88822500000015 | 354.35019999999986 |
| SPEAKER_2 | looks | 388.6583249999999 | 389.1583249999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | it looks okay. Hi. It doesn't look perfect. I don't think but I think maybe just in a certain angle. I think it will be fine. Let's see. | 389.2183249999998 | 401.94832499999984 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I think maybe | 367.8000000000002 | 403.1683250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. Exactly. Why I'm just | 369.9402 | 405.94832499999984 |
| SPEAKER_4 | doing | 405.94832499999984 | 406.19832499999984 |
| SPEAKER_3 | it. I mean, granted it | 406.19832499999984 | 408.8635250000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | is | 408.8635250000002 | 409.038325 |
| SPEAKER_3 | a paint job of for a car. I think it should be done as right as possible, but Yeah. But my thing was I wasn't being lazy. Can't figure out the technique with what I have, and there's no fucking, like, way I would find people to explain how to do it with what I have. And then also, I've been a identify or talk about the exact problem I'm running into and how to fix it. | 374.73019999999997 | 438.59832499999993 |
| SPEAKER_1 | What exactly is the problem you're running into? | 404.53020000000015 | 441.19832499999984 |
| SPEAKER_3 | The issue with the, like, the shiny being the it being not as shiny in some spots only, because I'm telling you, it's not gonna it's not necessarily it has something to do with, like, | 407.0500000000002 | 451.82832499999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Is your paint not staying mixed up? | 419.05020000000013 | 455.3883249999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It has nothing. It's not that. Because if that were the case, it's being atomized when it's, like, exiting the airbrush. And also the fact it's not like that everywhere. | 421.6801999999998 | 463.4183250000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But if it's separating in the cup, or, like, the glitter's floating down to the bottom so that sinking down to the bottom | 429.1902 | 472.6683250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I know what you're saying, but, yes, I mix it up. I definitely mix it up before I pour it | 438.62019999999984 | 476.36822500000017 |
| SPEAKER_4 | in. | 476.36822500000017 | 476.42832499999986 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Every single time. Definitely. Definitely. But regardless, that one has changed | 442.12019999999984 | 480.63822500000015 |
| SPEAKER_1 | spraying it from when you pour it to when it's all all out? | 480.7183249999998 | 484.32332499999984 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. No. That's why that's why I have a glue on it and I shake it the whole time. That's why I was that's why I kept spilling it because I was used to having the lid on it. So I could shake it and make sure it wasn't separating. You know? But regardless, that still wouldn't change the color of | 450.3000000000002 | 497.44832499999984 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it. | 497.44832499999984 | 497.8183250000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Why would I change the color? The colors are still out of the gun. It's saying it's either if it separates, it's just color and then clear. You know? But the problem is I think that whenever it does spray sometimes, like, probably what you're saying in a way is that it gets separated. So some of it comes out like, dryer, so it creates a rougher Spot on like a spot, a rougher spot. A | 464.7901999999999 | 494.3901999999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | reference. | 528.6983249999998 | 529.1983249999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And | 529.6584250000001 | 529.8183250000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | then some of it comes out like smooth, And so I think I don't know. I I don't know for sure because I've also sanded it after a coat to make sure it was all uniformly smooth and then the same issue. Mhmm. But then so then I just did, like, then I tried it by doing, like, just 20 layers and not smoothing it so that maybe it just all got rough. And then that didn't really seem to help, but just seemed like some of these blocks got rougher. Then they still were a different color. And they still | 529.8183250000002 | 558.558125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | wear a different kind of | 558.558125 | 559.8682250000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | shiny. | 559.8682250000002 | 559.8983250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But also the fact that I'm using I it could also be the fact that I'm using I used matte medium and also gloss medium. That | 525.8301000000001 | 535.9402 |
| SPEAKER_1 | definitely | 570.248325 | 570.748325 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Well, hold on. | 570.9683249999998 | 571.9583250000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | It could matter, but I mix them both, and also | 537.8901999999998 | 575.3983250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | it could be the fact that it looks like that because of the matte medium, but and then it would be it would be fine when it's glossy. Is what I'm trying to say, I guess. | 542.2402000000002 | 584.6182250000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. If | 584.6182250000002 | 584.7783250000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you cover it if you cover it with gloss, it'll stay gloss. I'm covering it with metal, I'm saying that. | 584.7783250000002 | 589.2083250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. Of | 555.0601000000001 | 589.6883250000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | course. | 589.6883250000001 | 590.0083249999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I'm just this is just | 590.0083249999998 | 591.288325 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the medium for the acrylic water based paint, though. So whatever. That looks like if it's not, if I spray it with matte, it will be matte until I spray it with glossy it will be | 591.288325 | 601.078325 |
| SPEAKER_0 | shiny and glossy, and it will be fine. | 601.078325 | 603.3383250000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Whatever the last layer is is what's | 569.4501999999998 | 605.9183250000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. Of course. I'm assuming though maybe that's the issue with the consistency on the colors. No. That's old as fuck. | 606.2383249999998 | 612.6483250000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I that's all I was drinking soon. | 579.3000000000002 | 615.5481249999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Oh, I promise that. I I know. No. | 615.6081250000002 | 621.708525 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It does. | 602.8802000000001 | 638.5933249999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Wait. Wait. Where's my journal? Oh, yeah. I know. Where did my journal go? Right. I found it. | 609.3901999999998 | 649.0283250000002 |

And I guess that's not really a logical solution, but that's okay. Because I'll always wanna be here for you. So I'll be here for you. | 79.26999 | 148.968115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Fucking | 118.21999999999998 | 118.71999999999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | rocket launch. | 153.408115 | 154.058115 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I don't understand. Actually, not really an it was kinda cute, but I don't get it. | 122.50998 | 162.43811499999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Just me saying I love you. Well, | 128.91998999999998 | 131.47999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I knew that, but why | 132.22999 | 134.11998999999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is it | 168.56811500000003 | 168.728115 |
| SPEAKER_0 | today is not really your best | 168.808115 | 170.24812500000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | day. | 170.24812500000002 | 170.74812500000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know. It was I didn't break the words, babe. | 137.08999 | 174.218125 |
| SPEAKER_5 | But I'm just saying in general, why would anybody send that to anybody? As in, like, I've run like, | 140.58997999999997 | 146.56998999999996 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Oh, | 152.15999 | 152.31998999999996 |
| SPEAKER_0 | no. | 186.62811499999998 | 187.12811499999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You don't have to wash it. It's just That's what's so great. | 160.45999 | 205.12811499999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah, | 172.17998999999998 | 172.49998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I | 206.808105 | 206.88811500000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | guess. | 206.88811500000003 | 207.38811500000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's fucking horrible. | 176.60998999999998 | 212.218115 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I mean, it | 184.71997 | 219.83811500000002 |
| SPEAKER_5 | probably the thing would be funny by itself, but the caption makes it so horrible. Because I'm sure what they're talking about has nothing to do with that caption at all. But somebody saw that and was like, how can I make women and men hate each other more? Let me just take what they're saying, and it's funny, and make it like, women actually genuinely wanting men to communicate more. And then them and then them using this video clip which is funny by itself, and using it as the answer to that. As the response to that. No? | 185.76998999999995 | 249.618115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. | 217.68998999999997 | 218.18998999999997 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Wait. What? | 218.90999 | 254.038135 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Like, I | 254.418115 | 221.26000999999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't I don't see how that, | 255.56813499999998 | 259.678115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | like, | 259.678115 | 260.178115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it's driving a wedge between men and women Like | 226.52999 | 230.95000999999996 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Is that is that it's funny because basically, it's Okay. Is the concern of what like, somebody, like, of wanting you to communicate more valid or not? | 265.338115 | 277.088115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. It's valid. | 243.01998999999995 | 278.308115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Okay. | 278.608115 | 279.108115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But, like, it's like it's it's like showing how fucking dude talk to do talk to other dudes. | 245.39999 | 285.338155 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. | 285.338155 | 285.578145 |
| SPEAKER_5 | It's not. It basically saying that it's a can that they can communicate, that they just talk like that, basically. Saying that they're incapable of fulfilling that need. | 285.578145 | 293.458115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. | 259.46999 | 259.96999 |
| SPEAKER_5 | But you just said that. You | 260.71999 | 296.068135 |
| SPEAKER_1 | literally just said said it's | 296.068135 | 297.428115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | showing how | 297.428115 | 297.748115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | dudes have talk talk to dudes. Like | 297.748115 | 266.20995999999997 |
| SPEAKER_5 | And what does that have to do with men women then? And also, | 300.958085 | 303.618085 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, because it's not dudes saying that dude, we need to communicate more. It's saying that's usually, like, between a man and a woman saying we need to communicate better. Type thing. Like, What? | 270.93998999999997 | 285.51998999999995 |
| SPEAKER_3 | What | 319.82811499999997 | 319.988115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | is the point in the caption? Does it not say something about women? | 319.988115 | 323.528115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It says fucking Women, I wish men communicated more. | 290.36999 | 328.608115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | On | 294.95998999999995 | 295.11999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | how men communicate. | 329.428115 | 330.408115 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 296.93996999999996 | 297.25998999999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, by fucking basic | 331.648115 | 334.048115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | basically | 334.368085 | 334.688095 |
| SPEAKER_1 | say no. I don't wanna fucking communicate your feelings, like, to to between dudes. No. I don't wanna fucking communicate | 334.688095 | 343.728115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | the | 343.868115 | 344.188095 |
| SPEAKER_1 | feelings or whatever with another dude, | 344.188095 | 347.398115 |
| SPEAKER_3 | and | 347.858115 | 348.098115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | then they go on to fucking clowning on it. | 348.098115 | 351.348135 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Then it could just be something about, like, how dudes don't support each | 351.348135 | 354.388135 |
| SPEAKER_0 | other. | 354.388135 | 354.718115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Kind of thing. That should be the caption of it. Not having anything to do with a woman's actual bowel concern. What I'm saying is that that means that men are just incapable of communicating. | 320.48999 | 363.178115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I disagree. | 329.77999 | 364.988115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Oh, I | 365.688095 | 365.928115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | didn't ask you that when | 365.928115 | 366.408095 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you were coming | 366.408095 | 367.458115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | myself. | 333.70998999999995 | 334.20998999999995 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Really? | 336.06998999999996 | 336.42999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yes. | 336.66999 | 337.10999 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Tell me how that showed that men were able to communicate | 337.90997 | 375.198115 |
| SPEAKER_3 | then. | 375.498095 | 375.998095 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Didn't it just basically say men aren't capable of communicating? That that's what they do when they try to communicate? Is that not what it's saying? Is it? You're right? | 342.73999 | 398.218095 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Really? | 365.45998999999995 | 365.95998999999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. Like, | 400.648115 | 401.548115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I | 401.608115 | 402.108115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't understand what I'm supposed to say in that moment because if I say Because | 368.05996 | 405.248095 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I'm | 405.248095 | 405.32811499999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | asking you | 405.32811499999997 | 405.968095 |
| SPEAKER_4 | a question. If | 405.968095 | 406.368085 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I say | 406.368085 | 406.748115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | if I say you're right, then you fucking | 372.92001 | 409.278115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you | 375.68998999999997 | 375.76998999999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you you don't | 410.07811499999997 | 410.798115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | believe it. | 410.798115 | 411.428115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But if I continue arguing, we we continue arguing. So what do you want me to say? Because I agree with you. You changed my mind. | 377.51998999999995 | 420.038115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Well, you know, saying I'm not pissing me off more than anything. So maybe not say that? What do you mean? Then | 387.92999 | 394.32998999999995 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I'm | 428.63811499999997 | 428.798115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | not I'm not gonna be | 428.798115 | 429.438095 |
| SPEAKER_3 | right. | 429.438095 | 429.938095 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Then | 395.79001 | 395.98999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm That's the whole thing. It's the exact same | 430.298115 | 432.178115 |
| SPEAKER_0 | thing. | 432.178115 | 432.678115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | You disagreed with me literally like, one response previously, You disagreed with me. Okay? | 421.65999 | 464.128115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm sorry. I don't know how | 464.128115 | 464.992145 |
| SPEAKER_1 | responses should it take for me to change my mind? | 465.376145 | 467.428115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | If you let me finish what I was saying, I'm saying that you literally just with me. You had a lot to say when you disagree with | 434.94998999999996 | 476.628115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | me. | 476.628115 | 476.93811500000004 |
| SPEAKER_5 | So then suddenly, when you just agree with me, after not saying anything, I'm sorry if it's hard for me to take it as a genuine agree and not just wanting to not talk about it anymore. | 442.86999000000003 | 487.348115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The reason why I wasn't saying anything is because I was fucking thinking about it. | 456.50995 | 494.498115 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. You don't communicate these things with me. | 460.66999 | 497.578115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Why are you not communicating now with me? I mean, I don't know. I'm just saying you you have a lot to say | 463.82998999999995 | 504.338115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | when you were disagreeing with me. Maybe before even disagreeing with me, you could ask me to see to see my understanding or try and change my mind on it. So anything with a captain, Minh, colon women, colon, anything like that is divisive, period. It is divisive. That's what that that's the only purpose it it serves. It's to divide us. I mean, if it's I mean, something like that basically, where not showing your emotion to be able to | 504.338115 | 554.898115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. | 523.37999 | 525.76999 |
| SPEAKER_5 | What is b what is b by talking passionately about this doing to | 526.00999 | 563.768115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you? It's | 563.768115 | 530.53999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it rises passion in myself. Like, I makes me I respond, I speak louder. Now you | 531.01996 | 569.978165 |
| SPEAKER_5 | send it out. I'm not trying | 569.978165 | 571.018115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to fucking yell at you. I'm not trying to be yelled at. I'm asking please can we just speak to one another? That's all I'm asking. I don't know why the fuck that is so difficult | 571.018115 | 582.268085 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Because I am talking passionately about something, and if that's okay with you, I'm sorry. I I mean, I know it's okay with you. But I'm sorry. I care about this. | 550.3499899999999 | 592.738115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So if I speak passionately about something that I care about Yeah. I have a lot of y'all about it? | 558.58999 | 597.008115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And you're about to speak passionately about something, would you just scream at me? That's different. I never tell you You're not I never tell you to be quiet like you tell me all the time. What do you mean you always focus on how I'm like, my behavior. I mean, dude, all the time | 562.8599899999999 | 613.878115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you tell me that ask you politely please. | 613.938115 | 581.29999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And I am sorry. It is the way I'm communicating. I'm not yelling at you. I'm trying to express something I'm like, I care about. I | 616.068115 | 627.258115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | understand that you care about it, and | 627.258115 | 628.698075 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I understand that your | 628.698075 | 629.628115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | passionate about | 595.4799899999999 | 630.076115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it. So stop taking it, and so | 630.076115 | 631.468155 |
| SPEAKER_5 | stop being defensive about | 631.468155 | 632.428115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it. I'm allowed to be passionate about something. | 632.428115 | 635.448115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Maybe I just don't like being fucking yelled | 601.58999 | 637.698075 |
| SPEAKER_4 | at. I'm not | 637.698075 | 638.138075 |
| SPEAKER_2 | getting at you. That's what I'm saying. Now I am. | 638.138075 | 640.318075 |
| SPEAKER_0 | When something is trying to explain away why men are able to do that are harmful to themselves and it's okay, and excusing harmful behaviors such as not communicating, | 635.9699899999999 | 685.138075 |
| SPEAKER_5 | or not communicating with other men a genuine way at all because you're not supposed to do that or else you're, like, what a soy boy or whatever the fuck they | 652.83999 | 695.258075 |
| SPEAKER_4 | say. | 695.398115 | 695.498115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | That's harmful and not okay, and you should be able to do that. So using it as a way to be like, | 663.66999 | 704.788115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | oh, it's just how it boys will | 670.78499 | 706.998065 |
| SPEAKER_5 | be boys things. | 706.998065 | 707.978115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's it's | 674.03999 | 709.388115 |
| SPEAKER_0 | is a programming we need to, like, | 677.63999 | 713.948115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | unlearn. | 681.16003 | 681.66003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | It feeds into this narrative that | 687.90999 | 724.188115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Women are just nurturing and you know, they're good at communicating and caring about emotions stuff like that, but, like, but for them to never expect it in return | 691.08999 | 737.478115 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You can't expect it from men. | 705.13999 | 741.148115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I don't know why we teach to be like that anyways. I mean, I do know. If you're not able to be empathetic or, like, care about other people, then you literally | 718.67999 | 765.558115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | will not do anything but care about only yourself. | 731.61999 | 768.428115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | And you'll also just be destroyed | 735.07999 | 771.068115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | inside. | 771.068115 | 771.568115 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But if you can engage empathetically with others, a whole lot will change. | 742.73004 | 782.108115 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Again, I didn't I don't see anything wrong with the video clip. They were being, like, | 760.83999 | 800.598115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | they weren't it was not personal attacks. It was not, like, taking other | 766.8599899999999 | 770.64999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | down on things. Like, I I don't know. It was | 804.958115 | 806.828115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | It could be funny, whatever. Like, I saw that it's, like, harmless pretty much. I didn't understand everything you were saying, but But then whoever sees this clip and decides to put this caption when I am sure that is literally not the point in the conversation whatsoever in the game clip, And post it on Facebook and it gets shit loads of share reshares and whatever the fuck likes and rec I don't know what it's called. And Facebook just fucking, like, regurgitates regurgitates his brain rot over and over again. | 774.94999 | 844.488115 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I mean, that's how I sleep. | 828.18999 | 863.878115 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Makes sense. | 868.61999 | 903.748115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | My hands look bad. | 893.54999 | 929.718115 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Hi. | 899.53999 | 899.9699899999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Did they feel like they're swollen or anything? | 900.1299399999999 | 936.538115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. But I I guess I'm just, like, not Fucking skinny is like, like, used to be because, like, you should all see all my fucking like, basically, all my fucking bones in my | 903.2199899999999 | 950.768115 |
| SPEAKER_5 | hands. Well, how long ago was | 950.768115 | 952.168115 |
| SPEAKER_4 | that? | 952.168115 | 952.378115 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know. Last time I, like, looked at my hands like this. | 918.06999 | 955.278155 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Let me see. | 922.8000499999999 | 958.028115 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. Mhmm. | 0 | 1.1400299999999675 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I didn't know that it would make that big a difference. | 39.92003 | 76.40815500000002 |
| SPEAKER_0 | What? | 42.35001 | 42.85001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But there's a huge difference between the hammer drill and regular drill. As far as, like, its cutting ability. And | 77.45815499999998 | 83.37815499999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | which one is what? | 83.37815499999999 | 84.59813500000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The hammer drill. Has it does, like, the How impact how impact wrench works? Like, the fucking like, the guns. Mhmm. It has, like, a little fucking counterweight And whenever it meets enough resistance to stop, That counterweight is still spinning in | 51.19002999999998 | 102.89818500000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | the fucking Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You | 102.89818500000001 | 104.21815500000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | tell me this, I think. Well, that's what | 104.21815500000002 | 105.63815499999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a hammer drill has. So, like, whenever it's specifically for, like, masonry and shit, When you're whenever you're going through because most rocks are, like, somewhat porous or, like, there's gaps in them or | 71.65002999999996 | 115.78815500000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | whatever. | 115.78815500000002 | 116.28815500000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So when I like, it's cutting and then it hits a pocket of air, like a gap in the cut, It fucking it hits that next edge, It's not flush how it needs to be cutting or whatever. So, like, the blade will stop. But with the hammer drill, it has that fucking counterweight it is. So it's a blade little fucking get caught and then pow pow pow pow. | 82.51002999999997 | 138.28815500000002 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. | 104.22001 | 104.72001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It's continuously spinning. Fucking against | 139.32815499999998 | 108.76002999999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So what was the big difference though is what I'm saying? Like, how was | 143.14815500000003 | 145.78817500000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it Being able to cut ribbons like that? | 145.78817500000002 | 152.45815499999998 |

| SPEAKER_5 | I got this the correct cooling. I know that Yeah. Hold on. You come down. I | 332.80989999999997 | 386.63812499999995 |

| SPEAKER_0 | No. | 493.73 | 494.23 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Not really. I | 494.8599999999999 | 529.808125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | mean, I don't sleep that way. I think it you | 529.808125 | 500.03 |
| SPEAKER_4 | know, | 536.1581249999999 | 536.318125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | we haven't come to, like, an understanding of things. Of what went wrong when it went wrong, I feel like nothing is, like, changed as far as that goes. | 536.318125 | 548.348025 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, | 523.29 | 523.79 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Right. | 529.26 | 529.76 |
| SPEAKER_0 | 1st, | 530.1099999999999 | 530.6099999999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I'll | 533.4901 | 533.7301 |
| SPEAKER_1 | tell you why I wouldn't have this tuck. | 568.038225 | 569.9781250000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Because I love you, and neither one of us can fight like we have. It takes a toll on both of us. | 538.1400000000001 | 581.9781250000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | But | 553.22 | 553.3799999999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like, | 555.8599999999999 | 556.3599999999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I need to be sure that I can come to you. And that you'll listen to me and not dismiss the things I care about or things that my feelings in general that's one thing that is consistently not changed at all And it's not good. Me, really, but not you, Levi? I So it matters to me. Also, I figured I know it's just another day of the year, but I feel like maybe we should do this so that we cannot go | 557.7101 | 642.098125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | into the next year with the with these misunderstandings. So I mean, do you not think that there's anything that we need to talk about? Or did feel like we should | 642.098125 | 665.048125 |
| SPEAKER_5 | like, Both of us hearing each other out. And being patient with each other | 635.4200000000001 | 677.9082249999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | or, | 645.76 | 646 |
| SPEAKER_5 | like, chief on my list of 2 things that we definitely need to work on. | 680.308125 | 686.548125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But that doesn't ex that doesn't talk about, like, I mean, you're right. But I Like, when you tell me that I just love to fight kind of stuff. Or that, like, you think I'm just always angry. I mean is that what you really feel like? | 655.9200000000001 | 720.788125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | No. | 686.72 | 687.22 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But you say it. | 688.21 | 723.7181250000001 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I say it in times that we're fighting because in times that we're fighting, | 695.0799999999999 | 732.768125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But I don't say things like that that I don't mean. I mean, I say I call you names like I call you very generic general names, like which | 698.99 | 710.4701 |
| SPEAKER_0 | isn't okay. I'm not saying it's okay. But | 744.778225 | 713.6500000000001 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Very beautiful. | 729.4200000000001 | 764.548125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I know, like, name calling is not okay, but | 736.46 | 773.6681249999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I never tell you things like That that I don't mean that I know is not true, | 742.3299999999999 | 785.068125 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I say shit like that because of, like, the like, the premise that starts the fight It's like it's just a fucking simple misunderstanding | 755.9801 | 801.4980250000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | or | 769.4100000000001 | 769.44 |
| SPEAKER_5 | you know, just something like that Like, if I say something fucking stupid or whatever, and I'm not serious about it, but, like, you take me serious for it, and it starts a fight. Like, what the fuck are we even fucking fighting for? Like, I fucking didn't even mean what I said. So it's like, I don't understand why it gets fucking blown into this fucking knockdown drag out fight When I wasn't even serious when I said what I said. And I can't think of it specifically which fight I'm referring to, but I do know that that's happened at least once. And I was just I'm just like, wow. Why? What? Right. Sorry. That's why I said that. I we need to work on that. We still just work on each other out and then you know, being patient with each other because I'm still I'm still fucking at the beginning of fucking path as far as, like, like, seeing things, like, from your perspective or, like, the way you see them or Wait. And unlearning the shit that I've been fucking brainwashed with, So, like, I'm gonna say fucking stupid shit sometimes. I'm gonna fucking say that I think this way about something when it's, like, definitely not the right way to fucking think about it because that's where I am at present. And I know that I'm on the fucking journey, so, like, I I need you to, like, be patient with me in those moments and not like, immediately start, like, a what I feel is like, attacking me when it's Not you attacking me. It's you, like, addressing what the fuck I just said or whatever. But, like, it's I don't know. Maybe it's maybe it's my insecurity with what the fuck I'd like, knowing that I'm thinking maybe the fucking what I'm saying isn't the fucking right thing to say, touch Good. But, like, I say it because it's a response to the conversation. I I don't fucking know how to avoid what I'm saying, but | 769.6800000000001 | 949.098125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I I don't fucking know. | 916.55 | 953.9881250000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's okay, you know. They don't do that. | 920.9601 | 957.2081250000001 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I | 924.28 | 924.6199999999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I | 925.1299999999999 | 925.6299999999999 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Like, if I say some shit that I learned that I don't agree with and then I get taken for absolutely believing in what I just said. Like, | 930.01 | 942.03 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I | 945.31 | 945.81 |
| SPEAKER_5 | it's almost like a fucking almost like an insult to be taking, like, As I believe in that shit. You know what I mean? Because, like, if I if I say some shit that, I've learned that I disagree with, but it's what is in my head. But I disagree with it. And it's like, taken for like, I'm speaking gospel type shit. I'm just like, damn. Like, how fucking dumb Do you think I am? To fuck if you think that I actually believe this shit, But | 949.0399 | 987.6500000000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I understand why. | 1022.058125 | 1023.298125 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Like, I it's like I said, it's that's that one's on me for sure. | 1023.298125 | 1027.258125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Well, first of all, I don't think that you owe when you say things that are what you've been told. In fact, I think that that's The case a lot of the times | 996.47 | 1042.708025 |
| SPEAKER_0 | especially because it's always something where you say you heard from Zach. | 1008.8599999999999 | 1046.548125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And so, I mean and I already I already kind of figured that every time you say something like that. But I don't know how I'm supposed to respond if you know, like, I I guess, like, | 1013.3799999999999 | 1060.138225 |
| SPEAKER_0 | you say that you don't believe it, but then I | 1026.71 | 1062.778125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | don't understand why it's the response. You Give me I guess. | 1062.778125 | 1066.688125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Or or you could just say that, like, yeah. So and so told me this or I saw this you | 1033.18 | 1039.7 |
| SPEAKER_2 | know, this and let me know explicitly that is what you were told, but you don't believe it. Kind of thing. Because | 1074.008125 | 1047.67 |
| SPEAKER_0 | if you just say something out of your own, like, mouth and not saying it's somebody else's, like, like, idea, then what am I supposed to think other than | 1048.0499 | 1091.078125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that? It is what you | 1091.078125 | 1092.558125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | believe. But regardless of whether or | 1058.41 | 1094.398125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | not it is what | 1094.398125 | 1094.958125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you | 1094.958125 | 1095.1981250000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | believe because it's | 1095.1981250000001 | 1095.758125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the only thing you've heard. Is | 1095.758125 | 1065.0499 |
| SPEAKER_0 | is beside the point. I mean, I'm not mad at you. Anyways, But I'm just trying to explain to you, like, why what you said is wrong. Or at least give you a different perspective, and then | 1066.48 | 1112.668125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you to, like, I I mean, if it's not your ideas, then there's no need to be, like, offended and also, like, I understand that most of the time, and I'm not trying to, like, I'm just trying to get you to | 1078.46 | 1127.848125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | think critically about it. | 1127.848125 | 1129.258125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So you can come to a different understanding. But I don't think that you're stupid at all. I don't. But if you say something, that has that's not of sound reasoning or just like devoid of any critical thought. I'm gonna say it. I wanna tell you so that you can think about it critically and realize that, like, these are the things that we're told and we're told also to not even think about things. Not to think for ourselves. And we have to think for ourselves Well, I said | 1095.11 | 1169.148125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | We | 1137.5200000000002 | 1137.76 |
| SPEAKER_5 | do. | 1172.068125 | 1172.568125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Then in their cases, I don't know sometimes because you get like, I'm just trying to tell you that what you have said is wrong and trying to like, explain | 1142.9999999999998 | 1188.568125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | to you. Like, I understand that it's what you told us. It's only thing you've been told about this subject. Like, what else are you supposed to think or what else do you know? But the fact I'm bringing you a different perspective you can tell me what you've been told You could even ask me questions to debunk your own thoughts, | 1188.568125 | 1203.798125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I guess, like, you know, maybe or Good. Get you a better understanding or ask me questions and make me think about what I said. Maybe you think about my logic on things like | 1203.798125 | 1213.968125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | promise you, I would change my mind like that, like, It's | 1179.9799999999998 | 1183.78 |
| SPEAKER_2 | there is yeah. I mean, I have no problem changing my mind. I wasn't always like that. That's for sure. But I don't think that you're stupid. I never do. I I wouldn't be with you. | 1185.3 | 1235.048125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | But | 1205.11 | 1205.51 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I could, like, I'm writing down rules. I can move pen to work. What? | 1205.51 | 1218.4401999999998 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I just had a wonderful idea. | 1220.0798000000002 | 1256.1680250000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | What? | 1222.3398 | 1222.8398 |
| SPEAKER_5 | It's completely off topic. But | 1225.0600000000002 | 1228.1499999999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I could go grab the | 1230.01 | 1266.188125 |
| SPEAKER_5 | one of the rotors from outside That way, I can fucking mark the exact positioning of the holes that I need to drill. And see where the fucking, end of the axle comes through to where I have to cut that out. | 1232.5200000000002 | 1280.938125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And then voila. I have it. | 1247.0800000000002 | 1287.298125 |

| SPEAKER_3 | away. | 298.178125 | 298.428125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Ask a question to prompt reflection. How do you think we can create a space for both of our feelings are validated and addressed without it feeling like a fight? Weak defensiveness and avoidance of accountability | 264.76 | 309.15807499999994 |
| SPEAKER_3 | bring | 309.298095 | 309.538085 |
| SPEAKER_2 | up his defensiveness shuts down conversations and prevents resolution. When you respond to my concerns by saying I didn't do anything, feels like we're stuck in a loop where the issue doesn't get resolved. I | 309.538085 | 286.77 |
| SPEAKER_3 | need us | 321.078125 | 321.39812500000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to focus on understanding each other's perspectives instead of immediately defending ourselves. Request a change. What I need from you is to take a moment to listen when I express concern and acknowledge how your actions might have impacted me. Even if it wasn't your intention. Can we work on that? See, lack of engagement in resolving | 321.39812500000005 | 339.72808499999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | issue | 339.72808499999996 | 340.058125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | point out how his inaction affects the relationship. | 306.30999999999995 | 342.568125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | When I pour | 309.03999999999996 | 343.90812500000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | my heart into letters or try to talk through | 343.90812500000004 | 345.828125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | things, | 345.828125 | 346.188125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | and you don't engage with what I've said, It feels like my efforts don't matter. It leaves me feeling emotionally drained while you move on. Suggest actionable changes like us to have a follow-up conversation after I share something important where we both talk through what we've or discussed. Would you be open to that? | 311.88 | 363.698125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | See, | 330.27 | 330.35 |
| SPEAKER_2 | using excuses | 364.65812500000004 | 365.478125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | for an | 365.53812500000004 | 365.938125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | action addresses you so it doesn't have an overnight as a reason not to engage. I understand that change takes time, I've been patient because | 365.938125 | 374.62816499999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I | 374.62816499999997 | 374.78812500000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | believe in you, | 374.78812500000004 | 375.76812499999994 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Euna. | 375.828125 | 375.958125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But when it feels like no effort is being made, it's hard for me to feel | 342.2099999999999 | 380.03812500000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | hopeful. Can we talk | 380.03812500000004 | 381.92815499999995 |
| SPEAKER_2 | about small, meaningful steps we can take together to work on these things? 3, structure the | 381.92815499999995 | 387.328125 |

| SPEAKER_1 | deeply. | 393.02812500000005 | 393.328125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But love alone isn't enough. We need to work together to make sure our actions show that love. Step 2, discuss specific patterns used neutral, non language to describe recurring issues. I've noticed that when I try to bring up something that's bothering me, it often turns into a fight | 359.5 | 408.608125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | because | 408.608125 | 408.848125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | we're | 408.848125 | 409.098125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | focused | 409.098125 | 409.49812499999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | defending ourselves instead of understanding each other. I want | 375.42997 | 413.17815499999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to change | 413.17815499999995 | 413.818125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that. I also feel like we're stuck in a cycle where we apologize, but don't address the behavior that caused the hurt in the 1st | 413.818125 | 420.438125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | place. | 420.438125 | 420.728125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | This leaves the issue | 387.06003 | 422.588125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | unresolved | 422.968125 | 423.218125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | we end up fighting about the same things over and over. Step 3, invited perspective ask open ended questions to encourage him to reflect How do you feel when I bring up concerns? | 389.06999999999994 | 433.10808499999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Do you | 399.73996999999997 | 434.288085 |
| SPEAKER_2 | feel like I'm attacking you? What can I do to make these conversations feel less stressful for | 434.288085 | 439.578125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you? Do you think we're | 439.578125 | 441.248165 |
| SPEAKER_2 | addressing the root of our | 441.248165 | 442.368155 |
| SPEAKER_3 | issues | 442.368155 | 442.75812499999995 |
| SPEAKER_2 | do you feel like we're stuck in surface level arguments? Step 4, | 408.44999999999993 | 446.958125 |

| SPEAKER_2 | outline what you need from them moving forward. When I express a concern, I need you to listen without jumping to conclusions about what I mean or how I feel. | 448.798095 | 455.52812500000005 |
| SPEAKER_3 | If you're | 422.02 | 456.728125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | not sure, ask me questions instead of assuming. | 456.728125 | 459.068125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I need you to engage with the things I share, whether it's a letter or a conversation. That | 425.6 | 430.55999999999995 |

| SPEAKER_1 | you. | 467.50812499999995 | 467.88812499999995 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I need us to address the patterns of dismissing or avoiding accountability when something hurts either of | 433.98 | 473.228125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | us. | 473.228125 | 473.478125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Accountability isn't about blame. It's about growth. For plan for future conflicts, end the conversation by creating a plan for to handle disagreements moving forward. Let's agree to take a break if an argument escalates and come back to it when we're calm. When one of us expresses a concern, let's focus on listening and understanding in of defending ourselves right away. Let's prioritize discussing one issue at a time so we don't feel overwhelmed or frustrated. 5, follow-up after the conversation commit to checking in regularly to ensure You could suggest let's schedule time once a week to talk about how we're doing as a couple and address anything that might be bothering you. Before it becomes a bigger | 439.89 | 513.398125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | issue. | 513.398125 | 513.648125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Additional tips, stay calm. If he becomes defensive or dismissive, gently redirect the conversation without escalating. For example, I'm not trying to attack | 479.98 | 523.198125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you. | 523.198125 | 523.648125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Trying to share how I feel so we can work through it together. Set boundaries. He refuses to engage constructively, remind him of the ground rules or suggest take a break. | 489.5799999999999 | 533.2681249999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | This | 533.648125 | 533.968125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | conversation is important to me. It feels like we're not making progress right | 533.968125 | 537.678125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | now. | 537.678125 | 538.178125 |

| SPEAKER_3 | up? Feel free to ask me There's a step by step approach to help you structure the | 613.248125 | 625.568125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | conversation with your fiance so it remains productive, respectful, and goal oriented. The focus is on mutual understanding taking responsibility, establishing a plan for how to address issues in the future. Not on assigning blame. Power star 1, set the tone and ground rules. 1, agree on intentions. Express that both of you want a loving, respectful relationship, and that the goal of the conversation is to strengthen your bond, not to win an argument. Say something like, I want us to move forward feeling heard and respected, and I'm hoping we can figure out how to do that together. 2, define basic guidelines. No insults or name calling. Each person speaks without interruption. Both parties commit to listening and asking clarifying questions before disagreeing. 3. Emphasize calm engagement. If emotions rise too high, agree to take a short break and reconvene. For instance, if either of us feels overwhelmed, let's pause for 10 minutes and then come back when we've calmed | 591.5 | 689.228085 |
| SPEAKER_1 | down. | 689.228085 | 689.638125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 2. | 656.77 | 657.27 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Start with validation and common ground. 1, acknowledge | 692.438125 | 662.05 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the good. | 696.818175 | 697.748125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Even if things are tense, start by acknowledging something you appreciate about him or the relationship. This helps disarm defensiveness. I appreciate how you always help with x y z. Or I love that we both want this relationship to work. 2, explain why this matters to you. Clarify that you're doing this not to fight, but because you care. I'm bringing up these issues so we can be stronger together. Not to criticize you as a person. Not our 3. Address the core communication patterns. A, defensiveness and gaslighting. What to say. Sometimes when I bring up something that hurts me, you go into defense mode or tell me I'm crazy. For feeling that way. That makes me feel dismissed. I'd like us to focus on hearing each other without dismissing or deflecting. Ask for a commitment. Could you try to listen first? And ask me clarifying questions about why I feel a certain way rather than assuming I'm attacking you. B, dismissal of your emotions and beliefs. What to say? When I share something personal, like how I dislike being intentionally annoyed, You sometimes say it's no big deal, but it is a big deal to me. I need you to at least consider my feelings as valid. Ask for a commitment. If you disagree, can you still acknowledge my feelings and explore why I feel the way I do, instead of just telling me I'm over reacting or that it's nothing, c, avoiding accountability. What to say? I noticed that whenever we fight, you sometimes apologize initially, but later, you act like you never did. This makes me feel like the apology didn't mean anything. It's important to me that we both stand by our words. Ask for a commitment. Can we agree to own our apologies and not erase them later? If either of us feels misunderstood after an apology, we should talk it through rather than deny we ever apologized. 4, dive into specific contentious issues. A. Intentional annoyance, playful teasing. Explain the impact. When you do x, I feel y. It might be playful to you, but it hurts me or makes me feel disrespected. I want us to find a better way to joke around. Ask for willingness to understand. Could you ask me why it makes me feel that way so we can find a compromise that works for both of us? B, gender roles and mutual respect. Frame it constructively. I believe we both value a relationship where our voices are equally respected. When you do something like expecting me to laugh off teasing, it feels like my feelings are taken seriously. Ask for reflection. How do you see traditional or gendered expectations affecting our communication? Can we find common ground on how we interact so neither of us feels put down or c, his claims about your anger both belittling him. Reiterate your good intentions. Understand you feel I'm angry or belittling. I'm not trying to disrespect your experiences, especially about race or identity. I just want us to be able to question ideas without it turning Invite his perspective. Can you share an example of when you felt belittled? And let's see if there's a misunderstanding or a better way I could communicate next time. D, racial awareness and avoiding false consciousness. Set realistic expectations. I'm not asking you to change overnight, but I am asking for effort. If you say you understand that it takes time, great. But I need to see you actively thinking about these issues, not dismissing them. Give concrete steps. Suggest reading something together or discussing a documentary's essay. Ask him to approach you with questions instead of assuming he already knows your views or feeling forced to agree. 9, outline clear asks and actions. After presenting your concerns, be explicit about what you're hoping he will do going forward. 1, listen and inquire before disagreeing. When I say something bothers me, please ask me more about why it bothers me instead of deciding you already know. 2, take ownership of apologies. You apologize during a fight, please don't later say you never apologized or that you were never at fault. 3, engage with my letter's notes. When I pour my heart out in a letter, I want you to address at least 1 or 2 points in response. Like, actually respond to what I said so I know you've heard me. | 663.5999499999999 | 974.5681249999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 4, | 941.6999 | 942.1 |
| SPEAKER_4 | participate in a check-in. Maybe once a week, we do a short check-in. We each share one thing that went well and one thing we'd like to improve. That way, things don't build up into a fight. 6, ask him directly. What do you need from me? Show willingness to compromise. I don't want this to feel one-sided. Please tell me what you need. How can I make you feel heard, respected, and loved? Encourage specifics. | 976.408125 | 1003.658125 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Black friends. Now I want you to think about that. When you say many, you just told me what you meant. See, I know what many means. If you wanted to tell me that you had one black friend, which I might have believed, you would have said, a, Not many. If you wanted to tell me that you had 2 black friends, which I maybe You would have said a couple, not many. If you wanted to tell me you had 3 black friends, but now I really start to think You would have said a few. So when you said you have many, you just said you have 4 or more black friends each. Keep in mind the numbers. 100 and | 0 | 33.36 |
| SPEAKER_1 | there were only 35,000,000 black people to go around that year. Friends. But more importantly, even if every one of us was telling the truth, it wouldn't matter, would it? What does that mean that the color have to do with whether or not you might be free racially biased? See, we act like somehow that's a get out of jail free card. That we can't be racist, that we have racist, we can't have the logic of that. We have that makes no damn sense at all. Is there, like, no. And I doubted any of you would not. It is a race. That history. It is a few gonna get it back again, but if students be all know that social problems are the result of about social problems. We all know that. Right? Like, if I were going to give a talk about world hunger, I've sure you would all agree that I probably shouldn't do that because if I open my mouth and tell you that there are billions of children on this planet starving from lack of nutrition then I probably ought not to see it because if I see it, that's why they will starve. Past this idea that the more we talk about it, the worst it gets because there's no other problem about which we would say that. Conversation would do. And worse ways of addressing the issue of race and racism. And I wanna suggest to you that by and large, our problem stems, I we is that, for the most part, we steadfastly refuse to accept that we ourselves harbor racial bias. Now what had happened, but we can punish them. We can make the free money book. We | -11.848125000000003 | 277.95 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Information. That's all that a conversation about races. It can't be blamed for the problem of racism. The same is true with any other social problems. We have to the face. Now having said that, I don't wanna suggest that any about these issues doesn't mean that it's irrelevant how we talk about it. There are better and worse ways of addressing the issue of race and racism. | 0 | 37.260000000000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | issues or barriers to effective dialogue, things that keep us from having the kind of discussion that we really need to have. Maybe 4 if I have time, but 3 for sure. The first is that for the most part, we steadfastly In other words, we take this view that we have attained this pinnacle of color blindness that we do not see or think about race, that, yes, there may be other people out there who are racist, but not me. My uncle Jim, he's an asshole, but not me. I don't have any of that bias. I have, you know, I have black friends. I dated an Asian woman once. I have a dream catcher in my rear view mirror and now I have come to the conclusion that my great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess I can't possibly have any racism in me? That's somebody else's problem, not mine. So our inability to see ourselves as racially biased makes it very difficult to have an honest conversation because we spend so much time trying to divide ourselves into the good people who are not racist and the bad people who are racist that we miss the fact that we're all being programmed and conditioned in racist ways every day. So I'll have more to say about that in a second. But the second Problem. That keeps us from having real dialogue and making progress and taking action after the dialogue is that even when we are willing to acknowledge personal bias, we don't see the systemic problem. So we might be willing to attack the individual racist who does something on a college campus. We might be willing to to punish the women on the softball | 0.11187499999999462 | 130.10000000000002 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Police Relations Institute in Nashville, Tennessee. We are happy to welcome Tim Wise, Thank you. Thanks. Wow. This is crazy. Like, I didn't expect I was here 11 years ago, and I think we had, like, 11 people And they were only in the room because they had been forced as punishment to read my book, which is really awesome when you write a book and they give it as punishment because somebody did stupid racist shit. And that's what happened. It was like the women's softball team, there were some racist incident. They're like, oh, we know how we're gonna solve that. We're gonna make them read this book they don't wanna read. Amazing. And they brought me in, and I was supposed to talk to them If you ever write a book and have somebody assigned it as punishment, you know, you freely arrived. You're Ego will be taken down several notches as was mine. This, on the other hand, is fantastic because in order for all of you to be here as punishment, there would have to be some crazy amount of racist shit out on the campus, and I'm gonna really hope that that is not the case. And if it is, do not let me know. I need to get out of here relatively safely. Guess extra credit still counts for something though, which is not nice, right, to see. Because I know that when the crowds are this big, usually, there's some academic bribery involved. I'm cool with that. I don't really care why you came. Like, I don't care whether you're here because issues of racism or the stuff that gets you out of bed in the morning and it gets your blood pumping or whether you're here for the extra credit. Either way, you're here and I'm here and I keep the lights on very deliberately so that if you get up to leave, I will totally notice and call that shit out. So you might just wanna hang out It's just an hour of your life. You ain't gonna get it back again, but it won't be that painful. And it'll hopefully be informative. You're not under any obligation to agree with the things that I say. The only thing you have to do is listen and then and then having this conversation and continuing this dialogue with the folks on this campus who I have no doubt faculty, staff, administrators, and students have been wanting and desiring this | 0 | 166.71812500000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | and | 134.65 | 135.13000000000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | around issues of racial equity for a long time, and those folks are disproportionately people of color to whom we need to learn to listen and whose lead we need those of us called white to follow when it comes to creating racial equities. So on the one hand, I'm very glad to be here as, you know, a aspiring white ally to talk about these issues, but the real work and the real leader on this subject speak out about them every week yet who are often ignored. I hope that the next time there is a program on this campus in which not a white man, but a person of color is above you on this podium speaking that you will be here just as readily as you are this evening because | 135.68999999999997 | 217.768115 |

| SPEAKER_1 | and the way of false consciousness is used to reinforce these beliefs and behaviors as well as stereotypes Saturday, December 20, 2024 hashtag hashtag hashtag understanding microaggression internalized racism, and false consciousness microaggressions, internalized racism, and false consciousness are interconnected concepts that illustrate how social dynamics, particularly around race and identity, can manifest in subtle yet profoundly damaging ways. These phenomena are not only indicative of systemic discrimination, but also highlight the psychological impacts of societal norms and beliefs on marginalized groups. Hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag microaggressions define microaggressions refer to the everyday verbal and nonverbal flight in intent from the perpetrator. They can be directed toward individuals from marginalized groups and may be subtle, but detrimental in their cumulative effect. As described by the Cleveland Clinic, microaggressions can undermine an individual stereotypes. For instance, comments like, you speak English well for someone from your background Euro implicitly suggest that the recipient is not truly part of the dominant culture in validating their identity. These seemingly innocuous remarks can contribute to an environment of exclusion, causing emotional distress over time. A kid to death by a 1,000 cuts. Hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag the concept of internalized racism, internalized racism occurs when marginalized individuals adopt the beliefs and attitudes of the dominant culture regarding their own racial groups. This internalization of prejudice leads to an evaluation of 1 by identity and community. For example, individuals may feel shame about their heritage or believe that they must conform to dominant societal standards to be accepted. Scholars have documented how internalized racism can manifest through self hatred, denial of cultural identity, and the adoption of negative stereotypes about group. Internalized racism can have severe implications for mental health as it is associated with feelings of depression, low self esteem and anxiety. Hashtag, hashtag, hashtag, hashtag, hashtag, bulk consciousness and its role of false consciousness, a concept originally rooted in Mark theory, describes the state where oppressed groups hold distorted beliefs that obscure their understanding of their oppression. This phenomenon allows systemic inequalities to persist because those affected may internalize the values and ideologies of the ruling classes, leading to behaviors that reinforce their inferior status. In the context of race, false consciousness can lead individuals from marginalized communities to support and perpetuate stereotypes against their group. Believe believing that these stereotypes reflect reality. This is particularly insidious. As it not only cements existing social hierarchies, but also to discourages resistance against the various systems of oppression that undermine their identities. Hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag the cycle of reinforcement, the interplay between microaggressions internalized racism, and false consciousness creates a feedback loop that sustains systemic racism. Microaggressive statements often reinforce stereotypes that marginalized individuals may have in internalized, leading to further acceptance of their status as inferior within the sociocultural hierarchy. This cycle can perpetuate feelings of inadequacy and self doubt. As those affected might begin to believe that the biases directed toward them are justified. Subsequently, they may exhibit behaviors reflecting these in internalized biases, further perpetuating stereotypes within their own communities. Importantly, this cycle can also affect how marginalized individuals interact with others their group. For example, they may engage in defensive othering, distancing themselves from those who are perceived as embodying negative stereotypes. Thereby deepening intergroup divisions. Hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag conclusion understanding microaggressions internalized racism, and false consciousness reveals the complex ways which systemic racism operates at both societal and individual levels. Microaggressions, while often unintentional, serve to uphold damaging stereotypes that individuals from marginalized groups may may internalize, leading to detrimental effects on their self perception and mental health. Moreover, false consciousness allows these harmful beliefs to persist under my To challenge the cycle, is crucial to promote awareness and foster environments where diverse identities are celebrated and respected, enabling a collective resistance against oppressive structures. Recognizing the subtle but significant impacts of these concepts is essential for creating a more equitable society. | 2.8399999999999963 | 296.62812499999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Recognizing internalized racism, a path to awareness and change internalized racism is a phenomenon that affects individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic group. Leading them to adopt the negative beliefs and stereotypes that the dominant culture holds. This internalization often results in feelings of shame, confusion, and disconnection from one's cultural identity. Recognizing one's own internalized racism is an essential toward healing and promoting a healthier sense of self and community. This essay outlines several strategies individuals can use to identify internalized racism within themselves and begin the journey toward personal and communal transformation. Engaging in self reflection self reflection is a critical process for identifying internalized racism. Individuals should take time to examine their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors concerning race and identity. Questions to consider include, how do I perceive my own racial or ethnic group? Do I hold biases against my group or feel ashamed of my heritage? Reflecting on these questions can help reveal the internal conflicts and negative beliefs that may have been internalized over time. Self reflection can also involve journaling experiences and feelings associated with race. Capturing insights that may arise in everyday encounters or reflecting on family and community narratives about race. Seeking education and diverse perspectives, another effective way to recognize Educating oneself about the history of systemic racism cultural oppression, and the significance of one's racial identity can provide context for personal experiences. This educational process can include reading literature authored by individuals from one's cultural background, engaging with scholarly articles that analyze internalized racism, and consuming media that challenge dominant cultural narratives. Understanding the broader social context of racism can help individuals identify the specific instances of internalized racism they may exhibit. Furthermore, exposure to diverse perspectives can enrich one's understanding of their identity and the complexities associated with it, thus promoting a healthier self-concept. Understanding implicit bias and microaggressions individuals often unconsciously exhibit exhibit biases that reflect internalized racism. Recognizing these implicit biases may require individuals to reflect on their reactions to people of different races and their language use. For example, awareness of whether one feels more comfortable with certain racial groups or unconsciously makes assumptions about others based on appearances can illuminate internalized stereotypes. Engaging in activities such as implicit bias tests can help uncover these subconscious beliefs and highlight areas needing change. Additionally, it is important to recognize microaggressions, subtle, often remarks or behaviors that convey discrimination. Individuals can reflect on experiences where they may have either perpetrated or internalized microaggressions, resulting in shame or defensiveness about their own identity. By acknowledging these moments, can start to understand how deeply ingrained societal prejudices can infect personal Asking for feedback from trusted individuals, another practical approach to recognizing internalized racism is seeking feedback from close friends, family member, or trusted mentors. Engaging in honest, open discussions about race can provide invaluable insight insights into how one's attitudes and actions may reflect internalized racism. This external perspective allows for a more rounded view of one's behaviors and thoughts toward race and culture. It is essential to approach such conversations with Common examples of microaggressions that often go unrecognized and directed at marginalized | 341.47999999999996 | 605.1331250000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | groups. | 605.1331250000001 | 605.338125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | They may seem innocuous or trivial to the perpetrator or even bystanders. But they carry a weight that can accumulate and lead to significant distress for the recipient. Understanding these microaggressions is crucial for fostering a more environment. This essay explores some common examples that people might not readily recognize. Assumptions about intelligence. One prevalent form of microaggression involves making assumptions about someone's intelligence based on their race or ethnicity. For instance, comments like, you speak English so well, can imply that the person, likely a person of color, is not expected to be proficient in English, which echoes stereotypes about immigrants and their capabilities. Similarly, when people of color are told they are not like other, group. 340. The compliment that is in people may offer compliments that inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes or | 571.59 | 662.008155 |
| SPEAKER_0 | biases. | 662.008155 | 662.508155 |
| SPEAKER_1 | For example, saying you're pretty for a black girl or you're very articulate for a Latina may sound like praise, but it reinforces the idea that individuals of these backgrounds are generally not expected to meet those standards. 61 These comments not only objectify the individuals, but also imply that their racial identity has a negative connotation that can be offset only by their personal attributes. Tokenism Another frequent microaggression is which occurs when individuals of marginalized background are invited into discussions or settings primarily to meet diversity quotas. Expressions like you're so diverse, or I love how you bring a different perspective can be patronizing and may contribute to feeling of being used as a symbol rather than valued for genuine contribution. This trivialization can communicate to the individual that their identity is a mere accessory in a predominantly homogeneous environment. Questioning experiences, dismissing or questioning someone's lived experiences can also manifest as a microaggression. Phrases like I don't see color or that does they are their realities are exaggerated. This denial fails to recognize persistent issues of systemic racism and can leave the recipient feeling marginalized or isolated in their experiences. Stereotypical humor making jokes about someone's cultural background is another common yet unrecognized microaggression. Such comments may include asking a person of Asian | 629.0500000000001 | 749.408125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | descent to help with math using the phrase that's so gay as an in These jokes minimize and reinforce harmful stereotypes, allowing pervasive cultural biases to thrive thrive while the humor deflects genuine discussions about racism and inequality. Gendered assumptions individuals often experience microaggression related to gender as well. Statements like should smile more directed at women can discount their emotional states, suggesting that there were is tied to their appearance and demeanor. 8. Similarly, addressing women in professional settings with terms of endearment like sweet heart or honey undermines their professionalism and competence. Reducing their identity to gender based stereotypes. Invasion of personal space in many situations, particularly for women and large marginalized individuals, physical space is encroached upon without permission. Comments or behavior like touching someone without consent consent or man spreading where a man occupies more space than necessary, can signal a lack of respect for personal boundaries. These actions can send implicit messages about superiority and entitlement. Conclusion microaggressions can significantly impact the well-being of individuals, creating an environment of distrust and emotional among marginalized groups. Often unrecognized by those who perpetrate them these subtle slights can accumulate into a tangible burden for the recipient. Awareness is the first step toward change. Through education and acknowledgment of these behaviors, individuals can foster a more respectful, inclusive, and equitable environment for everyone. Recognizing the unintentional harm of microaggressions allows for the dismantling of stereotypes, ultimately paving the way for a more understanding and compassionate | 715.4200000000001 | 853.588125 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Us that that world of life is profoundly affected My social developments. That it is society and the language people established social relations and the attitudes they develop toward the natural world as a result of these social relations that will prove profoundly determine the future of the biosphere the ecosphere, call it whatever you like. Now this is a very provocative notion however simple it might seem. Because what it says is that the center, the locust, the target, the focus, use whatever words you want, of the environmental problems that we face today exist not only in our attitudes toward nature, but in the kind of society in which we live. Our attitudes toward nature, and I wanna use the word nature very provisionally, I mean the natural world. I mean that natural evolution. That that phenomenon, that we call that revolution of which we are products And that evolution can be traced, our evolution in the natural world can be clearly traced today. With an enormous amount of support of pale ontological material, or anthropo physical anthropology and the like that our evolution out of the natural world and we are still part of the natural world even as we evolved out of the natural world to form a social evolution. Has profoundly affected the natural world. And on Less. However importantly, we talk about the need to change our attitudes toward natural natural world. However, importantly, we think it is we seek to evolve a greater sense of of a a richer sensibility toward the world of life around us. The social relations, the economic relations, the marketplace have a more profound effect upon our relationship with the natural world than even our attitude Important as these attitudes make it. The very idea of dominating nation now let me stress the word idea here because I am consistent misunderstood about this. The very idea of dominating the natural world. I have argued in a very lengthy book stems from the domination of human by human. That with the breakup of crime old societies and to the extent that these societies were egalitarian, to the extent that these societies viewed at least their own members not those outside in most cases, but at least their own in various tribes as co equals To the extent that men regarded themselves as co equals with women, to the extent that elderly people regarded themselves as co equals with younger people. That the breakup of that sense of complementarity of co equality, leading to hierarchies in which the most striking that are known to us are patriarchy and more precisely papacy. Gerontocracies, the rule of the young by the old, by the way, the most widespread along with papacycentricity, the most widespread form of rule that existed long before economic classes emerged, These ages and the basic idea that certain individuals such as shamans, had mysterious powers of their own, not only over the natural world, but over human beings. Ultimately, reading for proofs and ultimately reading for deities with priestly cooperation supporting them. Conditioned our attitude toward the natural world. Nobody have thought that you could dominate the natural world without first bringing domination | 997.101144 | 1307.029269 |

That whole system of domination which people internalize which they make part of their psychic mechanisms accepting submission, and women have done that for 1,000 of years is no.

| SPEAKER_1 | Loving through consciousness, the impact of capitalism on our love in the labyrinth of modern relationships, capitalism wields a powerful influence that shapes our understanding of love and connection. As we navigate our bond together, it is essential to grapple with the external pressures imposed by a capitalist society. These forces often create barriers that obscure the authenticity of our feelings, urging us to evaluate our love through the lens of expectations. This letter seeks to explore how capitalism infiltrates our intimate lives. Leading to a distortion of what love truly means. The commodification of love love in our contemporary context is often viewed as a commodity. It becomes something to be acquired, traded, or even lost. Capitalist ideologies promote the notion that relationships offer a return on investment. Partners need to fulfill specific roles, emotional, sexual, and | 0 | 88.078125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | economic, | 88.078125 | 88.55812500000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and meet our ever growing expectations. This commodification creates pressure to demonstrate affection through material means rather than genuine emotional connection. We find ourselves caught in a web of societal expectations, seeking to impress each other with gifts and extravagant dates instead of simply cherishing the time we spend together. The illusion of scarcity capitalism cultivates an illusion of scarcity when it comes to love and potential partners. We are conditioned to believe that there are limited opportunities for lasting connections, which leads to a competitive mindset in our relationship The belief in finding the one amplifies this feeling of scarcity, making it seem as though true love is a rare commodity. Consequently, we may settle relationships that do not nurture our inner selves, driven by fear of being left behind in a capitalist society that romanticizes the idea of permanent partnerships. The impact of financial pressure, moreover, financial pressure exert a significant toll on relationships. Reports indicate that struggles surrounding finance With rising costs of living and economic precarity marking our existence, it becomes becomes challenging to maintain the emotional intimacy we desire while managing the practical aspects of life. The daily grind demands so much of our time and energy that it inevitably affects the quality bond. Us further apart even as we strive for closeness. Cultivating meaningful connections nonetheless amidst the | 88.55812500000002 | 178.338125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | looming influence of cow | 178.338125 | 179.628125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | capitalism, there remains a pathway to cultivate authentic love. Challenging the ingrained notions of commodification and scarcity. Can embrace a view of love that transcends transactional expectations. Real love flourishes in the depths of our shared experiences where vulnerability, communication, and empathy take precedence over materialism. Alain De Bottin Upland notes that love must be about mutual recognition and the will willingness to coexist with one another's imperfections rather than fulfilling unrealistic expectations that are often imposed by societal standards. A conscious love as we traverse our journey together I wish to remind us of the beauty lying in our connection that exists beyond societal pressure Love in all its messiness cannot be neatly packaged into a conventional capitalist framework. It requires courage to confront and dismantle these imposition yet it nurtures an environment where both of us can grow independent from the temporal needs fueled by capitalism. Together, let us cultivate a love that resists the pressure cherishing our shared moments free from the confines of outside expectations. Embracing love with consciousness turns our relationship into a sanctuary. Allowing it to thrive amid the noise of capitalism. This, dear one, is the foundation of our love, a place where we recognize love not as a product to possess. As an evolving journey that demands patience, understanding, and authenticity. Conclusion and closing, it is my hope that this reflects As we continue to nurture our bond, let us remain mindful of these external pressures. By choosing consciousness and authenticity in our love, can create a resilient partnership that honors our individual selves while celebrating our shared journey. Love is a beautiful struggle, one that flourishes beyond the material. I cherish every moment of it with you. | 145.96002 | 298.408125 |

| SPEAKER_3 | concept suggests that the systemic oppression faced by these groups leads to an internalization of inferiority. Shaping their beliefs, actions, and interactions within society. From a leftist perspective, internalized racism becomes tightly inter intertwined with the notion of false consciousness. Which refers to a misrecognition of one's real social conditions and interests due to dominant ideological forces. This essay will explore the connection between internalized racism and false con demonstrating how systemic racial oppression fosters a cycle of self devaluation and collective disempowerment. Defining internalized racism and its mechanisms, internalized racism can be defined as the process by which racially subordinated individual accept the beliefs, values, and norms propagated by the dominant racial group. Leading to a devaluation of their own identities and cultures. This phenomenon is not merely a result of personal failures or individual choice It operates within a broader context of systemic oppression. For instance, the internalization of negative stereotypes results in individuals reject their racial identity, aging behaviors such as skin whitening, or adopting Eurocentric beauty standards. According to sociologist Karen d a Pike, According to sociologist Karen DeeDee Pike, This internalization reflects both conscious and unconscious acceptance of a racial hierarchy. Wherein individuals perceive the dominant culture as superior and adopt its values at the expense of their own cultural heritage. False consciousness, A leftist framework. The concept of false consciousness stems from Marxist theory. Whereby members of the oppressed classes misinterpret their interests due to the ideological dominance of the ruling class. This misrecognition leads individuals to internal the values that uphold their subordination. Resulting in a systematic misrepresentation of their true social conditions. Consequently, false consciousness contributes to the continued existence of inequalities. As individuals do not recognize the mechanisms of their oppression. Believing instead that they have agency within a system that is fundamentally designed designed to disadvantage them. In the context of internalized racism, false consciousness becomes particularly relevant as individuals from marginalized often fail in their collective oppression. They may adhere to the belief that their social and economic struggles stem from personal failures rather than systemic issues. This idea blindness prevents them from recognizing the shared nature of their experiences and the need for structural change. As noted by cultural theorists, such misrecognition perpetuates a cycle. When individuals internalize racist ideologies, they not only harm themselves, but also contribute to the fabric that maintains these oppressive structures. The interplay between unconscious bias and structural oppression internally The mechanisms of racism operate through both interpersonal and systemic channels. In many instances, individuals develop a sense of shame regarding their race identities. Which can manifest in behaviors reflecting self hatred, This shame is fostered by societal narratives that position whiteness as the standard. Creating a cognitive dissonance for those who identify with a marginalized racial or ethnic From a leftist viewpoint, these internal conflicts highlight how capitalism and systemic racism work together to reinforce false consciousness. | 347.738125 | 615.4881250000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Structures that marginalize them. Implications for collective action and social change underscores the importance of collective action among marginalized groups. Efforts to combat internalized racism can facilitate a broad understanding of systemic oppression, motivating individuals to challenge the status quo. For example, cultural movements that celebrate racial identity and challenge the societal imposition of inferiority have been effective in fostering resilience and empowerment within communities unlearn | 634.424406 | 634.786281 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the internalized beliefs that perpetuate their oppression is essential. By collectively exploring shared experiences of racism, individuals can break free from false consciousness and begin to understand their positions within a broader socioeconomic and political context. | 634.786281 | 684.764406 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And confronting false consciousness are essential steps toward not only individual healing, but also achieving collective liberation and transformative the sociopolitical landscape, to challenge ingrained systems of discrimination, | 727.0004779999999 | 738.800478 |

| SPEAKER_1 | intervened with anybody else's bullshit. | 376.998712 | 414.666837 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But that's the thing. Is it? Intervening with other people's bullshit is not natural. Like, it's not the way that we should live what should want to live. | 380.968722 | 424.436837 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So, like, if I saw somebody, like, Like somebody like a dude assaulting a chick in the street. | 390.47871200000003 | 432.826837 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But that wouldn't happen because patriarchy is part of this system of dominance. Nation. I | 432.826837 | 404.148712 |
| SPEAKER_1 | mean, I'm | 438.456837 | 438.85683700000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | just That's the only reason why that wouldn't even be a thing. The fact that, like, men feel like, this power this the power dynamic to go and do anything to a woman is because of a power is because of a power dynamic. You know. Mhmm. Obviously, it wouldn't be, like, something that, like, would make sense, like, overnight at all by any means. So it's like, of, yeah. | 438.85683700000004 | 463.386837 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. Like, a a better example, like, if somebody somebody a lot bigger than the person that they're beating up was beating up somebody a | 429.638712 | 472.163987 |
| SPEAKER_2 | lot smaller than them. Why would they be beating each other up, | 472.163987 | 473.46683700000006 |
| SPEAKER_0 | though? | 473.46683700000006 | 473.886837 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But that's also a power dynamic. But why would they | 440.458712 | 476.506837 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But, like, Lay. That's that's, like, an ideal, like, society type thing. Like but, like, I think that there there | 476.60683700000004 | 487.136837 |
| SPEAKER_3 | are there are people | 487.136837 | 487.73683700000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that are gonna go against Nobody. | 487.73683700000004 | 456.188712 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What today, why what reasons do people beat other people up for? | 456.188712 | 494.59683700000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Fucking things that they consider property. Okay. Like | 462.048712 | 500.72683700000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So yeah. Property for | 501.12682700000005 | 503.26682700000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the relationship or looking material. | 469.328712 | 506.296827 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Keeping things for yourself. It's all for you. It's all individualist. Type of thinking. It's all about the individual and stuff. Mhmm. That's domination also. But, yeah, But in in if we didn't have this, like, individualist mindset where we just care about ourselves then there would be no beating people up over property. Everybody would have what they need. That's the idea. Not more than they need, and it's not even about once. Once, I don't even know like, I don't I don't know. Can't really I don't know what to say about once. But needs, as far as needs, meaning a place a home. | 472.298712 | 551.0968270000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I | 551.156827 | 551.3168370000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | mean, if everybody had their needs met, their wants would be far like, lesser. | 551.3168370000001 | 556.006837 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Exactly. The only and most of our wants are only for things such as status, or power or, you know, just like | 556.0668370000001 | 564.346837 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Should that doesn't actually mean anything. | 530.198712 | 566.606837 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Exactly. And that like these things these wants are superficial. Mhmm. | 566.666837 | 538.088692 |
| SPEAKER_1 | We | 572.396817 | 572.556817 |
| SPEAKER_2 | only want them because it puts us higher up than others. | 572.556817 | 576.926837 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. We have bounds. It's not | 613.4626289500001 | 615.4026292000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a lot of you, | 615.4026292000001 | 616.0026292 |

| SPEAKER_0 | But | 625.94263 | 626.182629 |
| SPEAKER_1 | We | 626.342629 | 626.582629 |
| SPEAKER_0 | already don't have, like, a lot. So, and we don't want it. So well, we don't want it for obvious So these I mean, Whatever. So then we're able to we are more able to Have to love without those bounds than other people with more. | 626.582629 | 646.2326290000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | does squarely. Does | 612.884504 | 648.552629 |
| SPEAKER_0 | that really? That's smoke. | 648.552629 | 654.472627 |

| SPEAKER_1 | cooperative, then anarchism is the only way humanity can thrive. And the way we did thrive a quarter of a 1000000 Until domination began, the human flock ran free. So freedom's just another name for anarchism. But how would anarchism work? Don't ask me. The idea that some people could tell others how to live is the opposite of anarchism. For 6 1000 years, more and more, the world has lived under domination communities everywhere have adapted from domination, people would create ways of living the | 215.26997999999998 | 308.14810500000004 |

And if that Since no one We don't know whether In other Evolution is an experimental question. Learning from our mistakes, and trying again. They got a random process. I hope you noticed that I've never been Institutions that The domination is obviously We can reorganize government As we struggle for you for your disarmament to protect the habitat, we can throttle corporate power.

| SPEAKER_4 | For another example, | 234.85812499999997 | 235.91812500000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | take away boxing, you know, physical sports like that. What about, like, powerlifting, weightlifting, things like that that men are just naturally better at because they're getting more testosterone. Yep. | 201.73000000000002 | 210.09000000000003 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Well, I mean, either way, there's really that men wouldn't have separate It's themselves. | 231.47996 | 243.78999999999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | In, However, based on 57 2 plus years of, hormone treatment. Would not | 243.80999999999995 | 292.50812499999995 |
| SPEAKER_4 | like, a | 259.0799999999999 | 293.968125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like an impact sequentially level. That's why it's short. Arena. Most sporting places do have requirements. I think that if you're competing in high school, I don't bear I don't need a requirement. | 259.73 | 305.76812500000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | School should be a purple thing as well. Like, I think we shouldn't have sports style. It's all been kind of a different scholarship for sports. I mean, I think | 272.35 | 313.198125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | sports should be totally High School. And then when you're out of high school, college, I think, is fine to have requirements. To professional sports is fine. Our requirements. It's a nuanced conversation. So I think we should have requirements based on the software levels and things like that. But I also think all sports in general should be that way. I think all sports should be Oh, wait. It's just based on, | 313.198125 | 333.49812499999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the | 334.45806500000003 | 334.95806500000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | different biological metrics | 302.11 | 337.558125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Okay. | 304.56999999999994 | 305.06999999999994 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I I I mean, I I disagree with, I think, I mean, if you there's no woman on the face of the earth that could play in the NFL. I mean, other than, like, maybe a kicker, but we've seen the women try to kick in the NFL and college | 340.078125 | 356.03812500000004 |
| SPEAKER_4 | and | 356.03812500000004 | 356.28812500000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it's just it it just doesn't work. I I would never be there. Claim there is no woman to to compete the NFL. I think that's a claim that's impossible to | 322.22 | 364.198125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | sustain. He's done violence | 330.92999999999995 | 366.858125 |

| SPEAKER_1 | in his victory, saying that he will be going after other members And costs a lot of money to do it. But we have to straighten out the press. Our press is very corrupt.

| SPEAKER_4 | Because I've | 290.36000204086304 | 290.84000204086306 |
| SPEAKER_3 | had to see what's describing them. I'm just saying, like, I got the gist was that, like, this person | 290.8400020599365 | 296.0500020599365 |
| SPEAKER_4 | is | 296.0500020980835 | 296.0900020980835 |
| SPEAKER_3 | a cry. Person or, you know, had some sort of, like, I just assumed that's what she's talking about because you weren't you were talking about them being a good person. If you're supposed to be in a positive | 296.0900020599365 | 305.9266520599365 |
| SPEAKER_1 | in a way positive. And that is even though we don't really have a way to fight back per se yet. And so I told you all, you know, rest up now, follow what's going on, but give yourself space to breathe. It's okay to tune out. You can catch up on all you need by reading the weekly list, listening to the podcast, the podcast, the the big thing for the big thing. Of our just current and and former law enforcement a, announce he would resign before Trump took office. The reason this matters, and it is atypical, Is this particular office is supposed to be apolitical. It's a 10 year appointment. Trump is the one that actually appointed Ray. And Biden left him in place. Because they're supposed to term serve a 10 year appointment regardless of who is president. Current and former law enforcement officials called the resignation unwelcome and worrisome and an ominous sign. Richard Blumenthal, who's a Democrat, called it a, quote, threat to the independence and integrity of our justice department. Trump also is continuing to close rail nutshots into cabinet positions. He is facing put back pushback as we've discussed. But also on the theme of media, he picked Carrie Lake, an election denier | 306.20887207984924 | 345.94187707984923 |
| SPEAKER_1 | said it. | 349.54189705848694 | 384.43000205848693 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Trump has long sought to strip the agency of its independence during his 1st regime. And Lake said the mission now would be chronicling America achievement worldwide, which is not the actual mission. A | 361.5519070625305 | 373.74187706253053 |
| SPEAKER_4 | in | 380.25000190734863 | 380.29000190734865 |

| SPEAKER_1 | of America. | 392.3000020980835 | 392.7000020980835 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. She's a cuckoo. | 392.70000195503235 | 393.62000195503236 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's a | 397.97185707092285 | 432.68000207092285 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Mhmm. | 401.92187690734863 | 402.42187690734863 |
| SPEAKER_3 | voice of a but | 408.0500020980835 | 409.33000209808347 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that was another note worthy | 409.33000206947327 | 411.1000220694733 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But does it about shit. See, I There's also a part of my house where, like, the | 411.18000197410583 | 414.3300019741058 |
| SPEAKER_4 | of | 414.9699819087982 | 415.2900019087982 |
| SPEAKER_1 | interest | 415.29000210762024 | 415.6899821076202 |
| SPEAKER_4 | in | 415.68998193740845 | 415.77000193740844 |
| SPEAKER_1 | this | 415.77000188827515 | 416.27000188827515 |
| SPEAKER_2 | week's | 416.57000207901 | 416.82000207901 |
| SPEAKER_1 | list. You can catch up by reading it all. But I wanna close off on a pause That is | 416.82000207901 | 424.33000207901 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I can tell she's she. No. She's very Like, what Voice of America is bad. | 424.4900019168854 | 431.6600019168854 |
| SPEAKER_3 | bad agency anyways, like, this spreading propaganda. | 432.68000197410583 | 435.5800019741058 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And | 436.8700020313263 | 436.9500020313263 |
| SPEAKER_3 | whatever. So for her to be, like, just saying like, oh, this is gonna be you know, that's not what the mission of Voice of America is, and then just, like, it's like I mean, I don't know. I feel like it's like a that's the wrong argument. Okay? The argument should be this is a propaganda freaking agency that just fucking, like, does harm or whatever. Like, it just needs to go instead of we need the right person in charge of our propaganda machine. Like rice? Uh-huh. But | 436.95000195503235 | 444.92187695503236 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 445.951877117157 | 446.451877117157 |
| SPEAKER_2 | just based on the fact that she didn't suggest, like, ending that fucking deal Mhmm. That it's gonna be it's gonna exist regardless. | 447.8318769931793 | 491.2900019931793 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I didn't think it was gonna get written, but what do you mean? They're like I know I know they're not gonna get rid of it. That's what I said. You can't, like, expect them to do something that benefits them. Or do something, that would change what something that benefits them. | 459.5118770599365 | 507.17000205993645 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So if they're not gonna get rid of it, wouldn't the best option be to have somebody that's Not 2 feet away from you? | 473.50187706947327 | 516.9300020694733 |
| SPEAKER_4 | imagine | 480.9800019264221 | 481.4800019264221 |
| SPEAKER_3 | My point was that the wrong argument isn't I was saying | 484.1318271160126 | 522.6000021160127 |
| SPEAKER_0 | never mind. I don't know. I guess it doesn't | 488.9318768978119 | 525.2599618978119 |
| SPEAKER_3 | The fact that she didn't say anything about it being bad means that she doesn't necessarily think it's bad. She just wants to write wants to not hook up person running it. I'm saying most people, if they when they hear this voice of America, they don't understand, like, what it is and what it does. So just leaving that out. I'm talking about talking about, like, well, he said he was gonna make it, like, spread the spread the the American whatever bullshit that that's what Trump said he's it already does. So it was just it's it's as if, like, when the when certain people do it, it's okay. Even though, like, I | 491.82187700271606 | 567.3600020027161 |
| SPEAKER_3 | She's naive. And also, she benefits from the system the way that she has lots of money. I don't know exactly who she is, like, but she's some prominent person in way. I mean, she's an advocate. I mean, like I said, I take everything with a grain of salt. There's very few | 536.9318768978119 | 591.8300018978119 |
| SPEAKER_3 | who I think are kinda, like, unquestion not unquestionable, but haven't given me any reason to doubt them. As far as people that we've listened to for anything or that I listen to. Like, | 558.7518770694733 | 573.5418770694732 |
| SPEAKER_4 | don't know. | 567.82000207901 | 568.22000207901 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I mean, I | 576.5018770694733 | 611.7700020694732 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Oh, so | 621.7118771076202 | 656.6000021076203 |

Just violence on a mass level or whatever, I guess. But also even still, no. I think no. I don't I don't agree with you, like, at all. Like, as far as world peace goes, you go being impossible. So you're saying that there will always be wars of against an amongst nations and states and stuff? Conflict. I was that's what I'm asking you. I just asked you. I'm I'm just | 2635.258460998535 | 2707.9965829985354 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm I'm talking | 2638.556582927704 | 2639.736581927704 |
| SPEAKER_0 | about, | 2639.8365828990936 | 2639.9165828990936 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, real is | 2639.9165830612183 | 2641.0465830612184 |
| SPEAKER_0 | What makes you say that? What is okay. Well, what is peace then? I guess. Maybe maybe that's You sound a little worried. | 2644.0265820026398 | 2649.7965830026396 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. So that's the s in links, nations, and states. Right? I'm not saying I'm not just talking about individual, like, issues. I don't even think I almost don't even think that that's a thing where there will be there will still be suffering no matter what, because because that's how that's the nature of just, like, living. There will be suffering, and You know? Nothing you can do about that. But that's not necessarily not peace, I guess. It's just Yeah. But for sure, no. I disagree totally that there cannot be no that there can be no world peace. Truly, I disagree. Because the only reason why there's not now is because of The like, a system that has to withhold or uphold or whatever. By being I mean, that's the only reason why violence is the same now. | 2687.7584578990936 | 2772.636582899094 |

Regardless, I mean, so he's 67. He's perfectly, like, he knows exactly what he's saying and doing. He's not just an innocent old man, like really old man, veteran guy, whatever I mean. Like, looking at some black guy who's just being obnoxious crazy, and drawing all his attention to himself. He even said that that was abrasive as fuck. I've been | 11.701874999999994 | 102.519996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, this is | 102.519996 | 103.25 |
| SPEAKER_0 | thing where black people just love to draw attention to themselves. | 69.101875 | 106 |

| SPEAKER_3 | you will you will you actually listen to me? Will you actually listen to me? I give my commentary on that? Because I have been around a lot of fucking black people I have. And In certain different situations, A lot of the times, they are they have been belligerently loud and obnoxious. Beg when? Like, watching a fucking basketball game or a fucking | 114.75999 | 146.76 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Is this just a black people thing? Just black people | 113.331865 | 149.27999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. It's not just a black people thing. | 149.38 | 151.06 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Right. But then why? What do you mean? Do you mean it's just a people thing? Some people do this? | 116.75187500000001 | 156.17 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. Some people do this. | 122.66188500000001 | 158.89 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. | 125.46188499999998 | 125.87187499999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | There's only black and black people do it or what? | 126.99187499999998 | 163.54 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. In my experience, it has happened I've seen Yeah. It's b black people that that do that More than Others, my personal experience. | 163.54 | 177.67999999999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Maybe you just don't like when black people do | 177.67999999999998 | 179.35999999999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | it. | 179.35999999999999 | 179.59 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Oh, no. I'm just why why do you why do you say shit like that? We're not yelling at each other anymore. I'm not yelling anymore. I'm I'm not yelling. Please don't yell at me. | 145.761875 | 193.76 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Because I want you just to admit you are I don't know why you like are trying to like like, first of all, you're changing the subject. Already anyways. Why are you talking about like, why are you focused on this part right now? I just showed you the video. You don't have anything to say about that? Like, how how you fucking miss like, how you told me this story about something that didn't happen that way? | 159.61187499999997 | 218.66 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Okay. I haven't watched the video in a long time. I remember it Why do you remember it | 184.511875 | 223.05999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that way? | 223.05999 | 223.6 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I I can't I can't answer that. | 189.451875 | 226.22999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I know why. | 226.22999 | 227.13 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Why? | 193.571875 | 194.071875 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Because it is racism that makes us think this way. I said us. People, I I It doesn't matter if you're black. You can definitely be racist against black people being black. We're all taught the same thing. We're all taught the same, like, bullshit about just black people being bad. We're all taught it. And, yeah, internalizing it is a thing that happens when that's all you hear. I am I'm I have this same vibe with you over and over again. Again, and I'm tired of having it. I don't wanna have it. I don't even wanna fight with you about it, but you One of the it just always started to me calling you saying I'm calling you a racist and I'm not. | 195.54187499999998 | 285.82 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I am a victim of the things that I have been taught. The things that have been fucking placed in my fucking brain are still there. I apologize. I'm trying I'm trying. To fucking change that. I | 268.221875 | 286.151875 |
| SPEAKER_2 | am. But why are we fighting about it? I don't understand why it's so hard for you to just be like, I didn't think of it like that or what I don't even know. Like, I am not trying to make us against each other or put us against each other at all. I'm trying to just tell you something that you I that is bad for you to think. Don't understand what is wrong with me doing that. Do you think you you're saying you let me out of it. You've been taught these things. I | 320.46000000000004 | 343.17 |
| SPEAKER_3 | just said What what you're what you're trying to convey it's it's not bad. It's not inherently bad. It I don't even really truly disagree with it. But the way the way it comes out when we when we start fighting about it that's my that's what I object to. | 343.17 | 365.14000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But why do we start fighting about it, Brian? | 365.14000000000004 | 367.24 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Because I'll say some shit that fucking exemplifies the fucking brainwashing that has occurred in my entire fucking life that you have already fucking surpassed that I still am a victim of, and you talked to me, like, I'm fucking, like, incapable of getting past this shit. Like, I refuse to even try to get past this shit. Wait. When you fight me on it, of course that's | 333.631875 | 396.56 |
| SPEAKER_0 | what you're doing, | 396.56 | 397.36 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Brian. No. It's it's Why do you fight | 397.36 | 399.82 |
| SPEAKER_3 | me | 399.82 | 400.06 |
| SPEAKER_2 | on it? I'm not fighting with you to be | 400.06 | 401.77000000000004 |
| SPEAKER_0 | It's about you. You were so insistent on that. And the reason I was asking you these questions was for you to to for you to have some self reflection and think about it. I was asking you questions. Wasn't accusing you of anything. You're the one who chose to answer the questions you chose you the way you did. I mean, why would you insist that you time. Maybe | 434.147015 | 468.657015 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it's Like maybe please. | 468.657015 | 437.03889300000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Maybe it's because my dad was in fucking Vietnam. Maybe it's because I fucking I I'm trying to fucking like, sympathize or what the fuck ever with that. Maybe maybe it's because I fucking truly think that when a fucking person is Fucking being shot at trying to fucking survive and they fucking see past each other's fucking race and fucking get each other's back. Maybe I respect that ideal a fucking level that's fucking Fucking, just wrong, I guess. I don't know. I don't know. Don't know. I don't know. I don't know. | 437.23889 | 516.0870150000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I don't know what? What does that mean? So when Why does that mean you fight with me about it and not just like be it's like | 483.01889000000006 | 524.897015 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like think about what you're saying. I mean, like, do you think that people just because they were, like, in war together, where they were fighting other people that didn't do anything to them, that they could | 491.14889000000005 | 536.877015 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, | 502.88889 | 502.95889 |
| SPEAKER_3 | now we also brainwashed by the system just as you have or I have or and everybody else has. Into hating other people, And you think of these things that are false? They're also victims whether or not sure. I'm not saying that they're just inherently bad people even though they were in war with these people, They were in war with these people fighting people who also didn't do anything to them. They were killing innocent people. I wanna believe that everybody do like, would never do this stuff to each other either. But it won't change if that's what we do. Do you think that there's a better way you could have responded to me instead of, like, pretending I had no valid point over and over again, like, by me asking you whether or not you really were saying it wasn't racist or is that really still what you believe? | 503.11889 | 614.487015 |
| SPEAKER_2 | This entire night, could have gone better. Senator Patrick. No. I'm going to answer the question. Like, I do believe that my reactions could have been better and the fucking this entire fucking negative track that we're on. Could have been avoided. Is that | 584.53889 | 647.9670150000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I know. | 614.0088900000001 | 649.037015 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I know. I know. I'm just asking. Is is that that an answer to your | 649.037015 | 652.247025 |
| SPEAKER_1 | question? Not at | 652.247025 | 653.047015 |
| SPEAKER_0 | all. | 653.047015 | 653.537015 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I asked you if there was some another way a better way you could have responded to me | 621.10889 | 661.5670150000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Are you asking for that better way, like, an | 661.8070150000001 | 664.0770150000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | There | 631.60888 | 631.64887 |
| SPEAKER_0 | is a | 665.956995 | 666.037015 |
| SPEAKER_2 | denying | 667.1170050000001 | 667.6170050000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | him being that you were denying there being a possibility it was racist. | 634.5088900000001 | 672.0770150000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. I was not. I was acknowledging the possibility that he that the pa the possibility possibility that he isn't racist. Right. Hey. It does exist in the realm of possibility. Just like the possibility When I when I when I more likely possibility that he is racist. Both possibilities exist. | 638.0088900000001 | 694.4970350000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I wasn't even trying to say I I mean, the point really was that what he said was racist Whether or not he's a flaming racist or not is different. That's regardless of the fact that what he said was racist. But you just said to me that either, like, you Your behavior, whatever thing you could have done differently and it would have been a lot better, gone gone a | 661.03892 | 721.467015 |
| SPEAKER_1 | lot smoother | 721.467015 | 721.8270150000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So then if it's not that, then what what do you think that it was that you did that was not right, or that you could've done better to, like, avoid the exact same Conflict. Like, what is it that you are even saying that you could've done better then? | 687.91889 | 738.687015 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I could've voiced the fucking harm. Recognizing both possibilities. Opposed to just trying to | 704.81889 | 748.697015 |
| SPEAKER_0 | k. | 714.78889 | 715.28889 |
| SPEAKER_3 | That was my whole point, was that, no, it wasn't There wasn't both possibilities. The point was they you brought up this This story and I was trying to tell you that this is another instance of you bringing up a story where there's a black guy that's the bad guy and the white guy is the good guy. | 734.5088900000001 | 792.497015 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I did not say either of them were the good guy or the bad guy. I think both of them were in the wrong. | 758.18889 | 798.127015 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Do you know what chastise means? Did you use it incorrectly? I wasn't I wasn't. | 798.127015 | 803.456995 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Was talking about fucking, like, | 769.59889 | 805.5570150000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | What is chastise me? Do not | 772.52889 | 808.447015 |
| SPEAKER_3 | listen or, like, listen to | 774.37889 | 809.967015 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the point. Funniest | 809.967015 | 811.119015 |
| SPEAKER_2 | or funny and make But part of your saying | 811.119015 | 816.0870150000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Unjustly, | 816.247015 | 816.747015 |
| SPEAKER_0 | though. Punished. Or criticized. | 816.967015 | 819.767015 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Used the word wrong. Thank you for inviting me. Truly, I'm not fucking being sarcastic. I'm not bullshitting. I'm fucking being genuine here. I fucking did not know that that fucking unjustly was part of that definition. I straight up Did not fucking know that. I used the word completely wrong. | 786.1488899999999 | 844.147015 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I'm not saying that don't know for sure the | 816.5889099999999 | 853.867015 |
| SPEAKER_3 | definition of that word, but it is always using that | 820.03889 | 857.0570150000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | sense or most of the time it's used in that sense whenever you're talking about, like, when you're bringing up | 822.98887 | 862.177015 |
| SPEAKER_3 | in that context, Brian, it's the only way it could have meant was that he was unjustly criticized or attacked or whatever. I'm | 828.18889 | 870.956995 |
| SPEAKER_0 | pretty sure it is usually, it means unjustly. | 870.956995 | 873.937015 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But the only in that context, the only way you could have meant that was that you thought it was unfair because the re the response was to me talking about a white man getting off on murdering a black dude on a subway. And you said, and then they wanna criticize Epic Beard man We're knocking out a black dude. Or whatever. That was that was what you said in response to me So I don't know how you're saying, like, in that context, you could have understood it to mean something differently. Are you telling me that's not, like, actually what you're, like, are you telling me I'm wrong? | 840.2588900000001 | 910.8869950000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. You're not wrong. Like, I fucking like, my my entire that entire fucking train of thought is fucking stupid, wrong, and I shouldn't have fucking said it. Like, Well, you fucking I I Fucking thinking error. Like Do | 878.28889 | 940.387015 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you think that that's the issue that I have? You think that that's what I'm, like, upset with you about? | 940.387015 | 944.957015 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. I think you're upset with me for not fucking thinking before I fucking say shit No. That's and then saying shit and then fucking have a remote fucking position to have even said it. And then fucking | 911.76889 | 958.2970150000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Be open to, like, listening to a different perspective and, like, learning and learning things you've learned. Maybe. I I am open to it. What do you mean? That's that that whole thing was you not being open to accepting any other thing. You weren't so defensive about it that I was just I mean, I was just questioning your beliefs on that or your understanding on that. I didn't even see the video. | 987.037896 | 1008.437897 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's that's where I don't think that you that you that you're understanding my my position. Like, because I wasn't saying that he I wasn't claiming that he wasn't No. What I what I was trying to what I was trying to convey is that it is possible that he wasn't racist. It that, like, that possibility existed. I I wasn't outright saying the shit. I have no grounds for saying that he's not racist. I have no grounds for dude. Like, I don't. | 1008.497896 | 1042.807898 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But but how was it a response to what I said then? I was talking about 1 person doing something horrible to another | 1043.0279 | 1051.967896 |
| SPEAKER_1 | person. Fucking there's no correlation. There's nothing to be fucking if if they weren't equal, that what was fucking stupid The fucking fact that that that shit happened in my fucking head, I can't even fucking explain. | 1052.107896 | 1064.987896 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You called him epic beard man. | 1031.579771 | 1067.967896 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's what the video is called on the on YouTube. I didn't make that shit up. I don't idolize this fucking dude. | 1067.967896 | 1075.087901 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I would've said if I were | 1041.889771 | 1077.717891 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you, | 1077.717891 | 1078.217891 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I would've said fucking racist white dude did this shit, not epic | 1045.169775 | 1082.707896 |
| SPEAKER_2 | beard man. | 1048.879771 | 1083.587896 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's what that's what it | 1083.587896 | 1084.547896 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I know. I don't know him by this name, but the fact that that's what you call him. Is what I'm saying. And why would you not just say, oh, white dude or something? Like, why would that not be a thing? Like, why would it be a | 1084.707896 | 1095.857896 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm Because that's how I've Why is to | 1062.429771 | 1067.389771 |
| SPEAKER_2 | fucking | 1101.847896 | 1102.347896 |
| SPEAKER_1 | whenever I would show somebody else a fucking video, for not even fucking the analysis part of it, but for the fucking So, like, clown on the way the dude said fucking amber lamps when he said when he fucking says call the ambulance. Like, that's, like, the reason why I've I've watched that video multiple times. Is because fucking people have made other videos off of that fucking making fun of other songs like fucking Black Betty Fucking Woah, Black Betty and Yeah. | 1068.509771 | 1106.129771 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I I I get it. It's just that, like, those are all racist thing and people doing that kind of stuff though. So either you okay. Either you think that the guy was fucking you think that the whole situation was a racist interaction or not. I mean, I mean people get upset when people say things that are hurtful such as harkening back to, you know, how much to spit shy my shoes. You don't think that that's a justified reason for somebody to get upset? When they've been like sat here, I mean, they're still dealing with this shit today, They have, like, they're showing no fucking sense of, like, they're not, like, shown I mean, I just don't understand, like, how you can't, like, I mean, I get it. You wanna distance yourself from that. I don't, I mean, I get it. | 1140.437896 | 1195.457896 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But | 1162.6497709999999 | 1162.999771 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you're not playing victim by empathizing with people. I mean, if you can imagine the people who are, like, who've not been able to get out of their fucking situations and not had any chance for upward, upward mobility, like your father, which is a good thing. It is a good thing. There's nothing wrong with that whatsoever. But everybody should be able to do that, but some people aren't. So just just act like a little Some people did it, and so they if they can't, then that's on them kind of thing. It's kinda like no because it is being done to them. It's not their fault. Regardless of how bad they are. It's fine. Like, I understand that there's like shitty people in those in areas of, like, in areas where there's a high number of black people, brown people, whatever, and they're living in poverty, living off of welfare, But these are all Band Aids and these are all like band aids and excuses for just fucking treating them like shit and like acting like they're the reasons for all of our problems. And their own But you remembered even a different story. Like a completely different story. And the one you remembered made it out, like, there was the antagonist and protagonist. And which one was which? | 1162.999771 | 1299.297896 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I think they were both antagonists. | 1267.849771 | 1270.539751 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Your story was not the story that actually played out though, Brian. I'm | 1304.987896 | 1308.4179159999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | telling you what I what I think of the situation. Having watched it just now, | 1308.4179159999999 | 1313.687896 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I But that's not what we're talking about. I wanna talk about, like, what we were like, what the fight was about. | 1280.659771 | 1319.467896 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The fight was about me making an association that had no fucking they had no right to be associated. | 1286.439771 | 1329.917896 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm asking you to be, like, self Like, reflect on your way to, like, to tell me this story in a way that didn't actually happen and what that would mean if you said way, you said it that way. | 1296.209771 | 1344.707896 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It means that fucking I saw shit differently than how shit was. Correct? | 1310.559771 | 1317.999771 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yes. You did, but I'm I'm you know what I'm asking you to do, not just say obviously, yeah. That's what I've said. But I wanna know, like, I'm trying to I'm trying to tell I'm trying to show you, Brian, because I don't want you to because I'm not trying to call you racist. I'm not trying to tell you you're racist. I don't think that you're racist at all. I'm trying to show you your your thinking, like, how you, like, think about things is actually It's harmful to, like, Think that way. Trying to show you what I mean every time I say that you always defend white people like, at the chance like any chance that you can, what would never jump on the chance to defend like, tell a story or talk about it story or talk about, like, the fact that black people are, like, dealing with white people other than yourself. You talk about experiencing racism a lot. I've never heard you talk about anybody else experiencing racism. | 1318.469771 | 1414.327896 |
| SPEAKER_0 | If you had to take all of the races That we are defined by and put them in a hierarchy how do you think society would place them? | 1526.812722 | 1538.2827229999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Why do you call black and brown? | 1539.7627229999998 | 1541.462722 |
| SPEAKER_0 | That's what I mean when I'm not trying to fight with you ever. When you say things and it's okay. I'm not I'm not mad at you for saying them. I mean, maybe I maybe I have, like, been Maybe I get, like, 2, like, I lose my fucking patience too soon or too like much more quickly now. But it's because I already know exactly what's where it's going and it already it goes there. There's no, like there's nothing different about it. I'm asking you questions and instead of like if you disagree if you truly disagree with me, then why don't you just ask me questions and try to convince me to think differently? Why don't you? Why does it not matter to you that I do think it's racist? If don't think it's I'm not saying you do because if you truly like, realize what I'm saying or, like, realize or Just know what you said. I'm just saying in those cases or, for example, like, If you think that I'm wrong, if I'm wrong, about you being wrong, convince me. Why don't you ask me questions? Make me challenge my own thinking or self reflect on my thinking. I want you to do that. I would I mean, I ask you questions all the time. Because I'm trying to understand and I'm trying to, like, I don't know. But It's a losing battle because if you don't if you can't answer a question, instead of thinking about why you can't answer it, you say, oh my god or Jesus Christ and then you get frustrated and you then it just goes downhill from there. And this is a pattern. This is a pattern. I'm talking about, like, the initial starting of the fights not when we're fighting the things that we do because we both yell at each other, we both cut each other off, we both, like, we both do those things, and that's whenever things get tense and tense, and they shouldn't it shouldn't get to that point. But that's why I wanna talk to you about these I, like, I'm | 1543.2727209999998 | 1665.114598 |
| SPEAKER_1 | been trying to tell you and that I want to do. Is come to, like, this, like, understanding of what we, like, how we avoid getting to this, like, the point where we're, like, screaming at each other. And not listening at all, or cutting each other off, But in order to do that, we have to identify, like, what went wrong and what needed to be | 1665.594588 | 1728.902723 |
| SPEAKER_0 | different. | 1728.902723 | 1729.152723 |
| SPEAKER_1 | What should have been different? I mean, like, who did what wrong? | 1695.4045979999999 | 1732.942723 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And | 1700.4345979999998 | 1700.594588 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I always come to the conclusion that it's me telling you how I feel. It's it | 1734.902713 | 1739.312723 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it's not It's not usually how you feel that puts me at ends it's it's I I recognize the lack of patience Like, whatever whenever I say something, like, that fucking doesn't jive, It like, the tension fucking drops It, like, immediately. Like, | 1739.412723 | 1738.574568 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't think this. I think that you just get defensive because you're trying to tell me right now that I can't just be tell you I literally was only asking you questions at first, Brian. That's it. I just asked you, like, I don't fucking know. I mean, I was not immediately like, impatient with you on this at all. I couldn't believe what you were telling me because it was the same old thing, and I don't like, I'm sorry. It is frustrating that I've tried to tell this so many times. But you always come to like this, you always have this story about how white people are being treated badly or how black people are just like being shitty to white people. Something like like you always you always have these stories and I've told tried to tell you this so many times and every time I do, But It it it ends up, like, horribly. Like, you don't care to, like, you don't you don't care to get my perspective You don't ask me questions and try to change my mind. But when I'm trying to make you self reflect, you get frustrated. | 1740.1045679999997 | 1840.052743 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's not true. Like, I do fucking care about your perspective. I do. But And, like, | 1806.2245979999998 | 1847.3427229999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But why do you not try like, then why wait. What do you mean? It's not that you don't if you do, then why did you not why you're not asking me questions to understand my perspective? You're saying you just understand. And that's the part that's the problem right there. That is a huge problem. I don't know, like, how you think that that's acceptable. But anything, but yet, I'm sitting here asking you questions, or you're being defensive. Stop it. I mean, stop. Stop. Stop it. Stop it. | 1813.734598 | 1938.9527229999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | No. Stop it. Stop. Stop. | 1926.334598 | 1963.862723 |

| SPEAKER_2 | case for Trump to win. | 427.839129 | 429.219129 |

| SPEAKER_2 | clear, he said. But I think | 427.340984 | 463.27576899999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | we need to be | 463.27576899999997 | 464.049119 |
| SPEAKER_1 | careful. The fact that his justice department would do it for him, which is taps a harbinger of what he will be expecting in his second preaching. Vietnam | 464.049119 | 473.479129 |
| SPEAKER_2 | better | 473.479129 | 473.879119 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Sure enough. The next day, I | 477.289109 | 478.389119 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Tuesday, | 445.040994 | 445.240994 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Trump filed an absurd lawsuit | 479.549119 | 481.269119 |
| SPEAKER_2 | against | 481.269119 | 481.669119 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Des Moines | 481.669119 | 482.189119 |
| SPEAKER_3 | ahead and eye. Why did you say watching him fucking draw attention to himself. And fucking I don't know what I don't understand this paradox for a fucking when black people are like like some black people, when they're in public fucking just get loud as fuck and then, like, drop of attention to themselves, but then get mad when people fucking are looking at them. So, like | 452.091014 | 508.569119 |
| SPEAKER_2 | When did that happen? | 508.649139 | 509.629119 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It happens all the | 476.180994 | 511.689119 |
| SPEAKER_2 | time. | 511.689119 | 512.079119 |

| SPEAKER_0 | just generate that? | 561.057397 | 562.197397 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Because there's a 1000000 of videos of this being said to black people. What do | 562.357396 | 565.477397 |
| SPEAKER_0 | you mean? What do you mean? | 565.477397 | 567.037398 |

| SPEAKER_2 | tons of people black people getting this shit said said to them. Or racial is fucking stupid shit said to them. What do you mean? I don't | 546.409272 | 591.957397 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't think it was racially charged. Well, how | 557.969272 | 594.437397 |
| SPEAKER_0 | not? Why not? I guess. Like, why? | 594.437397 | 597.217397 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Because when the fucking black dude fucking responds in time, he fucking starts like, the white dude just fucking gets up and fucking walks to the front of the bus. Like, fucking, I I wasn't trying to fucking do all this shit, basically. And the fucking guy, dude, fucking follows him up to the front of the bus, and fucking starts, like, talking shit to him Like, he's why do you stand up, why do you sit down?

| SPEAKER_0 | I | 600.459272 | 600.9392720000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | mean, | 635.2473970000001 | 635.4973970000001 |

I know you're not it kind of is. Right. Don't do that. I'm not excusing either of them. | 602.9492720000001 | 662.227393 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I was just telling you the way to destroy | 628.6792720000001 | 664.7473970000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the video. Why isn't it why are you looking like it was cross sizing the white guy and not the black guy? | 664.7473970000001 | 670.4073970000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Right. Not the thing. I was going kinda turning the story in the video. Right? Hello? You said | 641.5492820000001 | 681.417397 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you said that you're saying that you're saying that you're saying that you're saying that you're saying that you're saying that you're saying that you're saying that you're saying that you're saying that you're saying that you dude veteran guy with a beard man, like a beard man or whatever. So that was | 681.417397 | 690.5073970000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you. Right. | 690.6473970000001 | 657.289272 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Saying you don't think that he should have been checked for what he did because that was not sad. That was not wrong. | 657.609272 | 697.9674070000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Right. Right to them, put it in the wrong. | 666.0692720000001 | 703.167397 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But then why should you have not been profiled? It's being racist. I mean, that's a completely different issue on its own. | 670.279272 | 711.547397 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I don't think it was. And | 679.309272 | 715.7773970000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I want to ask you why you don't think it was. | 715.7773970000001 | 718.037397 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Because fucking old white men and fucking tend to be smart assholes. | 684.1592820000001 | 721.7673970000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So when are | 688.319272 | 723.427397 |
| SPEAKER_4 | they | 723.427397 | 723.927397 |
| SPEAKER_1 | What | 694.069272 | 694.569272 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I'm trying to | 729.417397 | 731.9973970000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | is if it wasn't like, if the black dude wasn't black, if he was fucking white, if he fucking Asian, even if he took advantage. I believe that he would have. | 698.229272 | 741.087397 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Is racist. How was that racist? How is it not racist? I mean, what do you mean? Why? That's why I'm asking you. In what case, would it have been my sister that that you're a black person? If it wouldn't have been fucking, like, instigated, like, a fucking I Exactly. Racism is instigated? | 786.6062539999999 | 805.246256 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Races. They come out. They're not fucking races. Because at some point, had to depend on somebody that was a different fucking colors in | 908.545154 | 914.775154 |

| SPEAKER_4 | be fucking racist. | 1137.335154 | 1138.295154 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. I didn't ask. Didn't say no. It's not a matter whether it can be racist. The reason why people were chastising him is because he was racist. Excusing people's beliefs because they're old is not is not the way you do things. They're still wrong. You say that this is something that, you know, it's not racist because You know? That's just how old men are or whatever. And then, basically, he would say to anybody. You think he would say it to anybody. For no reason at all. But you can't show me an example of this being a thing that people tell white people. Or the this is a thing where you see old Pentankar's white men say this to white people. So I don't understand how you could just say like Show | 1138.295154 | 1204.545154 |

| SPEAKER_4 | I don't understand, like, what that would prove anyways. What what do you mean? Like, | 1181.087049 | 1187.997029 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't How would it | 1222.3051540000001 | 1223.425154 |
| SPEAKER_3 | not prove something? Well, so based you're just saying that it wouldn't prove anything because white people aren't racist against black people ever. Like, I don't understand why we wouldn't prove anything. That's | 1223.425154 | 1232.425154 |
| SPEAKER_4 | not what | 1232.425154 | 1232.745154 |

| SPEAKER_3 | But you ask, like, like, I'm trying to tell you that your experience doesn't matter, but what are you doing to else? I'm not trying to do that. I'm trying to get you to see the other people's experience who are suffering from this kind of issue. Like I said, whenever you bring up stuff, I don't know I don't know enough about, I don't argue with you about it. And I don't, like, even say anything | 1280.357029 | 1355.985154 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Understand the connection between ocean heat and extreme weather. The state of the climate 2,000 24 report says between 2005 and 2023, the ocean absorbed an average approximately 3,100,000 terawatt hours of heat. This is more than 18 times the world's energy consumption in 2023. According to the Glaseous Clapeyron equation, for every 1 degree rise in global average temperature, there would be a 7% rise in atmospheric moisture levels. The impacts of this are evidenced by recent extreme weather events | 0 | 35.559999999999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | hurricanes, cyclones, torrential rains, and others. In we take the case of India, let's look at this graph. It shows day wise extreme weather events in India in the 1st 9 months of 2024. 255 days of extreme weather events out of 274 days. Last year, the numbers were lower at 235 days for the same period. 3,238 people lost their lives due to such events in 2,034. Compared to 2,755 in 2022. A rise of 18% in just 3 years. So what does the future hold? In 2034, carbon dioxide emissions are expected to be 52% higher than preindustrial levels. The 2,024 global carbon budget warns that at current rates, we'll exhaust the current budget for 1.5 degree Celsius in just 6 years. Even the 2 degree Celsius limit could be breached within 27 years. For generation alpha, this means living with higher sea levels, more extreme weather, and shrinking chances of turning things around. So the final question is, can we act in time to give them a chance for a safer future? Or test their survival as we witness greater losses. | -0.1781250000000063 | 117.50999999999999 |

| SPEAKER_1 | I think that there are bad people in the world, and I think that there's a lot of kind, generous, wonderful people. That are fighting against Ebola. And I think that either way, we can only really to our life as students, and then we can try to what we can as individuals to make the world a better place. | -41.24812500000001 | 15.149999999999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Do you thank men do you thank men for giving women the right to vote? | -18.67812500000001 | 19.07 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I would say that Inherently, was it however it happened? I mean, I understand men played a huge part in women's having the right to vote. But I I would say that either way, that doesn't make women of any less value or men of any less value. I think that culture changes and shifts, and, You know, we're in a much different place now than we were back before women had the right to vote. So I would like to speak to the right here and now if that's okay. So wait. I hear you saying that you don't wanna talk about the general culture. Of the USA | -9.318125000000002 | 75.93 |
| SPEAKER_3 | and people in the USA not liking or protecting women. You don't like to acknowledge the that's a thing. You don't like to acknowledge that your friend's story helps so many people because a large majority of people have been in situations like that. A large majority of women. I understand you don't wanna talk about that and that you wanna talk about your own personal experience. So I guess that I'll ask you from your own personal experience Can you give us an example of something that your husband has protected you from actively? | 41.94187499999999 | 105.99000000000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Sure. First, I'd like to acknowledge that I'm hearing you putting words in my mouth, and I don't appreciate | 75.581875 | 116.53999999999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Hear again? So I guess that I'll ask you from your own personal experience, Can you give us an example of something that your husband has actively? | 116.70000000000002 | 91.96187499999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Sure. First, I'd like to acknowledge that I'm hearing you putting words in my mouth, and I don't appreciate that. But As far as what my husband has protected me from, I just Think on a daily basis, he's protective of me and of our family. I think that, okay. I'll give you one example. We used to live in a very unsafe neighborhood. We didn't know that it was unsafe when we, decided to live there. You know, we just we're looking up houses on this or whatever, and we found one. That was reasonably priced, and it looked nice enough. When we moved in, we found out it was not a great neighborhood. And, and while we were there, you know, we would hear gunshots, almost, nightly and there was a lot of drug stuff going on. And, there was more than one time that my husband had to get up in the middle of the night and, to go out to figure out what was going on outside. You know, there were a lot of shady here, and there's that we'd come by our house and flood out, like my children are wearing safe to play outside. We only stayed the first few months and got Now we own a house somewhere else, but that's fine. That's the | 96.67187500000003 | 214.22 |
| SPEAKER_4 | way to do it. Okay. | 214.22 | 215.08 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm being willing to lay down at white even your kids | 183.081895 | 227.67 |

Like, what was so like, so there were drugs in the area. Like, what was okay, do you need to give us specific kind of pain points? | 254.98002 | 273.35999999999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. Sure. I I would be happy to clarify. No. There were no drugs in my home. There was a lot of drug activity in my neighborhood. There was we lived across from a drug dealer, and there was another one down the street. I'm | 240.49187499999996 | 287.45 |
| SPEAKER_3 | pretty | 287.45 | 287.77 |
| SPEAKER_1 | sure there was one | 287.77 | 288.5 |
| SPEAKER_5 | it | 255.55187499999997 | 255.711875 |
| SPEAKER_3 | was a | 290.02 | 290.34 |
| SPEAKER_1 | very That's true. | 290.34 | 290.73999999999995 |

| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know what what else to call. | 299.67001999999997 | 301.84997999999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I did get a I did get a $5 retip from Buck. Buck said, can you ask Holler why she can't just answer a question normally instead of rambling 6 minutes about something vaguely related? | 301.90997999999996 | 311.46999999999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But, Okay. I'm sorry. I have many words. I'm a writer. So I | 279.451875 | 325.58 |
| SPEAKER_4 | apologize. | 325.58 | 325.81 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I will try to be more direct with my answers. | 292.061875 | 328.15 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Taylor also sent a a a read tip and said if y'all were hearing gunshots why would your man go outside? 10 survival skills. | 328.28999999999996 | 336.20002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Our house that and he would go out | 310.33187499999997 | 347.57 |
| SPEAKER_5 | and | 314.701895 | 314.86189499999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | he himself was on to make sure that nobody was gonna try to get by us. And more than one time, he put himself in harm's way to protect our neighbors as well. Oh, give an example. A | 349.17001999999997 | 362.07 |
| SPEAKER_5 | lot of that | 362.07 | 362.96999999999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | The big example would be great because it sounds like he's just inserting himself into other people's business and but so far, what you're saying, right, is that he was, like, insertion cell into situations that he wasn't a part of that put your family in danger. And was judgmental of the neighbors. | 329.09187499999996 | 382.20002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | That sounds | 382.20002 | 383.02002999999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | so a specific example of how he protected you would be great. | 348.941855 | 387.09 |

| SPEAKER_4 | but this | 380.62187499999993 | 415.25 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I didn't hear anything | 415.72999999999996 | 416.69 |
| SPEAKER_3 | before I heard | 383.501875 | 418.72999999999996 |

| SPEAKER_1 | I'm I'm laughing at this. My action items, get back in the car and retrieve the forgotten backpack. This is really funny. I don't know. This is literally, like, the conversation that it gathered from 657 to 7 so just like 16 minutes of our conversation in the car, I guess. Because it it considers a con conversation where there's been a conversation has ended when there's 2 minutes of silence. So we're talking whatever. If there's 2 minutes of silence where it doesn't, like, any more of the transcript, it's it considers that the end of a conversation. Or | 495.96934999999996 | 542.33935 |
| SPEAKER_2 | whatever. | 576.647475 | 576.677475 |

| SPEAKER_0 | if | 766.507475 | 766.6674350000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I needed think about it, I might remember. I mean, that's weird. Why don't they just make it 4 inches? Right? Like, it's not a big deal that it's like only that it's not actually like, come on. It's not a big deal. Necessarily that it's not actually 2 by 4, but don't you just make it by 2 by 4 and then you won't be lying? I mean, it's gotta make their gotta make put people's project in, like, precise and fucked up. Right? I would think. | 766.6674350000001 | 806.267475 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Maybe? Not not if the | 773.25935 | 808.977475 |
| SPEAKER_1 | know that. I mean, I'm assuming that they do, | 775.78935 | 812.097475 |
| SPEAKER_2 | but | 812.097475 | 812.327475 |
| SPEAKER_1 | still, it would be easier if it was 4 inches. Right? Wait. Was that was that irony or whatever? Sarcasm or something? | 778.17931 | 827.7774750000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I have no idea. | 795.12935 | 830.337475 |

| SPEAKER_2 | says, like, 3 summers ago. | 428.265354 | 429.56535399999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | What was it? | 395.84722899999997 | 431.05535399999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 327? | 431.595354 | 432.095354 |

| SPEAKER_2 | A what? | 411.16722899999996 | 446.135354 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It's 109 or The Kingston. Is that 109 or | 412.137229 | 448.765354 |
| SPEAKER_3 | 104? That's 104. Yeah. So that's that's that's | 448.765354 | 453.49535399999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. | 420.92722899999995 | 421.16722899999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But if our tip out | 455.475354 | 456.355354 |
| SPEAKER_3 | was only | 456.355354 | 457.085354 |
| SPEAKER_0 | forties, but I think | 422.777229 | 458.93535399999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So if I took that with only $47, I only gave her 40. | 427.30720899999994 | 464.915354 |
| SPEAKER_0 | $40. | 431.137229 | 431.637229 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It should be | 466.725354 | 467.36533399999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | oh, it | 467.605354 | 467.92533399999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it should be 400 and 10. But | 467.92533399999996 | 435.707229 |
| SPEAKER_3 | what | 470.475354 | 470.555374 |
| SPEAKER_1 | about the $7 would | 470.555374 | 471.835374 |
| SPEAKER_3 | be coming out? The | 471.835374 | 472.87535399999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | $7 would be | 472.87535399999996 | 473.595354 |
| SPEAKER_0 | in | 473.595354 | 473.915354 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's why I only subtract 40 from 4,450. So that's what we start to joy with. It's 450. And I didn't have, like I mean, there's no other, like, reason why I would have less. Anything I would have more people committing past. It's something that's right? Mhmm. That would mean in order for it to be that much less, I need to think ahead like, hardly anybody pay in cash. | 439.767229 | 511.06535399999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So That's | 477.80720899999994 | 488.24724899999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's, like, your fucking total that's all of them right there. | 489.637229 | 526.565354 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Wait. What? Oh, that's what I'm saying. The fact that it's only credit card, that means that, like, it should be 450 minus at least the credit card tips. Okay? The fact that that much more | 494.24722899999995 | 537.295334 |
| SPEAKER_0 | is $327. | 537.295334 | 538.195324 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Okay. | 539.695324 | 540.195324 |

| SPEAKER_4 | may be the dominant language in the United States, but one form of English. Most by us is Midland American, or North Midland. My So way of talking that doesn't sound like any specific accent None be so distant. Newscasters come from all over America to Columbus to study the way we speak. There might be a reason | 699.884108 | 798.1122330000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | for | 798.1122330000001 | 798.2722329999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | that. I'm I'm not from here. This is true from Canada. | 798.2722329999999 | 801.692233 |

| SPEAKER_1 | them. | 866.832263 | 867.0922330000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | The great migration of black people moving from the South to the North and West can explain why the rapper coming kind of has this other draw, In part, to language ideology. To blame which ideology black people or Latinos women, the working class, and people currently living in the South bear the brunt of negative stereotypes or acknowledges it or not, We extensively change one's importance and intelligence based on how we speak. | 832.9441079999999 | 916.622233 |

| SPEAKER_1 | US today. Or force the depression of wages to as low as they can This results in decolonialism for capitalist gain in Oh, secure markets, and secure be unemployment, All of this degradation of infrastructure, and limitations on the access base. Republican or Democrat, liberal, conservative, it doesn't matter. It still happens. Can we hear about socialism Not only is it projection, those that promote capitalism like the poverty. Than any of the evidence. What of the Black Book of Communism The number of 100,000,000 can realistically be traced only to this academic work, and I use those words loosely. | 154.37 | 316.488125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Wow. Oh, wow. | 303.07998 | 348.05812499999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Because, you know, that makes sense. Basically, fertility rates went down in, for example, 8 times. A woman who would have had 4 kids now only had 2, have more kids in the family. It's Oh, wow. Fucking ridiculous this is. Counting propharmists that would brown out the majority of Jews And finally, the nail in the coffin is that 2 of the 3 main officers publicly distanced If you're interested in a more detailed dive into the the sad excuse of a book, take a look at Revolution Left Radio's episode on it. But We can move on to an actually productive Hello? To one very special dislike American foreign policy and government as a direct result of American action in and around the countries. The sacred very rarely extends to regular American people, likewise victims of the same oppressive structures in other ways. Despite the time being beneficiaries of the carnage and dimensions the US carries out globally. Today's country is it on. With an ancient cultural heritage going back 1000 of years and boasting the oldest declaration of human For priority's sake, we'll start with the 20th century, specifically, 1920 1, 1, during which the British supported into It was not a normal coup, however, and while Rilla was really in charge from his post s I when he was crowned Mark, as will become a theme in this video, motivating factor for this school was the forced oil. | 333.72999999999996 | 541.2381250000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Alright. Dan, do you disagree with any of the announcements on the board? Yes. | 542.9821469999999 | 548.6121469999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It was kind of so for the Cummins and Gutter Cleaning, | 548.6121469999999 | 552.0321469999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Alina, you were basically dead on the | 555.852147 | 558.432147 |
| SPEAKER_1 | 2138. Dead on the money. That is crazy. Okay, Dan. So I my apologies. Yeah. | 524.72402 | 533.7840219999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So I'd ask you. I'd be like, I | 568.092147 | 570.1121469999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | as sort of, like, as the abolition of private property or, like, if I wanted to find it, like, in a really broad sense, I say money. Which the means of production have been granted to the community as a whole. | 544.15402 | 598.832147 |
| SPEAKER_2 | K. So, like, I feel like practical person where if I look at cognitive metabolism, see capitalism very much like the garden for And I have a bit of time to use when they can go. Can I | 567.594022 | 624.812147 |
| SPEAKER_1 | see the better? | 624.812147 | 625.552147 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Much better, more wholesome ideology whereas the world today, I go if I want for at least a there are many of people, like free health care, How is he I see that | 592.724022 | 644.3721469999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a | 611.344022 | 611.4240219999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | better way we're not back at the pathway to this is something like that. Would be through, like, a strong central government providing social services to people within the capital of society And I don't know about the big bucks. | 611.8240219999999 | 660.2421469999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Sorry, Ricky. | 630.454032 | 666.5221469999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The problem is | 632.374022 | 667.682147 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Social services is just a way for capitalism to pass the of responsibility for paying people a livable wage onto other people in the working class. | 634.104022 | 680.5221469999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So | 651.3940319999999 | 651.484022 |
| SPEAKER_1 | we're we're paying for for welfare and SNAP benefits and unemployment and all that through our taxes, it's because the businesses are not paying Walmart is one of the is I think it's the number one employer of welfare and snappers A Walmart or grocery store. Eat pays its so little that they have to go on welfare and SNAP benefits. To afford to buy a burger. They work in a grocery store. This is a dystopia. | 655.6740219999999 | 723.2821469999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Obviously, because they work there and they | 693.8240119999999 | 730.0021469999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Like, we may not have been passed to force large corporations to pay with more of a fair share providing these social services so that they all had passed on to, like, the So what you know, for the blimp that we're in, that it it it not happening but I can get past 4 where it could happen compared to past where, you know, the whole tablet, which I have a little bit in | 705.7940219999999 | 774.912147 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Sorry. I'm chewing. I don't wanna chew on my throat. Okay. The biggest issue here Like, at its core, I think capitalism is unethis. | 748.9740219999999 | 799.642147 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Reason I | 766.534052 | 801.322147 |
| SPEAKER_3 | believe | 801.322147 | 801.722147 |
| SPEAKER_1 | this is because I think it is unethical to own private get I think it really it really showed I think it's unethical to come in purchase a lake of fresh water and then sell that water people. I think it's unethical to own land. Right? I don't I don't understand how we're we're | 801.722147 | 826.7621469999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | we're | 826.7621469999999 | 827.072147 |
| SPEAKER_1 | justifying land ownership in in in the world. Right? I think it's unethical to own private property. Thus, we'll make happen with the long time. The only way to pro to to maximize profit is to undervalue your labor. | 793.1640219999999 | 847.962147 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Going through a ball against the | 938.9005569999999 | 940.6805568999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the owning class. As they continue to be pushed. As they continue to continue and we've and we've seen this In every society, ever, right, we've literally seen that the people in the ruling class tend to get overthrown if they push the lower class too far. And I genuinely think of, capitalism is is going to hit that stage. We may not soon, but definitely hit that stage. before you say, like, you you Only they produce for, like, what you would need based off your ability. How and where do you, like, want to check inside of Cognizant? Because, for help from people. But, like, some people want larger houses, or they want nicer view. How do you how do you I don't care about what people want. I love While there's still | 941.840557 | 1006.980557 |
| SPEAKER_2 | people that need to be liberated, I don't care about the wants of of people that have already been liberated. | 972.8524319999999 | 1012.4005569999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Right. I don't care about that. | 978.562432 | 1014.4305569999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What I want and what I wanna see happen under a communist framework is that the people who are suffering have their needs met. Once we've met everyone need everyone needs, then we can start talking about wants. I don't care that little Jimmy wants a PlayStation. When little when little, Jonathan is a slave. In the Congo because the America wants more iPhones. Right? I don't care that that that Steve from Ohio wants a larger house when Jeff in, Latin America is suffering because the United States is installing big cases for imprisoning his family. Right? The Wats knew nothing until liberation of our nation. | 981.642432 | 1061.000557 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Like, not everybody wants the same things. And also in a sense, a site like that, like, you know, when we're talking about the commitment to the community, Okay. Well, maybe you can get the bigger house, but you have to, you know, contribute 30 hours a week. Versus, like, if you just get the 1 bedroom apartment, you have to contribute 6 hours a week. | 1055.202432 | 1117.080557 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So I'm | 1083.892422 | 1118.520557 |
| SPEAKER_4 | not gonna trade that. | 1118.520557 | 1119.240557 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Personally personally, I think we should we need to demolish a lot of these larger houses | 1119.240557 | 1123.770557 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Can we talk about houses that have, like, 9 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms? Like, why? Why do you need more bathrooms in a bedroom? Like, maybe one extra one, like, for a for a guest bath, but, like, there's a these are ridiculous. | 1099.662432 | 1145.890557 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I think we need to we need | 1112.222442 | 1148.440557 |
| SPEAKER_2 | more half that. | 1114.612432 | 1149.670557 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Just | 1116.122432 | 1116.4424319999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | because, | 1150.7505569999998 | 1151.150557 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, if someone's taking a shower and I have a piss, bro. I got a piss. | 1151.150557 | 1154.7205569999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I love a good half bath. | 1121.612432 | 1157.380557 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Let's | 1129.502422 | 1129.742432 |
| SPEAKER_2 | say let's say America wants to wants to, let's say, we're moving more to a socialist economy system and we and we have to figure out how we do houses. What I would do is the way we set the system up. Is I'd say every house sitting on land has a €100 lease. Right? You get a 100 year lease. In this house. The land is not owned by you. The house is owned by you. But, you know, you can build a | 1164.050557 | 1189.570557 |
| SPEAKER_4 | car | 1189.570557 | 1189.660557 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And, like, whoever wins that lottery, You what? I don't actually know. Well, how you sort of, like, limited resources, like, sort of, like, like, certain, like, types of housing or just, like, | 1254.6251389 | 1289.385139 |
| SPEAKER_1 | some sort of the majority do about what would want They were 1 Have it having to shoot you something like that. Yeah. I sure. I don't think there are limited resources. That's that's my answer. Right? Let's let's take housing, for instance. I don't think there's limited resources when it comes house I just don't think we affect we we officially do housing. Right? Like I said, we have how many, how many large homes that one person or 2 people live in? Right? When you said we can utilize that land to make much more housing. Like, | 1253.1870119999999 | 1324.1751439999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | right, we should be we should be doing stuff like that. | 1324.1751439999998 | 1327.305139 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Many how many older buildings that we can be converted converted into communal living spaces? When it comes to food sources, the the earth, we we throw away on the planet, like, planet wide. More food than than isn't that that is needed. Right? And we think we can all the food waste that we have would | 1293.2370139999998 | 1346.615139 |
| SPEAKER_2 | feed | 1346.615139 | 1346.865139 |
| SPEAKER_1 | everybody. | 1346.865139 | 1347.365139 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Right? | 1313.7170139999998 | 1314.2170139999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Water duplicate duplicative businesses. | 1315.2070139999998 | 1352.415139 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Can | 1352.555139 | 1352.6351439999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | we | 1352.6351439999999 | 1353.1351439999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | repurpose those buildings? Like, how many mattresses or do we need? | 1319.797014 | 1358.0251389999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Pro, I drive past 3 mattress firms. | 1324.35701 | 1361.725129 |
| SPEAKER_4 | To get to the | 1328.117014 | 1363.375139 |
| SPEAKER_1 | How many dollars do you hope for later? | 1330.4470139999999 | 1366.375134 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Spaces. That that takes like, material domain hours And, I mean, if there was a wrapped amount of these sort of resources available now. I mean, like, the reason why certain copies of primary thing. There's one of the | 1341.4470139999999 | 1395.5451389999998 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Very directly what it was that Ira Ira and Kanye West had to use when you submitted, and you said it was the change of vernacular. Right? It was. Yes. So then why Okay. For lack of a little bit here. But they were never allowed to get a step outside of that racial etiquette. We had to get that in a lot of | 265.338296 | 281.878296 |
| SPEAKER_1 | cast, and most of them are old. That's not about that's not about the population. It's not about | 289.538296 | 294.118296 |
| SPEAKER_0 | population Right? | 294.418298 | 273.240171 |
| SPEAKER_1 | We don't have a book on the books official language. We just happen to speak English. Yes. Because that will only lead to people who are down on the That was late. Okay. Well, we can come to a very diverse person in American. The entire melting pot, so to speak. So making it official would be probably extremely problematic and would require a lot of pragmatic So, there's probably a reason why it's not official. But the overall is gonna be limited in there. So there's really no it's nothing to define that or to defeat that purpose, and it's saying it's not efficient. So | 321.000176 | 374.460171 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. All all all I'm saying all | 408.808296 | 409.868296 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm on Mickey. All plenty out there. Is that the idea that all a | 410.008296 | 383.950171 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I didn't | 390.160171 | 424.918296 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It happens. Other stuff does, and it's not a racist concept that is not. It's liberalism that is. Oh, | 393.200171 | 432.958296 |
| SPEAKER_2 | speaking, | 400.930171 | 401.170161 |
| SPEAKER_1 | they're speaking Korean. So Damn. Can't understand those techs, but it's | 435.718296 | 441.598296 |
| SPEAKER_3 | not gonna be | 441.738296 | 442.058296 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a problem. | 442.058296 | 442.808296 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I don't know the answer to it, but the statement is not to continue to learn languages. So we're not able to hear you. Saying your English wasn't even related to the English spoken on this country in this country, | 414.900171 | 467.198296 |
| SPEAKER_1 | right, | 467.65829599999995 | 468.058296 |
| SPEAKER_2 | or on I'll say on this continent. Right? When English was not the language book in English, English was coarse, on the people who lived here by colonizers as for the English. This is my premise. This is why this is why the worst on the American | 468.058296 | 485.378296 |
| SPEAKER_4 | set up. | 486.15829599999995 | 487.878296 |
| SPEAKER_0 | It's just changing over time. Right? I've been talking about? They're crazy. | 618.618822 | 623.048822 |
| SPEAKER_1 | people don't remember the language that they used to speak. And now | 602.570697 | 641.168822 |
| SPEAKER_0 | The slaves, they destroy people's lineage. Right. So they it's like there's linguistic | 714.7160632 | 720.326063 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I do not wanna call you games, but you cannot sit here and stay at the headphones need spoken | 729.936063 | 734.556063 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I didn't say just because white people spoke with the right language. You didn't | 742.346063 | 745.976063 |
| SPEAKER_1 | because that language has been forced onto other And Oh my god. My question. The reason that they urge them to keep in representation What the fuck? Quite what you say to do the ventilator and fly out with operations with that It's | 722.80794 | 851.0479379999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | a debate. | 885.356063 | 886.016063 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So just because you believe it doesn't mean it's a little bit. As being it's gonna be truthful or proven to be biased. This is not what an anecdotal event | 866.927948 | 908.8660629999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. | 877.087938 | 877.567948 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Statements like, oh, I'm gonna change you. Savages language and You you absolutely get more quoting it from a book, and it really doesn't help. People. Yeah. Colonizing for the Yeah. I'm I'm sure. Anyway, like I was saying, like I was saying, it's it's not just I believe that our, concern to me is changing. It's the values of the team. Like, I'm here for understanding not not to hear and apologize, but this is why I told the way to the point when you are claiming that a white spoken language is racist alongside the fact of them putting it on other people, which still isn't racist. That cultural language, at all. To debounce the point of your idea of your category. This 50. That's the true gold answer to take for 1 or not yet to express. They were like that. But there's all the There's going to be a perception of the brain. Just like how the they're not number 1. It's too big drive below. One of these fenders came over and fired guns. Was becoming quite hot with the dot dot, so it sounds like thunder. You have to understand the to having this social conflict and white people. So I'm not gonna disprove your point. Am just saying that most of what you're going at is halfway. You're just demonizing and then standing on the dead grave. It doesn't seem very well. If you could easily point out that there are multiple values and cultural cultures that coalesce in this way. You know? So so the thing you said there, you can dish out a little bit there. | 912.356073 | 1036.836063 |
| SPEAKER_2 | One, 1 directly from the National Museum of American Indians. Although there was a recognition of native rights to own land, official American documents use terms like savage, and uncivilized to describe native people. They quite literally wrote these words in their manual back that they didn't post. Hold on. Hold on. You said that by saying this, I was using anecdote 11. I'm not. This is actual history to claim this anecdote is historic. Second, | 1003.177938 | 1032.707938 |
| SPEAKER_1 | correlate it. That's all. Wanted to know because there's also another thing that you made about, English. And | 1039.797938 | 1044.907938 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm going to get to it if you stop talking. | 1079.216063 | 1082.016063 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm gonna get | 1082.016063 | 1082.8960630000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to it. Jones. I said, I mean, | 1082.8960630000001 | 1085.6660630000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | what's the thing you say? I | 1086.286063 | 1087.636063 |

| SPEAKER_1 | a | 479.201093 | 479.451093 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you're being racist. See, you're making everything about racing or something like that because you didn't say anything about black people. But, like, that's what we're talking about. | 445.382971 | 487.13109299999996 |
| SPEAKER_3 | We'll explain the system. And not people trying to keep you down. Right? It's it's it's That's | 461.512964 | 503.071093 |
| SPEAKER_2 | what's is. Rather a | 503.071093 | 505.571093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Like, The risk is being caused by the system. That needs to change. It's not That's literally the point that I had there. That's what number 4 is. So, yeah, racism is caused by a systemically | 506.681097 | 538.681093 |
| SPEAKER_0 | racist | 538.901093 | 539.381093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | system. | 539.381093 | 539.881093 |
| SPEAKER_4 | That's put into flight by a | 505.582968 | 541.075093 |
| SPEAKER_0 | white person. Cramping | 541.075093 | 541.891093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | on the | 541.891093 | 542.211093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | line. How he literally just fucking, like, Yeah. | 542.211093 | 517.402968 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. So, like, is it like the argument was never that I think that as well, which is what they're what people are trying | 552.251097 | 562.291093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to deny. | 562.291093 | 562.951103 |
| SPEAKER_3 | How was this? It's it's | 534.232968 | 570.0011030000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | think he's trying to say something way more nefarious, and we're just gonna have our mind blown in a | 541.812968 | 580.961083 |
| SPEAKER_0 | second. I have no idea. | 580.981083 | 582.601093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. | 551.892978 | 552.392978 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That too. On the first. | 552.942968 | 589.061093 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Yeah. It was the thing, | 590.401083 | 591.461093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | but | 591.761083 | 592.261083 |
| SPEAKER_2 | he's having a really hard time, though. | 559.072968 | 595.281093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I she left about then. 30 years ago, 40 years ago. | 569.212968 | 607.651093 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I think because you don't see what Martin Luther King or Malcolm x, would be disregarding the massive amounts of work that are under gun in black neighborhoods. The litany of organizations that exist to, like, help | 607.651093 | 586.552968 |
| SPEAKER_3 | with | 620.876093 | 621.376093 |
| SPEAKER_4 | disparities in black neighborhoods. Like, right? I just because you might have to see them, but see that they don't exist. Just because No. No. No. I I | 588.142968 | 630.011093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | of this, Jim. Let me tell you about the oven. | 630.251093 | 632.131093 |
| SPEAKER_4 | The shot the CIA shot and killed them. | 600.372968 | 636.811093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Not like history. It's not mix the same. | 605.8429679999999 | 642.011083 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I thought he said it's not my history, but, yeah, that makes sense too for him. | 611.142978 | 649.131093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Point. | 649.336093 | 649.541093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But I was like, | 615.472978 | 650.421103 |
| SPEAKER_2 | wait. Then why are you fucking invading | 650.421103 | 652.181093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | this? What are | 652.181093 | 652.421103 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you talking about? Maybe I don't know. I don't think he's not he sounds like he's not | 652.421103 | 656.121093 |
| SPEAKER_0 | from the | 656.121093 | 656.441093 |
| SPEAKER_2 | US, so that's why I thought he said that. | 656.441093 | 658.281093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Heat the the | 627.392968 | 662.841093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | He's having | 630.452958 | 665.1610929999999 |

| SPEAKER_2 | he was, like, a debater or, like, any kind of, like, person who professionally speaks, like, speaks or whatever. I | 672.141093 | 678.821093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't know. | 678.821093 | 679.061093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Debate on this. I'm I'm sorry about that. Alright. | 679.141093 | 647.882968 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Will | 682.191093 | 682.511093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | do. | 682.511093 | 683.011093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I would like to I'd like okay. We this is more of a a debate, but you see capitalism is harmful. I've heard you talk about bringing the | 657.542968 | 701.936093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | power of Wait. Hold on one second. | 668.912968 | 757.131093 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yep. Yeah, Helen. | 731.942968 | 767.1610929999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So okay. So the the the capital is down for for the countries that Welcome. Hey, I | 739.982968 | 790.301073 |
| SPEAKER_0 | gotta quit. So Thank | 790.301073 | 793.361093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you. It has nothing to do with the fact that when support is sent to countries, that the country's governments are using the same capital as we say, hey, we're going to increase the taxes on said resources. Checkpoint. No. | 793.6610929999999 | 808.621093 |
| SPEAKER_4 | It doesn't matter about these resources | 808.6810929999999 | 810.361073 |
| SPEAKER_1 | we | 810.361073 | 810.621093 |
| SPEAKER_4 | set, like, what aid being sent to these countries. Look at the history of these countries. These countries have been stripped for the natural resources for fucking all for 100 | 776.552948 | 819.4410929999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of years. | 819.4410929999999 | 820.101093 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Sending them a little bit of data, they can see what it is. But them in charge of their own country and not sending in fascist dictators And when | 786.072968 | 827.5110930000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | America gets a little mad that a country votes in the socialist leader | 827.5110930000001 | 830.481093 |
| SPEAKER_6 | is, you know, kinda stupid. | 796.172968 | 832.4210929999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So I | 832.721093 | 804.192968 |
| SPEAKER_0 | What? I'm gonna put | 805.232968 | 840.501093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | butter. | 840.501093 | 841.001093 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Did you eat my friend's house? So are we | 824.0929679999999 | 860.201093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | always different? I'm | 860.201093 | 861.0810730000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | just | 861.0810730000001 | 861.321093 |
| SPEAKER_5 | kidding. I | 861.321093 | 861.961093 |
| SPEAKER_2 | just wanted to get a reaction. American | 861.961093 | 831.1229679999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | capitalism? Love you. | 865.731093 | 870.071093 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I love you. | 836.322968 | 871.5210930000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I put it I didn't put it anywhere where he could get it. | 838.1729479999999 | 874.9810729999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | He's fine. Maybe he's fine. He's not doing anything. He's singing. Sort of way | 843.572968 | 881.391093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | kind of | 881.391093 | 881.871093 |
| SPEAKER_6 | 1500. UK, | 882.351093 | 884.051093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Saint Peter's | 884.1910929999999 | 885.331093 |
| SPEAKER_6 | any capitalist country is gonna do an imperialism. It means the motive of capitalism is to expand. | 851.3329679999999 | 890.1810929999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's | 890.321093 | 890.821093 |
| SPEAKER_4 | profits, and you can't expand profits without expanding to other regions and, like, increasing your production. Right. In order to increase this production, they tend to expand into countries that have the resources they need | 857.932968 | 904.491093 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to increase their production. | 904.491093 | 905.791093 |
| SPEAKER_6 | And they try to get those, resources for as little money as possible. | 871.562968 | 910.051093 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Bye. And how would a different system be any less harmful? | 883.472968 | 924.821093 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Yep. | 925.361093 | 925.741093 |
| SPEAKER_6 | The socialism would would not put the power inside the business owner. | 891.432968 | 928.781093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It | 928.781093 | 929.061093 |
| SPEAKER_5 | would | 929.061093 | 929.341093 |
| SPEAKER_4 | put the power | 929.341093 | 929.741093 |
| SPEAKER_2 | into No. | 929.741093 | 930.6910929999999 |
| SPEAKER_6 | And the workers are going to make the decisions for everybody. As of so worker the workers collectively together So for instance, if we give you workers the means of production, a country like Chile, where they now have control over their mining operations, they're not going to | 896.6229679999999 | 945.9110929999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | sell America all their resources and get no money in | 911.8429679999999 | 949.2710930000001 |
| SPEAKER_6 | return. | 949.2710930000001 | 949.7010929999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Right? Because they now own those resources. They own that means of mining. Right? Whereas right now, the mining is | 916.432928 | 957.391093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | owned | 957.4510929999999 | 957.531093 |
| SPEAKER_6 | by by a fascist government instead of just giving America whatever they want. For some kickbacks, but without pushing any of that back | 957.531093 | 965.131093 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Brian, go. | 965.291093 | 966.0110930000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Working | 966.1710929999999 | 966.5010930000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | those mines This is how socialism would do this better. | 932.1929680000001 | 969.4710929999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 5. Mhmm. | 935.322968 | 937.002968 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So now you have a a a mine owned by the people. I that mine? I still yet to find someone who can compete for a pure ore or pure coal or whatever. That needs to be translated into a means of bread electricity, water, etcetera, right, basic needs. Uh-huh. They | 972.571123 | 997.401093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | would | 997.401093 | 997.561093 |
| SPEAKER_6 | just sell the resources | 997.561093 | 998.5210930000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like The people does he what does he not understand? The people are the ones who do all of those things. They they do the work. Like, not the people who have money. So what do you mean? It's not like it would be impossible if we didn't fucking capitalists. That doesn't make | 998.5210930000001 | 1010.051093 |
| SPEAKER_5 | sense. Resources, | 1010.051093 | 978.202968 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you're trying to take it | 1012.5110930000001 | 1013.4210929999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to | 1013.4210929999999 | 1013.6710929999999 |
| SPEAKER_6 | market. | 1013.6710929999999 | 1014.151093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Right? | 1014.151093 | 1014.591093 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Right? So America wants to | 980.522968 | 1016.7510629999999 |
| SPEAKER_5 | buy | 1016.7510629999999 | 1016.9110929999999 |
| SPEAKER_6 | copper. | 1016.9110929999999 | 1017.4110929999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And they go, well, this is the only copper mine. What are you gonna do? Kinda have to buy copper from the copper mine. They can't where are they else are they gonna get the copper? Right? | 983.472968 | 991.3929679999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Right. But it's not the only customer. | 993.4429680000001 | 1029.931093 |
| SPEAKER_6 | America | 997.8529679999999 | 998.3529679999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | gets, like, 70% of its resources is copper from | 1032.881093 | 1036.121093 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Chile. | 1002.532968 | 1002.9229680000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Right. But as I said, that is mine 1 of somebody out today. Right? Because Yeah. There are multiple mines of volatility. They were all put in the in the | 1004.9229680000001 | 1048.961093 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Yeah. | 1022.6629679999999 | 1022.822968 |
| SPEAKER_3 | No. So we would | 1057.131093 | 1058.171093 |
| SPEAKER_4 | not allow people to own the | 1058.171093 | 1059.831093 |
| SPEAKER_6 | home. Oh. Yeah. That would be a thing. Uh-huh. | 1059.931053 | 1028.552968 |
| SPEAKER_0 | We could say both are on the copper line. What do you mean workers' aid? So so killing is a big country. I | 1114.3377910000002 | 1123.217791 |
| SPEAKER_1 | can't No. But that's the thing. That's the point is it. There's no competition. We're all working together. It's all to benefit everybody. You know? There's no comp there's no need to compete. | 1123.217791 | 1134.467791 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Think of it like more in the shop in the in the shopping mall. It's spread over the whole kind of The people who work for the mines who collect ore, those are the works. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So those workers | 1134.6277910000001 | 1152.477791 |
| SPEAKER_1 | in the Sao Paulo, Chile, 1 heat. The markers in the north part of QUE, 1 to eat. 8. Do they then come together and say, oh, we'll call say we sell alcohol for x amount of money. Or is it, hey. You really wanna eat. We we have one of those set up. So I'm not gonna give it for 2 months. Those minds would just be folded together to be be be mock like, to be one | 1118.169666 | 1178.917791 |
| SPEAKER_2 | one group. Right? The minds wouldn't be wouldn't be 2 separate mines. Like, the workers of each mine would collectively own both mines. Right? This is how this is how it works. Otherwise, you're gonna put in direct competition with each other. So it's Marley's makes not strides, but they they already make | 1145.339661 | 1195.487791 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay? | 1165.519661 | 1166.019661 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So they have a they have the work on waste right away. | 1200.547791 | 1202.887791 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Wire from you down to 2 x. The mind's speech. That's where they needed that industry. So instead, what they did is they they instilled violence tools in Chile. Right? They could have gone somewhere else. They didn't. We already know this isn't the case. If they we already know that they they are only gonna get it from one place to them, one place being Right now, that's where they're going for this because of time source. Right? Otherwise, they would have gone and got it from another one. When Chile did this, when, Ayende took power, but they didn't. They violently destroyed the the Okay. You | 1421.733472 | 1461.80347 |
| SPEAKER_1 | know, we would say it's that, but we would say there's no capitalism as a whole. Did you say he's the USA. | 1462.103469 | 1468.603472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Oh my god. Global | 1468.603472 | 1469.563472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | leader | 1469.563472 | 1469.723472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | in | 1469.723472 | 1469.8834749999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | maintaining worldwide capitalism. The USA will destroy any any hint of socialism or communism that he gets whip up because if he doesn't, the USA is at risk. So they maintain top down from worldwide. | 1469.8834749999999 | 1483.423469 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. They're the ones, like why they wouldn't doing most | 1449.615347 | 1486.403472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | of the | 1486.403472 | 1486.563472 |
| SPEAKER_0 | coos and stuff. Right? | 1486.563472 | 1487.783472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Why we went into Venezuela. That's why we went into cub tried to go into Cuba. That's why we went into Honduras. That's why we went into Puerto Rico. That's | 1455.495347 | 1496.4968119999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | why we went into Haiti. Like, there's so many. There's so many that we went | 1496.4968119999999 | 1500.533472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | into | 1500.533472 | 1501.033472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | because we know that if any country is socialist, it's a risk to us. And democracy in the United States as a whole. If the world can see the social | 1467.385347 | 1509.933472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | acceptance | 1509.933472 | 1510.333472 |
| SPEAKER_0 | of the | 1510.333472 | 1510.893472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | means | 1510.893472 | 1511.133468 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of production and not enforce them to their poverty by the working by the owner class. Right? They know workers are gonna rise | 1511.133468 | 1518.573472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | up. | 1518.573472 | 1519.073472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And so they fly to stop that in any way they way, shape, or form that they can. This is all I've stated, by the way. The CIA admits to doing all | 1484.855347 | 1527.063472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | of that. No. No. No. No. I I know I know the document. Yep. Well, there was a bug in the way. Yeah. Yeah. So he knows he's drinking the Solade. Yeah. I understand. How denies the | 1492.755347 | 1540.903472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Kool Aid. Mhmm. | 1540.903472 | 1542.023467 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I mean, | 1542.023467 | 1542.603472 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But they didn't deny | 1510.1653469999999 | 1545.673472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | it. Oh, they're not denying it. He does. He does. But he has. I | 1545.673472 | 1549.723472 |

| SPEAKER_5 | if Eventually, | 1570.063472 | 1570.863472 |
| SPEAKER_0 | they're gonna | 1570.863472 | 1571.633472 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Like, | 1537.325347 | 1537.825347 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Getting | 1538.6853469999999 | 1538.925337 |

| SPEAKER_2 | student? Yeah. | 1573.873462 | 1575.393462 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And or, like, just the what is it the roosters come home to roost? | 1575.393462 | 1580.623472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Right? The USSR imploded from the inside when you | 1549.1553569999999 | 1586.183472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | look | 1586.183472 | 1586.5034719999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | at | 1586.5034719999999 | 1586.583482 |
| SPEAKER_4 | well, | 1586.833482 | 1587.093472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | there's American influence, but their their capitalist revolution came from the inside. From people who wanted to bring in a capitalist market because they wanted control Right? So the US is will help you do that. Right? So, actually, maybe they can do it happen in the | 1552.865347 | 1600.9934819999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | USSR | 1600.9934819999999 | 1601.193472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | USA because the I don't know that the Yeah. The capitalist revolution in the USSR would have would have had the backing that they did had it not been for the USA backing | 1567.125347 | 1608.413472 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Of course. | 1608.573472 | 1609.323472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So I don't know. I | 1575.535347 | 1611.0434719999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | don't know of another We don't don't we take credit for | 1611.0434719999998 | 1612.863472 |
| SPEAKER_6 | all the time? Like, what's the | 1578.6353569999999 | 1613.7434719999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Like, the | 1613.943482 | 1614.223472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | US does, whether you would where they will, like, help any any administration But | 1614.223472 | 1618.7734719999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | if they | 1619.143472 | 1586.105357 |
| SPEAKER_6 | see. It's really funny that, like, how how violent the communist are and stuff like that. Like, how the problem they are and how brutal and how, like, Like, sadly, they treat the people there. But then but then you'll hear them say, | 1620.413482 | 1637.913472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | like, | 1604.9653469999998 | 1605.4653469999998 |
| SPEAKER_6 | you've heard them say, oh, we are much stronger than the than communist Russia or whatever. Like as soon as we got there, they just gave up, like, raise their hands. It's like, wait. So what the fuck? Are they really brutal, like, or not? Like, they didn't even fight | 1606.1353569999999 | 1655.5034719999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you. | 1655.5034719999999 | 1655.833472 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Not to people who are trying to just join the communist way of life. Right? Okay. | 1624.4453469999999 | 1664.093472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | That | 1664.313472 | 1664.473462 |
| SPEAKER_6 | makes no sense. | 1664.473462 | 1665.533472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Social? | 1635.705347 | 1636.205347 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So | 1637.405347 | 1637.805337 |
| SPEAKER_1 | maybe not | 1672.113462 | 1672.673462 |
| SPEAKER_4 | not. | 1672.673462 | 1673.173462 |
| SPEAKER_6 | How's it? It did that yesterday whenever it died. It's, like, echoed at the very end, like, right before it died. | 1642.125347 | 1682.053472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | So it's it's and and it's it's sort of in a different place. Are there no negative speech socialist? | 1682.193452 | 1689.823472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | They're a negative standing system. I'm implying socialism. It's perfect. Right? | 1690.0434719999998 | 1659.915327 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I guess 6:30 ish | 1694.223452 | 1695.423472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | the same you should 7 | 1695.583472 | 1696.563472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | don't | 1662.575347 | 1662.7353469999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | know. Get rid of how terrible | 1697.0434719999998 | 1698.343472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | cap capital I | 1698.563472 | 1699.0434719999998 |
| SPEAKER_6 | don't know. | 1699.0434719999998 | 1699.703492 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You know, there is a golfing system. Right? I wanna look at which system would engage in, like, harm reduction in giving the workers control over the profits that they earn. Probably gonna be less harmful than giving that to 1% of people. | 1671.6753469999999 | 1718.2734719999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Right. | 1685.725347 | 1686.225347 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And How does socialism handle stuff like, hand being handicapped, being unable to work, | 1687.085347 | 1732.603472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | people that can't afford these things. They'll probably be more expensive. | 1708.6753469999999 | 1746.033442 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Because the workers would be the ones | 1712.515347 | 1748.483472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | we'll just do it that | 1724.005347 | 1759.613472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | way. | 1759.673472 | 1760.173472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So | 1730.535347 | 1731.035347 |
| SPEAKER_4 | So so the people paying for obviously, insurance noncompetent. | 1747.4853469999998 | 1753.4253469999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. That | 1754.125347 | 1788.913472 |
| SPEAKER_6 | is actually | 1788.913472 | 1789.553472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | how all in | 1789.553472 | 1790.113472 |
| SPEAKER_6 | 2, | 1790.113472 | 1790.433472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 3. | 1790.433472 | 1790.933472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Wow. | 1758.285347 | 1758.785347 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Oh my | 1761.335347 | 1796.933472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | god. | 1796.933472 | 1797.433472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | But | 1764.755347 | 1764.955347 |
| SPEAKER_3 | what the issue was just expanding that nationally so | 1799.263472 | 1801.463472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that | 1801.463472 | 1801.783472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the pot is bigger. What | 1801.783472 | 1802.743502 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the | 1802.743502 | 1802.923472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the fuck? And you're probably gonna be paying less because you're gonna be cutting off the | 1770.055347 | 1805.963472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | fat | 1805.963472 | 1806.363472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of the middleman. Like, in America, at least, like, 40% of all insurance costs are | 1806.363472 | 1810.453472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | just has | 1810.453472 | 1776.995347 |
| SPEAKER_1 | increased. We cut off the administrative | 1811.463472 | 1813.7434719999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | flow. | 1814.443472 | 1814.5234719999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And immediately it was a bit different. America is spending more for less Right? So clearly, the privatized health care system is working. Spend about 12,000 per person, and we don't get free health care work | 1780.535347 | 1828.413472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | per person. | 1795.065347 | 1829.953492 |
| SPEAKER_1 | At least their health care is free. At least it's free at the point of a point of service. You don't get turned away because you don't have insurance and can't afford the treatment. So so you have to risk it's, going to the ER and spending major ER bill just to get seen for something. Right? So I I just I I would just say, any any industry that is required for people to live, so health care, housing, food, water. I think all 4 of these should be not in America in America specifically, there are 600,000 It's Tiger. It's Tiger. | 1796.045347 | 1898.2434719999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's Tiger. | 1898.623472 | 1899.303472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | How many unoccupied houses there are. In the country? | 1867.385327 | 1905.113492 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I was shot | 1871.095347 | 1906.123472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | in | 1906.123472 | 1906.603472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | the gun. Half shot in the back, quarter of the of the | 1906.603472 | 1910.153472 |
| SPEAKER_5 | mouth? | 1910.153472 | 1910.603472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | There's 16,000,000 unoccupied houses in America. | 1876.455367 | 1913.7934719999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | We can house everybody. | 1881.4253469999999 | 1916.953472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It would take us | 1883.135327 | 1918.733472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | literally nothing. Yep. Since | 1885.065347 | 1922.153472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the | 1922.153472 | 1922.313472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | HUD, the the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Development, only estimates that up to $20,000,000,000 a year. How to end homelessness in America. We spend a trillion on our military | 1922.313472 | 1932.123472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | budget. That's | 1932.123472 | 1899.7353469999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | how business That's a model account. It's | 1934.0434719999998 | 1935.983472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | we don't because housing is a commodity. | 1902.225347 | 1938.533472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The Wall Wall Street owns 41% | 1905.0253469999998 | 1941.353472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | of all housing in America. | 1907.905347 | 1943.513472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Right? Housing is a commodity. There's a profit incentive | 1909.545347 | 1946.7234720000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | to it. So | 1912.415347 | 1947.853472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | nobody has any incentive incentive To get housing away. Right? It because it's on a for profit model. This is why the government is trying to figure out how | 1947.853472 | 1956.123472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | to do it. | 1956.123472 | 1956.873472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And we should remove the for profit element of housing. That way we can give people the people that are unhome Homes. | 1923.385347 | 1931.305347 |
| SPEAKER_4 | But you're talking about giving people homes. | 1936.305307 | 1972.953472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Oh | 1939.085347 | 1939.165347 |
| SPEAKER_1 | my god. Everybody homes. You got a mortgage right now, your mortgage is forgiven. You're paying rent, not no more. Yes. I would give people these homes. | 1973.4734720000001 | 1981.383472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | If we have | 1947.955347 | 1982.903472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the resources to do it, the only reason not to do it is because we wanna generate a profit. | 1982.903472 | 1988.0634719999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | What what | 1953.995307 | 1989.103422 |
| SPEAKER_2 | what | 1989.103422 | 1989.223422 |
| SPEAKER_4 | so it's not a bank for a bank? | 1989.343472 | 1990.963472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Wouldn't that bankrupt bank? | 1957.385347 | 1993.713472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm not | 1993.853472 | 1994.3334719999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | gonna fire | 1994.3334719999998 | 1994.733472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | out. | 1994.733472 | 1994.893472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Mhmm. | 1994.893472 | 1995.393472 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Yeah. | 1961.5253469999998 | 1962.0253469999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | We can work | 1997.673432 | 1998.393472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | all | 1998.393472 | 1998.553432 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that out | 1998.553432 | 1999.033472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | pretty | 1999.033472 | 1999.513472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | easily. | 1999.513472 | 2000.013472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Right? We can make sure sure banks stay above | 1966.055307 | 2002.603422 |
| SPEAKER_4 | water. | 2002.603422 | 2003.103422 |
| SPEAKER_3 | We do it all the time anyway. Anytime a bank fucks up because they | 1970.515387 | 2008.053472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The | 1974.325347 | 1974.365347 |
| SPEAKER_3 | they overdo it when it comes to housing. Bail them out anyway. How about this time when we bail them out, we get something in return? | 1974.765387 | 2016.323472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Right. But yeah. That stuff that they can't pay. We get back. Right? | 1985.125347 | 2025.173472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Again, if we didn't have the resources resources to use it, I probably have a business | 1998.335347 | 2037.413472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | partner. | 2037.713472 | 2038.113472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But | 2038.113472 | 2038.2734719999999 |
| SPEAKER_7 | we have to | 2038.2734719999999 | 2038.803472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | resources necessary to do well. Right? The only reason we | 2004.7353469999998 | 2043.863472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | don't | 2044.0034719999999 | 2044.5034719999999 |
| SPEAKER_6 | What about the banks? Well, | 2010.935317 | 2047.743442 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Should we go back? I mean, I know this is on your on your list. And you probably want to give someone else a call in. Should we go back to a trading economy? Based on solid | 2022.9453469999999 | 2071.123502 |
| SPEAKER_2 | growth? | 2071.123502 | 2071.623502 |
| SPEAKER_1 | As as a as somebody who wants to eventually reach communism, let's do it. I'd I'd be so happy to be done with money. That's what we believe in anyway. | 2073.133512 | 2081.483432 |
| SPEAKER_4 | We believe in it as | 2081.483432 | 2082.3934719999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | stateless, moneyless, classless society when it comes to common So I'm totally fine with us moving back to a barter a trade and barter system. Right? I don't think we need money at at, like, at all. | 2048.245307 | 2092.723472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't even know that we necessarily need trade as much either, but, like, | 2058.415347 | 2095.833472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | yeah, I'm totally fine with that. I have no no issues with us wanting to go back to like, this is what this is what Mark's writes anyway is that we the need | 2062.165347 | 2106.093472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | for | 2106.093472 | 2106.3934719999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | for money in the terms of, like, a state controlled currency won't be needed in a in a communist system. We won't need a state controlled currency. | 2072.6453469999997 | 2114.573472 |

| SPEAKER_3 | racist letter occurred on white Americans | 2287.985347 | 2324.093472 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. So why so what's the most reason why these tickets would not be possible for them to screw the | 2290.265347 | 2331.123472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | because | 2331.523472 | 2331.823472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | racism has to be backed by system | 2297.755347 | 2333.703472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | or, | 2300.275347 | 2300.515347 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Structures | 2301.415297 | 2301.765347 |
| SPEAKER_1 | specifically racist | 2302.595347 | 2338.013472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Outcomes | 2305.745347 | 2306.245347 |
| SPEAKER_1 | against | 2340.723472 | 2341.223472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | different groups. My direct debt reduction that I use is, | 2307.885347 | 2311.705347 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the oppression of 1 racial group for | 2312.575347 | 2348.883472 |
| SPEAKER_8 | the | 2348.883472 | 2349.193472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | political, social, or economic benefit of another social group. And black people Actually, no no rights other than white people in that are able to to do that because the all of the systems that operate in our country are are strictly white supremacists. | 2315.125317 | 2361.613472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | System. So no no no | 2328.265387 | 2364.323472 |
| SPEAKER_8 | 84 | 2331.745347 | 2332.245347 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 2333.155347 | 2333.3953469999997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | guess, base of understanding But, so people can make up the system, and the system slash state is a, corroborate of the people. So if the issue is that | 2367.703472 | 2378.493442 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you have a state that is | 2378.493442 | 2379.6834719999997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | racist, you have to be systematically racist. | 2345.615347 | 2381.863472 |
| SPEAKER_9 | Does it have to be since the system is intrinsically tied to the k. | 2348.165347 | 2351.655347 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Yes. | 2352.745307 | 2352.905347 |
| SPEAKER_9 | Is it just a general societal value rather than a state value or a people value? | 2387.213472 | 2391.453472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. I believe racism has to be systemic. And in order to be a racist, you have to uphold a racist a system of racism. That would be my | 2357.625317 | 2401.733472 |
| SPEAKER_7 | belief. | 2401.733472 | 2402.013472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Countering that with, like, white people and | 2371.835347 | 2408.6434719999997 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Oh my | 2446.375347 | 2481.163472 |
| SPEAKER_9 | god. | 2481.163472 | 2481.663472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | You people? | 2450.025347 | 2485.3934719999997 |
| SPEAKER_8 | She | 2457.3553469999997 | 2457.4353469999996 |
| SPEAKER_5 | said you people | 2491.743472 | 2492.5434720000003 |
| SPEAKER_6 | for sure. Hold on, babe. I didn't I didn't hear | 2492.5434720000003 | 2494.563472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you. I know. From white White. | 2494.563472 | 2496.1101719999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | White. | 2496.1101719999997 | 2496.136872 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Racial group with not a white racial group. | 2496.163472 | 2497.943472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Group. So white supremacy will oftentimes target other white groups to to kinda hide itself. Because at the end of the day, | 2464.035447 | 2505.4334719999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | white cisterncies just pop pop up a capitalist Our | 2505.4334719999997 | 2474.275247 |
| SPEAKER_8 | section? | 2508.583372 | 2509.033472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So right to front see exist to make sure that, | 2475.285447 | 2511.193472 |
| SPEAKER_9 | like, | 2511.193472 | 2511.5434720000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | poor people stay poor and rich, people stay rich. | 2477.475347 | 2513.813472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | If rich white people realize they like, if rich white people realize they can do that, by throwing some white people under the bus they're going to. But the second the structure start to change in any meaningful way, they're going to to bring back in those white people in the | 2479.745347 | 2528.1434719999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | fold. | 2528.1434719999997 | 2528.613472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | To target, | 2494.305347 | 2529.353472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | other minority. So for for an example of this, directly with what you you brought up, the union, the dockworker unions in the early 1900 | 2496.305347 | 2540.023472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | were were were, created with black and Italian people. Right? So or I'm sorry. Irish Americans. | 2506.205347 | 2547.853572 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No Italian Americans. | 2547.853572 | 2548.693472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Sorry. Italian Americans. So black and Italian Americans it probably was Irish Americans as well. So black, in in Irish and Italian Americans started to form docker unions because of the mistreatment. And then the people that | 2514.545447 | 2561.623472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | owned these companies were like, hey. This is bad for us. So what can we do to to kind of stop this? So what they did is said, okay. Well, the Irish and Italian American you guys can form with unions, it will give you a better working condition, but you have to lead the black people in the best we | 2561.623472 | 2543.715347 |
| SPEAKER_3 | are not doing that. | 2578.023472 | 2578.883472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The second they were able to reintegrate back into whiteness they left black Americans in the desk. So this is just how white supremacy operates and it's how it's how it's been able to survive so long is via these kind of shady practices. | 2545.665347 | 2595.873472 |
| SPEAKER_9 | Well, I think that proper white supremacy doesn't include the iron. Doesn't include the Italians. It doesn't include a lot of those ethnic groups. Oh, it's my god. Like polarity. | 2563.1853469999996 | 2607.863472 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It definitely does not. | 2574.665347 | 2610.113472 |
| SPEAKER_8 | Yeah. | 2576.6053469999997 | 2576.945347 |
| SPEAKER_9 | Right. And that's the modernist concept. And this stuff goes with the I'll be at the hand. You buy these ray Done plenty of work Oh my god. And to rectify anything that I could Not maybe a a flavor apologist, but they the long term of American history, you guys aren't the only ones who've been such And just because for a non compliant way, I grew up. You guys have given away, I would have taken it as well. | 2577.1853469999996 | 2639.773472 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What the fuck? | 2606.9052469999997 | 2642.033472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You can say so. I would I | 2609.205347 | 2645.4334719999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | would disagree because we have constant | 2645.4334719999997 | 2646.8934719999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | we have constant evidence of black people not taking an easy an easy way out. Right? Like, you can see this in the film, the in the in the you can see this | 2612.715347 | 2654.5834720000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | in the combination of the of Jewish and black Americans fighting for civil rights. | 2620.515347 | 2658.313472 |
| SPEAKER_1 | They didn't throw each other under the bus. Even when given plenty ample opportunity to. They stuck together to get the civil rights act passed. | 2624.8953469999997 | 2666.563472 |
| SPEAKER_8 | Well, | 2633.455347 | 2633.7553470000003 |

So they can basically just choose like, I don't know what the fucking their shit, like, how they decide which ones. I forgot. But, yeah, basically, they can choose based on relevancy or whatever to decide, if this star rating the rating reflects | 599.154558 | 619.714568 |

Watch videos, like, at 7 x. So it's chaos. For someone that doesn't have familiarity with it, maybe feel old. And I kind of realized it was so important. I was like, it's probably better if I, like, don't really any preparations, so, like, like, in a natural way. But don't don't laugh at me. You're on his side already? Okay.

| SPEAKER_0 | look at what this guy said. And I'm like, mom, this guy tweeted 2 days ago that I was a cut That's why she's watching. I'm kind of more of, like, a | 497.498782 | 504.818783 |

| SPEAKER_1 | that? I'll try that. Yeah. I actually stopped with Simon and because he said he hadn't worked enough for me. So oh, I thought it was because this is awfully hot coffee pot freestyle against rope.

| SPEAKER_1 | Really? | 568.855658 | 569.280658 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Me at all. What | 653.366479 | 654.226479 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I was doing at the time was | 654.226479 | 655.3064790000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | that email, the one up, and cc. In my mind, I'm like, oh, it's like an accountability Not me at all. Like, well, let's go through these write ups. And and then she, like, did you come in So | 655.3064790000001 | 662.3464795 |
| SPEAKER_2 | okay. So then you you were an early adopter of streaming in Twitch. Right? Arguably, the first. Full time job to do streaming. Yeah. So you saw the vision. No. I just carpet cleaning sucked. How did you gain providence or was, like, a funny guy to watch, play video games. Like, I'd, like, say funny things, argue, scream at people, whatever. Like, that was my Yeah. Part of that Cool. The experience. And then how did that how did you correlate that into debates or politics? By the time | 662.386479 | 688.256479 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, rules were trying to make video games. They it was just a whole there was there was probably a legitimate complaint about some girl that had some bad relationship with, like, a reviewer or something. I I think there was there's some, like, element of legitimate complaint there, but it blew up into, like, just the most ridiculous journalist? Yeah. Who reviewed the game, I think. I don't even wanna say that name because I don't know, like, 100% of the details. I don't wanna fuck it up, but the problem is whenever you get a a a movement like that, there's a whole bunch of riffraff that can come in When you're playing a game and, like, You're, like, you're, | 653.408354 | 683.068354 |
| SPEAKER_2 | chatting shit at another guy. Yeah. It becomes, like, kind of embedded in the culture. Is that is that | 683.9983540000001 | 722.766479 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Oh, a little bit. Yeah. Because you don't see each other face to face. You have to ramp up the reality as much as possible. Yeah. So | 722.846479 | 727.996479 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you don't | 727.996479 | 728.3164790000001 |

| SPEAKER_1 | guy. Yeah. From 2016 onwards, especially with Trump, like, every single fucking thing in life is, like, political hardcore now. Like, all of the culture was kind of moving more, wanna say woke, because that makes it sound bad, but, like, to be more inclusive and stuff. So, like, Black Panther came out and we're like, oh my god. Black superhero Yeah. Marvel movie. And Anita Sarkeesian and, yeah, women in game And I mean, some people just had a lot of opinions about Anne. | 697.4983540000001 | 753.676479 |

| SPEAKER_2 | heavily, like, | 794.256479 | 795.1964790000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | White. Just because it's, like, tech and politics and shit. And they're watching 10 hours a day. No. Probably not all of them. Not most of them. But they are watching probably for like an hour or 2, which is a lot to consider. With a person. Yeah. | 761.1283540000001 | 805.686469 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Do you think it's a good have you ever has a woman ever watched you, like, winning a debate and just become, like, you notice that her in the | 777.2783440000001 | 818.736479 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, this is dating and, | 818.8164790000001 | 819.936479 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, | 819.936479 | 820.176479 |
| SPEAKER_1 | fucking chicks? Isn't that all kind of, like, a debate? Is that what you're doing when you go to dinner? You're trying to make the best argument for why? They can't win? | 820.176479 | 827.526479 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Do you debate women? We all debate women. Life is a big debate against women. It's not fair. Is it No, dude. What happens is is you're winning, and then they cry, and then you instantly lost. It's not fair. It's fucking cheating. Uh-huh. Even if you're if if demolishing them with facts and logic. Is there one moment that you're, like, you feel it is a crowning achievement? Do do you think that that was my biggest dub? Or Like, | 827.526479 | 820.948354 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, like, different debates feel good, I guess, for different reasons. So, like, there are debates that are big. Give you a lot of popularity or notoriety. They're a device that I, like, prepared very heavily for. And I feel like I do good, but they might not be as popular. So I guess it just depends. What feels like satisfying for you while you're it? | 821.108354 | 838.9983540000001 |

They account for everything in the study. They account for time of day. Account for type of car. They account for whether or not a ticket was issued. They account for all of these things in the study. The study shows that there is a racial bias in the police system, especially when it comes to, police stops. There if you are white, you have a specific privilege in which you are not being, racial profiled | 226.21999999999997 | 256.2 |
| SPEAKER_3 | by the police. | 290.508125 | 291.788125 |

| SPEAKER_2 | is it | 293.948125 | 294.198125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | in | 263.96 | 264.04001999999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | general? Which one? Get pulled over more during the daytime. So when it becomes nighttime, it evens out. Accounts for that. I don't know if you heard me when I said that it accounts for all of this. 2nd, of all, it when it comes to nighttime, what they do is | 298.348145 | 316.54812499999997 |
| SPEAKER_3 | they take places where it becomes nighttime at around the same around different times of the year. So for instance, I don't know if you know what daylight saving time is. But sometimes we get nighttime at 5 o'clock at night. Some it becomes night at, like, 7 o'clock at night. So they will have it, and they don't, like, bring the | 316.54812499999997 | 332.528125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Because you | 298.21999999999997 | 333.44812499999995 |

I make money doing something I like if you hate your job. That's a thing that you need to reconcile within yourself. So again, so again, so again, talking about the study, because I have been able to pull up evidence for the claims that I make. Right? Which is here is evidence So when it comes to pullover rates, what they did is they look at a specific place and they look at the pullover rates during the time of year when it's nighttime and the time of year when it's daytime. Typically, when it's 5 PM, the same people are going to be driving these roads because they're coming home From what? So they're looking at the time of day then and analyzing the differences between when it's daytime and when it's nighttime. And you know | 339.45812500000005 | 387.674825 |
| SPEAKER_4 | what | 387.674825 | 387.87562499999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | they found out, Eric? I'll tell you what they found | 387.87562499999996 | 389.88396500000005 |
| SPEAKER_3 | out because I'm sure you're attention. They found out that black people get pulled over more when it's daytime, and the pullover rates even out when it's nighttime. | 389.88396500000005 | 399.46812500000004 |

| SPEAKER_0 | No no no tickets. No traffic impact. If you want to look at the entire culmination of data from the 95,000,000 stops, you can do that. But the overall I'm sorry. Are you not listening? Or You have the information. I'm asking you Are you are you not listening? Or if you want to look at the entirety of the data, you can. The overarching, points from the data stop is that typically black people are about 16 times more likely to be over than white people even when there is no infraction happening. So | 431.577892 | 466.447892 |
| SPEAKER_1 | tables. Go look at the data tables. So so if I'm black, I'm 16 times more likely to pollute for no reason. Based on that study, And you were saying that the, the work times, they drive home from work? Well, most black people don't work. Are you you you have, like, a safe job. | 430.83976700000005 | 493.03789200000006 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Hello? Doing, motherfody? | 0 | 35.788144999999986 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Of controlling these patterns and living according to scientific pattern. Of choosing food between birds and eagles. All this seems opposed to the secret influences. The mobilizations of myths, to slip the field to be irrational, so characteristic of propaganda. But this development within the democratic framework can be understood clearly if we look at it not from the level of principles but from that of actual situation, If so far, you have concluded inside a democracy propaganda is normal and indispensable. Even if in the regime, nothing seems to make propaganda obligatory in external relation. There, the situation is entirely different. There, the democratic state will want to present itself as the carrier of its entire public opinion. And the democratic nation will want to present itself as a coherent whole. But that creates some difficulty because such desire does not correspond to a true and exact picture of democracy. Moreover, this implies an endemic permanent state of war. But, Lorenzen, it is easy to show that permanent wars established themselves at the same time as democratic regimes. It is even easier to demonstrate that these regimes express a strong desire for peace and do not systematically prepare for war. Possibly provoke general conflicts. But that the regime such as it is is not organically timed. It is Bowland's nobles. And it adjusts poorly to the situation of the cold war which is essentially psychological. Another circumstance in prison's democracy in the ways of propaganda the persistence of some traits of the democratic ideology. The conviction of the invincible force of truth is tied to the notion of progress and is a part of this ideology. Democracies have been fed on the notion that truth may be hidden for a while. But will triumph in the end. The troops in itself carries an explosive force. The power of fermentation that will necessarily lead to the end of lies the shining operation of the truth. This truth was the implicit core of the democratic government. One must stress furthermore that this was in itself a truth of an ideological conflict ended by making history because it imposed itself on history. This attitude contained the seeds of but was at the same time and still is, the exact opposite of current Marxist attitude that this one is true. Proof through history is nowadays regarded as He in whose favor history decides Was right. But what is to being right? One speaks of history, it is to win. To survive. That is to be the strongest. This would mean that the strongest and most efficient now and then is the possessor of the truth. Truth does has no content of its own. But it just only as history produces it. Truth receives reality through history. One can easily see the relationship between the two attitudes and how one can pass easily from one to the other. For if truth possesses an invincible power that makes it triumph, itself upon. It becomes logical. By a simple but dangerous step. That triumph is true. But and this is frightening. The consequences of the 2 attitudes are radically different. To think that democracy must triumph because it is the truth, leads me to be democratic. Between the democratic regime as opposed to regimes of oppression, its superiority will declare at first some to the infallible judgment of man and his The choices are certain. What amaze me is displayed again and again by Democrats, particularly in Democrats, When they see that a man selects something else, and the history is indecisive, In such cases, they decided to use information Because democratic reality was not known, people have made a bad Short. And even there, we find the same conviction of the power of truth. But it is not born out of thought fact. We will not establish a general law here. Sure. But we will say that it is not a general law. The truth triumphs automatically. Though it may in certain periods of history ignore with respect to certain verities. We do not generalize here at all. History shows that plain truth can be so thoroughly snuffed out that it disappears. And that in certain periods, the law is all powerful. | 8.069979906082153 | 320.9081249060822 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Even | 287.7300000190735 | 287.9700000190735 |
| SPEAKER_1 | when truth triumphs, there's a triumph to itself because of its truth? After all, the eternal barriers defended by an integrity were in the eyes of history have yielded to Creon even if Sophocles had not exited. But in our time, the conviction of democracy and its claim to inform people collide with the fact that propaganda follows an entirely different performs a function entirely different from that information. And the knowledge base stops to not assume reality in the people's eyes unless they are established by propaganda. Propaganda, in fact, creates truth in the sense that it creates a main subject all the signs and indications of true believers. From other men, propaganda is really creating This means that fruit is powerless without propaganda. And in view of the challenge the democracies face, it means that supreme importance that they abandon their confidence in truth this such and similar themselves to the methods of propagation. Unless they do so, considering the present tendency of civilization, the democratic nations will lose the war conducted in this area. Democratic propaganda Convinced of the necessity for using the means of propaganda. Students of that question have found themselves facing the following problem. Totalitarian states have used propagandism to dominate. Domestically in order to create conformity and make for their public opinion and adjusted to the decisions of the government. Externally, conduct the comb board. Undermine the public opinion of nations considered enemies, and turned them into living victims. Beneath these instruments were used principally by authoritarian states. And with democracies whose structures seemed made for their means did not use them, can they help the use of our democracies? By that, I mean, that the propaganda of the authoritarium special would seem inseparable from that state. Must democratic propaganda have other traits? Is it possible to make democratic propaganda? Let us quickly dismiss the idea that a simple difference in content would mean a difference in character. From the moment that propaganda is used to promulgate democratic ideas, it is good. If it is bad, it is only because of its authoritarian content. Such a position is terribly idealistic and the principal condition of the modern world. The promise of means wherein But what they say, and this is a matter worthy of reflection, that democracy itself is not a good propaganda object. Not to bring all propaganda efforts to promulgate democracy have failed. In fact, one would have to modify the entire concept of democracy considerably make it a good propaganda object. Would be present if he was not. Also in person, will mention the following thought. The love that democracy uses this instrument, propaganda, Propaganda becomes democratic. This thought is not often expressed quite so simply and aggressively. But it is an implicit notion found in most American writers. Nothing can touch democracy. On the contrary, it impresses its character on everything it touches. This prejudice is important for understanding the American Democratic mythology. And the tentative adoption of this principle by other popular democrats. Such positions are so superficial and so remote from the actual situation They do not need any besides. Besides, they usually come from journalists However, retain the conviction that one can set up a proper propaganda system that exposes the democratic character. And does not alter the working of democracy. That is a double demand that one must make for propaganda. Democratic machine. Is argued that the first condition would be met by the absence of a monopoly and a democracy in And by the free interplay of various propagandists. True compared with the state monopoly and the unity of propaganda into totalitarian states, One finds a great diversity of press and radio in democratic countries. But this fact must not be stressed Too much. Although there is no state of big or monopoly, there is, nevertheless, indeed a private monopoly. Even when there are many newspaper publishers, concentration as a result of newspaper changes is well established. And the monopolization of news agencies of distribution and so on is well known. In the field of radio or a motion pictures, the same situation prevails. Obviously, not everybody can own propaganda here. In the United States, most video and motion picture corporations are very large. The others are secondary and unable to compete, and centralization still go on. It trained everywhere. This is the direction of a very few very powerful companies who control all the propaganda in India. In any event, as you have already seen, the state must make its propaganda. If only under the aspect of disseminating the need. Assuming that information is an in this what It is necessary that the information promulgated by the state be credible. Without credibility, it will fail. But what happens when a powerful private propaganda organization is not that some force advised information who can tell where truth lies. On whom can the citizen rely to judge the debate? It is on this level that the dialogue really takes place. The problem then is whether the state will support a private competitor who controls neither equal or superior to its own. That makes different propaganda. It may even be entirely legitimate for the state to suppress or annex, such Some will say freedom of expression is democracy. To prevent propaganda is to violate democracy. Certainly. But it must be remembered that the freedom of expression of 1 or 2 powerful companies that do not express the thoughts of individuals or small groups that have capitalist interests or an entire public, does not exactly corresponds to what was called freedom of essentially a bill. Is not the same instead of the speaker who has all the radio set in the country at his disposal. All the more, as the science of propaganda gives to these instruments, their shock effect had been non initiated. And are equal. I refer to the excellent study by Rivera who demonstrates the immense difference between the 19th and 20th centuries in this respect. Technique In In the 19th century, the problem of opinion formation through the expression of thought was essentially a problem of contacts between the state and the individual. And the problem of acquisition of a freedom. But today, thanks to the mass media, the individual finds himself outside the The debate is between the state and powerful groups. Freedom to express our ears is no longer at stake in this debate. What we have is mastery and domination by the state. Or by some powerful groups over the whole of the technical media of the famous formation. The individual has no access to them. Is the stake. What matters for him is which voice he will be permitted to hear. And which words will have the power to obsess in. It is in the light of this perfect analysis that one must ask oneself what freedom of expression still means in a democracy. But even if the state held old and instrumental propaganda, that has become increasingly common for political particularly so far as GE is concerned, in France. What terrorizing democracy is that it commits the expression of difference This is true. But it is impossible to permit the expression of all opinion. The immoral and aberrant opinions are justifiably subject to censorship. Purely personal opinions, and an even more certain political are necessarily excluded. No freedom for the enemies of freedom. Is a watchword then. Thus, the democracies create for themselves a problem of limitation and degree. Greeting will exclude certain propaganda instruments. For the fascists, the communists, and the enemy is in truth. The communists, the enemies of freedom by the bourgeois, the fascist, the fascist, the communist, and for the democracy obviously, all elements of democracy. Now there's an even more serious In time of war, everybody agrees that news must be limited and controlled. From that fact goes a unified propaganda. The problem that now arises is this. We have talked at the Cold War. But it seems that the democracies have not yet learned that the cold war is no longer an exceptional state. A state analogous to hot war. Is transitory. But is becoming a permanent and endemic state. There are many reasons for that. I will name only one. Propaganda itself. Propaganda directed the territories outside one's border is a weapon of war. This does not depend on the will of those who use it or on a doctrine, but as a result of the medium itself. Hopaganda has such an ability to affect psychological transformations and such an impact on the very core of man. That it inevitably has military force. Used by government and directed to the outside. There is no simple use of propaganda. A propaganda conflict is hardly less serious than an armed conflict. It is inevitable, therefore, that in a cold war, the same attitude says in the case of hot war. One feels they need to unify propaganda. Their democracies are called inner vicious circle from which they seem unable to escape. The other principal aspect of democratic propaganda is that it is subject to certain guidelines. It is not unfettered. It is an instrument not of passion but of reason. Footnote, by the separation of powers and so on. See, for example, titans in 20th century propaganda. By Ernest Chris and Nathan Leitisch who contrasted the appeal to the superego and to the irrational, by authoritarian propaganda with democratic propaganda. Which is directed at the ego. Therefore, democratic propaganda must be essentially truthful. It must speak only to truth and base itself only on facts. This can be observed in American propaganda. It is undeniable that American information and propaganda are truthful. But that does not seem to mean characteristic of democracy. The formula with which Americans explained their attitude is improved That is propaganda based on truth is more effective than any other. Besides, statement of a lie is not a typical trade of propaganda. There is an unmistakable evolution here. Lies and falsifications and useless and blessed. We have already said that. The use of precise facts is becoming increasingly common. Conversely, the use of nuances and a certain set of reveals an attitude to democracy. At bottom, there is a certain respect for the human being, unconscious would have becoming steadily weaker, but nevertheless still there. Even the most nontheologian, the Democrats respect the conscience of his listener. And does not treat him the case to contempt. The tradition of respecting the individual has not yet been eliminated. And this leads to all sorts of consequences. First, it limits stop again. The democratic state uses propaganda only if driven by circumstance. For example, traditionally, afterwards. But whereas private and domestic propaganda is persistent in its effect. Governmental and external propaganda evaporate. It's a such propaganda is not total. Does not seek to envelop all of human life, to control every form of behavior. To attach itself ultimately to one's A third trait of democratic propaganda is that it looks at both sides of the The Democratic advocacy is frequently close to that of his university. There is no absolute truth, and it is acknowledged that the opponent has some Some justice, some reason on his side. Question of nuance. There is no strict rule except in time before about good on one side and bad on the other. Finally, the democratic cop again or democratic state will often have a bad conscience about using propaganda. The old democratic conscience still gets in the way of burdensome. He has delayed even Thus, for the propaganda center democracy, he felt himself fully into the task. It is necessary that he leave Russia has seen still another difference between democratic and totalitarian distinguishing between contrasted incitement and The first consists of a senior of a sunburst by the instrument authorities in order to produce in the masses and in fact, in which those in power do not participate. This, according to last week, is the customary method of Conversely, the positive and excitement symbolizing the extended brotherly and a stimulus that springs from part the powers that the really feel. In which they want to make the masses participate. It is a communal action. This analysis is roughly accurate. All this represents the situation in which democracies find themselves in the face of propaganda. And indicates the differences between democratic and authoritarian propaganda method. And I must now render a very serious judgment on such activity. Democratic propaganda, All that I have to slide down is a truth ineffectual propaganda. Precisely, to the extent that the propagandist retains this respect for the individual? He denies himself the very penetration that is the ultimate aim of all propaganda. That are provoking action without prior thought. By the setting nuances, he reflects the major law of propaganda. And the assertion must be trenching into total To the extent that he remains partial, he fails to use the misty. The belle mystique is indispensable for well made propaganda. To the extent that the democratic propagandist has a bad conscience and cannot do good work, nor can he, but he believes in his own propaganda. As concerns last well's distinction, the technique of propaganda demands one form depending on circumstances. In any event, propaganda always creates a schism between the government That same schism I have described in the book, The Technological Society, and that is provoked by all the techniques. These practitioners come to see the sole they can see the technicians. And to modify the structures of the state. According to Lasseo's analysis, propaganda based on contrast of incitation expresses a despotism. I would rather say that it expresses an irresoftness. But the famous massive democracy corresponds to that. Is that ultimately, even if one tries to maintain calm confidence and communion between the government and the government, All propaganda ends up as a means like which the prevailing powers manipulate the masses. The true propagandist must be as cold lucid, and rigorous as a surgeon. There are subjects and objects. The propaganda team needs in pushing and lets himself become a victim of his own gain. He'll have the same weakness as a surgeon who operates on a loved one. Or a judge who presides at a trial of a member of his own family. To use the instrument of propaganda nowadays, one must have a scientific approach. The lack of proof was the Clearly, after 1943, one could see from its contents that governments had begun to be needed. So some of the market's fundamental aspects paralyzed the convo of propaganda. There is, therefore, no democratic propaganda. Propaganda made by the democracy seems ineffective. Various propagandists are permitted to express themselves, they become ineffective with respect to their immediate objective. This in effect of this was regarded as a citizen to the Let us nearly emphasize here that our copy agenda is out classed by that of totalitarian states. This means that ours does not do its job. But in view of the challenging place, it is imperative that ours need effective. 1 must therefore abandon the traits that are characteristic of democracy but paralyzing for propaganda. The combination of effective propaganda and respect for the individual seems impossible. There is a last element, contractual mention briefly. Jacques, demonstrated that propaganda is totalitarian in its essence. Not because it is the handmaid of the totalitarian city. But because it has a tendency to absorb everything. This finding is the best part of this work. Paris, a Cola, 1950. It means that when one takes that move, one cannot stop One must accept and developments over the past 1000 years show it. That the democracies will abandon their precautions and their new launches in the hardly into effective propaganda action. But such action will no longer have a special democratic character. We must know it's only the effect that the making of propaganda has on democracy. To measure that, we must distinguish between external and domestic. We must not retain the illusion that propaganda is merely a neutral instrument that one can use without being effective. It is comparable to radium. And what happens to the radiologists?

| SPEAKER_2 | UnitedHealthcare | 2815.8883249759674 | 2815.9281249759674 |
| SPEAKER_5 | He was just talking about how people | 2816.408124923706 | 2818.6481249237063 |

| SPEAKER_4 | are | 2818.648124933243 | 2819.068124933243 |
| SPEAKER_9 | know. United's weren't there. It was as if they already knew they away with about $20. There was a single paragraph about it in a local newspaper. That's it. The murderers were never caught. The police did not seem to care all that much. Who | 2821.788125038147 | 2806.770000038147 |
| SPEAKER_4 | is this he's talking | 2841.078125 | 2842.198125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | about? | 2842.198124885559 | 2842.5281248855595 |
| SPEAKER_9 | The media tries the pandemics and some tries | 2850.6500000953674 | 2887.9881250953676 |
| SPEAKER_9 | partisan politics. But that does not seem to work. | 2855.019900083542 | 2893.088125083542 |
| SPEAKER_7 | bit. | 2884.1781249046326 | 2884.5581249046327 |
| SPEAKER_3 | But some | 2888.2381250858307 | 2888.9281250858303 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Now there was one thing | 2893.708125114441 | 2894.828125114441 |
| SPEAKER_9 | political affiliation. It was a unification of sentiments that I had not | 2895.960000038147 | 2934.948125038147 |
| SPEAKER_7 | seen | 2900.880000114441 | 2901.380000114441 |
| SPEAKER_9 | that took 3,000 lives What if you were deaf at a similar reaction? | 2907.7200000286102 | 2914.08000002861 |
| SPEAKER_7 | I | 2927.579999923706 | 2927.7399999237064 |
| SPEAKER_9 | try to believe that a society | 2934.680000066757 | 2970.268125066757 |
| SPEAKER_0 | since | 2936.468125104904 | 2936.968125104904 |
| SPEAKER_7 | the | 2937.0281250476837 | 2937.5281250476837 |
| SPEAKER_4 | That's | 2948.7681250572205 | 2949.0881250572206 |
| SPEAKER_7 | a | 2949.0881249904633 | 2949.248124990463 |
| SPEAKER_10 | hell of a thing, | 2949.248125076294 | 2949.888125076294 |
| SPEAKER_9 | isn't it? Imagine millions of people either celebrating your death or at the very least, not minding | 2949.8881249427795 | 2958.8683249427795 |
| SPEAKER_5 | it? It's a | 2959.088224887848 | 2959.9681248878483 |
| SPEAKER_9 | scary | 2959.968125104904 | 2960.468125104904 |
| SPEAKER_4 | thought. | 2960.8482251167297 | 2961.2481251167296 |
| SPEAKER_9 | would imagine that it's at least disconcerting for the PSG of that CEO, especially as | 2962.0481250286102 | 2968.22812502861 |
| SPEAKER_7 | they | 2968.2281250953674 | 2968.7281250953674 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Mhmm. | 2970.508125066757 | 2970.908125066757 |
| SPEAKER_7 | She feared for this | 2970.948124885559 | 2971.7881248855592 |
| SPEAKER_9 | killer. A society that is more heavily wrong message, which will be the status quo. Plus more security. To the views of that CEO, but I'd much rather see you And I want that to be the reason that you are no longer in Danger. It wasn't like the CEO was a well known man, not like Osama bin Laden was. We all know that the vast majority of people who cheer for | 2971.788125038147 | 3022.838125038147 |
| SPEAKER_9 | No. No. | 2996.539999961853 | 2997.2799999618533 |
| SPEAKER_9 | Workouts. And that's all they need to know. So it's not even | 3004.3499999046326 | 3043.508124904633 |
| SPEAKER_9 | Every | 3021.9800000190735 | 3022.3001000190734 |
| SPEAKER_2 | his See, they kept doing | 3022.8381249904633 | 3024.118124990463 |
| SPEAKER_5 | that. Oh, okay. Well, I felt like he, like, stretched his out real quick and just, | 3024.118124961853 | 3027.7981249618533 |
| SPEAKER_9 | When your chosen perfection affects | 3024.890000104904 | 3061.3581251049045 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, | 3027.7981250286102 | 3028.2981250286102 |
| SPEAKER_5 | smack you. Have been though. | 3028.438124895096 | 3029.0781248950957 |
| SPEAKER_9 | of ethical behavior impossible. | 3028.780100107193 | 3074.678125107193 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. | 3029.078125 | 3029.578125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And then I still fucking cut | 3031.5881249904633 | 3032.868124990463 |
| SPEAKER_5 | it too close. Yeah. True. There's a combination, but for yeah. I saw that. I had clicked. | 3032.868124961853 | 3037.5281249618533 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. | 3037.668324947357 | 3038.168324947357 |
| SPEAKER_4 | about recycled Dutch food and mushrooms and a new fucking potato. Mhmm. | 3043.508125066757 | 3015.790100066757 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Mhmm. | 3043.859999895096 | 3044.359999895096 |
| SPEAKER_9 | And the mere act of doing it becomes an indictment. | 3044.519900083542 | 3082.9281250835415 |
| SPEAKER_4 | day. Oh, fuck. What the fuck? | 3056.608225107193 | 3058.148325107193 |
| SPEAKER_10 | the | 3061.3581249713898 | 3061.5181249713896 |
| SPEAKER_2 | lie, | 3061.5181250572205 | 3061.8081250572204 |
| SPEAKER_1 | 1 | 3063.380000114441 | 3063.860000114441 |
| SPEAKER_9 | but merely because it's part of | 3065.2200000286102 | 3069.33000002861 |
| SPEAKER_4 | So with the Nazis so much more. | 3072.670000076294 | 3108.918125076294 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Well? | 3076.3001000881195 | 3076.8001000881195 |
| SPEAKER_7 | I don't | 3080.710000038147 | 3115.258125038147 |
| SPEAKER_2 | but this | 3092.9400000572205 | 3127.8080250572207 |
| SPEAKER_5 | rich people and the news people, they're all like, he was just doing his job, and he didn't have to be murdered. Don't go fuck it. I | 3096.609999895096 | 3137.293124895096 |
| SPEAKER_9 | overseers of pain, suffering, and death. Some do it because of hatred. All others do it for profit. Mhmm. It's nothing personal to them. But, of course, to you, it's the most personal it can be. It's your life. | 3110.4000000953674 | 3160.1383250953672 |
| SPEAKER_3 | know if we're | 3115.258125066757 | 3116.078125066757 |
| SPEAKER_5 | if we were making excuses. Those same excuses for them, though. So yeah. Right? | 3116.218125104904 | 3120.218125104904 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I guess. | 3120.218125104904 | 3120.878125104904 |
| SPEAKER_5 | But you know how we've demonized the Nazis over here. | 3121.0181250572205 | 3124.0281250572207 |
| SPEAKER_7 | But | 3124.7281250953674 | 3125.2281250953674 |
| SPEAKER_9 | In the end, though, matter how someone dies, the fact that they die carries an impact. And that works both ways. 10 days after the UnitedHealthcare CE was killed, the billionaire founder of the Mango Fashion | 3126.930000066757 | 3178.778125066757 |

| SPEAKER_9 | Yes. Did these commenters know that man? Did they wake up feeling wrong before that day? Probably not. What he did do however, was accumulate 1,000,000,000 of dollars during a time when many of us are struggling. That's what those who did not care about his death | 3155.859999895096 | 3184.8859998950957 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Mhmm. | 3160.1383249759674 | 3160.6383249759674 |

I tried to tell you that. Before, but but the same thing about the time we'll be doing. Identifying as a square thing. I mean, you say it a lot, but then when you said that, it even disguised itself.

| SPEAKER_1 | And being separated from the world. Itself. For its discontinuation would ask too great a sacrifice of the propaganda deed. A 2 0 limit is at himself. But we realized the propaganda can and does produce contradictory psychological results. This has been made clear but should be We shall therefore examine 4 examples of these contradictory effects. Aside from the fact already studied, it propaganda satisfies certain needs while arousing others. Can simultaneously create some tension to these others. We have shown how it was responds to the need of the individual in our society. Who lives in an unhealthy state of anxiety. I would consults the individual helps him decide his conflict. But it must not be forgotten that it also creates an anxiety and provokes tensions. Particularly after a propaganda of fear or terror the listener is less unstable emotional tension which cannot be resolved by kind words or suggestion. Only actions can resolve the time for future, or who will be questioning Zion and reduced capacity in case he cannot stand discord in opposition. A propagandist must try to find the optimum degree of tension in their side. This rule was expressed in the letters by the elders. Therefore, one thing I saw the patient with an accidental psychological effect very, and then cause the death. Too little tension does not push people to life. They remain complacent and seek to adapt themselves passively. It is therefore necessary to reinforce any challenge in some case. For example, concerning the effect of a military defeat. In others, to reduce tensions, they become too strong for people to handle by themselves. For example, the fear of air brake. The ambivalence of propaganda of creating tension in some cases and reducing it others explains itself largely, it seems to lie, by the propaganda and integration propaganda. The first would change the graphic file and caption must arouse feelings of frustration, conflict, and aggression. Which lead individuals to action. The latter did 6 men's conforming with his group. Including participation in action, relaying with the reduction of tension. Adjustment to the environment, acceptance of the symbols of authority. Moreover, the two factors can overlap. For example, a revolution Nazi party will employ propaganda of tension with respect to things outside the party. Propaganda of acceptance with respect to the party itself. This explains the attitude of universal acceptance of all that is said or done in the party. And the opposite attitude of universal challenge and rejection of everything outside it. And even with this as the second contradiction of which propaganda creates self justification and the good conscience, and at the same time, guilt free comes into bad conscience. We have seen the strength of propaganda develop from a furnace the individual a freedom of security and righteousness. Propaganda also stimulates guilt feelings. In fact, to develop said feelings is it possible to adjust of his own cause, his country, his army, and his group. For the man who feels guilty loses his effectiveness and his desire to fight. To convince a man that those on his side, if not he himself, commit immoral and unjust acts is to bring on the disintegration of the group to which he propaganda can be made against the government, the army, the country's war aims, even the values that underpinned by individuals. Bad conscience in this way. Strange as everything. Probably because of its passion with the In many event, propaganda creates a conscience among its partisans in the in 1935 in 1935, and even more so at the beginning of 1957, Sustained by campaigns on torture, colonialism, and the injustice of the French colony. This is characteristic of the French. This scene created by propaganda Absolutely, partially legitimate. So it's the essential cause of the division of the FLN. A purely psychological victory confirming the candidates and conclusions of mine. Third conclusion. In certain cases, propaganda is an agent of a caption to the group. Posthuman. | 0 | 400.12 |

Eviscerical, perf, mediocre, Propaganda must always fight against privatization, the feeling that needs man to consider his private affairs and is most important and produces skepticism toward the activities of his state. The owner may ideology, such as was right in Germany after 1945. The conviction that all is useless. It evoke means nothing. That it's not worthwhile to die for god's sake. Propaganda has absolutely no effect on those who live in such indifference of skepticism. | 619.898125 | 653.248125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Mhmm. One of | 620.2499000000001 | 655.198025 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the great differences between propaganda before and after 19 40 was that in Western countries, the latter had to face skeptical and privatized individuals. A modern state can function only with the citizen's digital security, and that's the can be obtained only if prioritization is erased. If propaganda succeeds in politicizing all questions, in arousing individual passions for political problems, | 655.198025 | 679.468225 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Same time, injustice, propaganda is an agent sir, of the regime. It produces this effect sometimes without intention to, sometimes deliberately, This reaction of hybridization occurs in the phenomena of the goal and skepticism when 2 opposing propagandists work on the same group with almost equal force. Then the privatization of that is involved in the. But in many cases, propaganda deliberately seeks to produce privatization. For example, a propaganda of terror seeks to create a depressing effect on the opponent, and leads him to adopt a fatalistic attitude. Footnote, the terrorist action of the OAS in 1960 2 was at risk. Nothing helps. That the opposing party or army is so strong that no resistance is possible. In this connection, the appeal to the value of private life is used. The feeling is aroused that one risks the death which has no meaning. The decisive argument of privatization, propaganda. Such arguments are useful for paralyzing the memory. They can give up the struggle and withdraw into egoism. They are equally valid in political or military conflict. One aspect of privatization propaganda by the state seems us even more important. When it creates a situation not His propaganda that neutralizes and paralyzes its his opinion. By reiterating a simple set of truths such as that the Egyptian scientists' political power is very participation in political controversy in the industry So what good business do? Why don't you Individuals receive their comfort because condensation is a spontaneous reaction of individual vendors eyes by reaction to criticism. But it is propaganda which sustains his attitude of privatization and skepticism, leaving to the government complete freedom to us as it thinks proper. The reasonable appeal of such propaganda will be defeated I read Because in general, man does not like to assume responsibility. It is enough to remember the sigh of relief that went through all the friends in 18 50 2. And again in 1958 when the similar authoritarian state paid Frenchman's opinion that they would no longer have to make decisions for themselves. But these would now be made for them by others. Thus to save in various ways by terror in the English journey. By political education in the Soviet Union, neutralizes the masses. Forces them into facility, chose them back on their private life in personal happiness. Actually, according to some necessary satisfactions on this level, In order to leave a free hand to those who are intolerant, in the astro, to the new earth, This method offers very great advantages.

| SPEAKER_1 | Ideology. The traditional relationship. A relationship between propaganda and ideology has always existed. The pattern of that relationship became | 889.4900000000001 | 936.228125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | more or less a style | 936.228125 | 937.0681250000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | before the end of 19th century. I will not give here an original or a specific definition of ideology, but will merely say that society rests on certain people beliefs since no social group can exist without such beliefs. To the extent that members of the group attribute intellectual malidity to these disease, one may speak of an ideology. One might also consider a different process by which ideology is formed. Ideologies emerge for adopting to degrade and vulgarize. And for that element of beauty, enters England. However that may be, it has long been known that some ideologies are compatible with but most of them are active. That is a cushion into action. Moreover, to the extent that members of a group may be their ideology to represent the truth, they almost always assume an aggressive posture in try to impose that ideology elsewhere. In such cases, ideology becomes bent on conquest. The drive toward conquest may arise within the society as a conflict between groups. For example, the proletarian ideology versus others within the nation. Or can you make targets outside? A national of Cardiology will? The expansion of an ideology can take various forms. It can accompany the expansion of a group and imposes itself on collectivities being embraced by the group. As with the Republican ideology of 1793, or the communist ideology of 1940 5, which accompanied the | 903.4001 | 1028.908125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | army. | 1028.9681249999999 | 1029.4681249999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | An ideology such as that of labor and a bourgeoisie. May extend by its own momentum on a purely psychological plan. In this case, the ideology assumes nonmaterial starting too. Meanwhile, penetrates the group that represents such an In this fashion, the ideology of labor helps bring about the bourgeois orientation of all Western societies even. | 996.0500000000001 | 1053.018125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Finally, an | 1019.4900000000001 | 1055.2381249999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | ideology can expand by certain other means. Without force and without setting an entire group in motion. At that point, we find propaganda. I Propaganda appears spontaneously or in organized fashion. As a means of spreading an ideology beyond the borders of a group. Or fortifying it within a group. However, in the White House, police's propaganda is directly inspired by ideology in both It is equally evident that what house here is to spread the content of that ideology. Republican does not need a lie So that in the course of history, you find This work in process is a relatively simple and there there's no Lenin and Hitler found the world in which the process great innovation, you must understand that the modern world is essentially a world all the means at Manav's disposal and that aims and means that they can protection of | 1055.2381249999999 | 1170.7781250000003 |

| SPEAKER_1 | All in many cases, are more important than all. That is what and on the other to dig the doctrine itself a level of importance secondary to us With Hitler, one part precisely is the same point. There was 2 different things. First of all, a total In most cases, such former and customary aspects of the ideology as it images and vocabulary. He's been modifying national social studies diodesiology several times according to the requirements of comprehensive. Best is known when establishing Moreover, the claim launched by Raymond and Hitler touched on all prevailing ideologies, all of which now exist in connection with much each or not. It was no longer possible to turn back. Only adjustments The new relationship These new propaganda methods has consistently changed the relationship between propaganda and ideology. And as a result, the role and value of ideologies in the present world. Have | 1154.5500000000002 | 1347.71 |
| SPEAKER_4 | changed. | 1382.018125 | 1382.518125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Propaganda's task is less and less than propagated ideology. Knowledge. It's an old being have its own balls since it becomes a common. | 1348.62 | 1389.7880249999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | In political liberty without the respect that he would have for it if he believed me. He could be inspired contempt for these popular images and feelings. In his work, he must change the propaganda themes so frequently that he cannot possibly attach himself to any formal sentimental, political, or other aspect of the ideology. Audiology is only one of the incidental and interchangeable cons. It is often stated that the propagandist eventually comes to despise not the organization served by propaganda is not basic interested in disseminating the doctrine spreading an ideology, or creating an orthodoxy. It seeks instead to unite within itself as many individuals | 1453.21 | 1545.748125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | the | 1513.7599999999998 | 1514.1799999999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The aim was the power of the pardon or state supported by the problem is no longer whether or not a political ideology is valid. The propagandist cannot ask himself that question. For him, it is senseless to debate | 1534.6599999999999 | 1586.828125 |
| SPEAKER_5 | whether | 1586.828125 | 1587.0681249999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the Marxist or whether the racist doctrine is true. Matters have no importance in the framework of propaganda. The only problem is that of effectiveness. Of utility. The point is not to ask oneself whether self economic or intellectual doctrine is valid. But only whether it can furnish effective catch words capable of mobilizing the man here and now. Therefore, when faced with an ideology that exists to the masses and commands a certain amount of unique, The propagandist must ask himself some questions. 1st, is this existing ideology an obstacle to the options we're taking? In many cases, such an ideology will indeed be an obstacle to blind action. It only to the extent that it starts some intellectual activity. No matter how feeble or provides criteria, no matter how insecure or judgment or action. In this case, the propagandist must be careful not to run head on into a promoting ideology. All he can do is introduce There's some hard to get. Reflective in | 1587.0681249999998 | 1667.3781249999997 |

| SPEAKER_4 | it. | 1830.677925 | 1831.177925 |
| SPEAKER_1 | In fact On the one hand, an ideology can be expressed in a textbook, It can be reduced to a simple idea, neatly anchored in the popular consciousness. In | 1802.87 | 1814.1599999999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | public | 1848.4681249999999 | 1848.6281249999997 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Words such as democracy, country, and social justice can now set off the desired reflexes. They have been reduced to stimuli capable of obtaining reflexes in public opinion. Can turn from adoration to hatred without transition. They evoke past actions and aspirations. To be sure, if a formula is to be able to stimulate, it must correspond existing conditioned reflexes that were forged gradually in the course | 1820.6399999999999 | 1882.578125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | of this | 1882.578125 | 1882.888125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The propagandist limits himself to what is already present. From there on, he can use any ideological content at all, no matter Differences in application will be determined according to psychological, historical, and economic criteria. To ensure the best utilization of ideology in the realm of action. I have said that ideology is a complex system capable of evoking one aspect while leaving out another. The propagandist stability will consist precisely in making these choices. On the other hand, the propagandist can proceed by trans it. Some ideologies can indeed serve as a springboard for the creation of myths, the propagandists. Such transformation rarely takes place spontaneously. Generally, | 1851.6898999999999 | 1898.3199999999997 |
| SPEAKER_5 | ideology | 1932.7682249999998 | 1933.2682249999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | is quite | 1933.4881249999999 | 1933.9681249999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | vague. Has little power to movement, do action. And cannot control the individual's entire consciousness. But it furnishes the elements of context and beauty, It wags itself to myth by the complicated mixture of ideas and sound by grafting the irrational onto political and economic elements. Ideology differs radically from it in that it has no basic roots, no relation to human primitive myths. I've already said that it would be impossible to create a complete new myth. True propaganda, However, the existence of an ideology within a group is the best possible foundation for the elaboration of a myth. In many cases, a operation and a more pressing and decisive formulation will suffice. That the message must be formulated for use by the man media automatically contributes to | 1933.9681249999999 | 1984.6881250000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | this. | 1984.6881250000001 | 1985.1881250000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The fact that the widespread belief is now expressed in 1 third, the number of words, and shout evigments of loud speakers using new force and urgency. The coloration supplied by psychological techniques the power of efficiency demonstrated by the integration in an action, the overall nature attributed to the construction of a new intellectual universe in which ideology is the keystone all that can be accomplished by the propagandist. In such fashion, socialist ideology was transformed into a by Leninist propaganda. Patriotic ideology became national news. And the ideology of happiness was transformed into myth at the end of 19th century. In this fashion too, the myth of progress was constructed from a group of papacy based on the law and neurology. Finally, the propagandist can use ideology for purposes of justice I have shown on several occasions that justification isn't the function of propaganda. The existence of a generally accepted ideology is remarkable instrument for providing a good conscience. And the propagandist refers to collective beliefs, The man whom he induces to act in accord with those beliefs will experience a feeling of almost unshakable self justification. Throughout the conformity with collective duties, provides security and the guarantee that one acts properly. Propaganda reveals this consonance to the individual. Renders the collective deemed perceptible, conscious, and personal for him. It gives him a good conscience by making him aware of the collectivity of | 1951.21 | 2079.8183249999997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | the needs. | 2079.8183249999997 | 2080.478125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Propaganda rationalizes the justification that man discovers in the prevailing idea and this in the power to express himself. This holds true the ideology of peace utilized by the kind of art. As soon as this ideology is used, everything, even hate to a succinct idea accepted by all. Our interested in objective moral of our state be outlined by an | 2046.83 | 2119.1281249999997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | ideology. | 2085.38 | 2085.88 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Democratic ideology sparked such an inquiry. But the relationship of ideology to propaganda has completely changed | 2120.488125 | 2093.23 |
| SPEAKER_4 | here. | 2127.923125 | 2128.423125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | In a group in which modern propaganda is being made, man no longer acts in accord with his spontaneous ideology. But only through impulses that come to him from such propaganda. Only the ignorant can still believe that ideas, doctrines, beliefs can make man act without the utilization of psycho sociological method. Ideology not used by propaganda is trying to Torture of political enemies is implicitly of a detainee. Which expresses its dismay only in words. But not | 2094.6598 | 2174.398125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | in action. | 2174.398125 | 2175.458125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Regard to the war in Algeria, it is well known that the most ardent of PHC Mole and then return it to expose the practice of torture during that war. Once they were in combat, plunged into action such ideas were relegated to a which on both sides accused the enemy of torture, thus legitimize its own actions took over again. The same is true for Christian ideology, which no longer inspires action. Christians are caught in a psycho sociological mechanism. I'm not interested in that. Those ideas remain pure ideology. Because they are not being taken over by propaganda. In this fashion, such an ideology loses its reality and becomes an abstraction. It loses all effectiveness in relation to other ideologies being used Moreover, in this relationship between radiology injection, we emphasize that nowadays, action creates ideabics. Not vice versa. The idealist who relate to past situations still would like to be mean. Through action, one learns to be mean in some truth. Even to formulate it. Today, ideology progressively builds itself around actions sanctioned For example, in order to justify certain actions in Algeria, an entire complex ideology was created. Thus, in various ways, all the result of propaganda Ideology is increasingly losing its importance. | 2141.8898 | 2275.928125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | In the modern world. | 2242.0299999999997 | 2277.458125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It is devalued like the propaganda used to promote. And cannot prevail against the competition. In the former because when used, it is broken up. Oh my | 2277.458125 | 2291.178125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | god. You fucking lied. Personal | 2291.178125 | 2292.3781249999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | side. The same holds true for ideology as for guns. The transformation of the Marxist doctrine dotcom begins first, Lenin's and then Stalin's. Works such as those by Jean Chambre, Delachem, and Lukacs explained this evisceration of doctrine by propaganda very | 2292.3781249999997 | 2314.618125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | well. | 2314.618125 | 2315.118125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | All those believed, known, and accepted is what propaganda has promulgated It is the same for ideology, which is nearly a popular and sentimental One can no longer establish anything at all on genuine ideologies and social One can no longer hope to find such ideologies as solid part of support for an aggressive manner of society. Ideology has become part of the system of propaganda. The bank depends on this can have decisive consequences. | 2280.95 | 2347.698125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Propaganda on the side they pride from the individual. Which I attempted to sketch in the preceding chapter. Obviously, I've collected consequences. Massive effects. If only because the mass is composed of individuals and because propaganda designs to act on the mass at the same time change People become influenced and quartered. This leads necessarily to modifications important for new changes in the concept of public opinion. For example, whether a favorable opinion of Negroes turns into | 2341.822405 | 2376.622405 |
| SPEAKER_1 | for note. This coincides with a well known fact that there were relationship exists between the structure of opinion and the size of organization of groups. Propaganda simultaneously commodifies the structure of the and make a group both sympathetic and peaceful. Modification of the constituent elements of publication. On the subject, I will not repeat for John Stipson has already demonstrated in his case detail based opinion. Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, | 2341.72428 | 2414.558145 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Paris, Paris, Paris, in Paris, 1983, To begin with, certain factors of change are easy to It is often been said that come with opinion forms itself while exchanges of opinion on a controversial question. And shapes itself by the interaction of these different viewpoints. But an examination of the effects of propaganda must radically destroy a central view of the formation of public opinion. On the one hand, as I've already shown, the question that Abigail takes upon itself cease to be controversial. Truths are pronounced, they do not dare discussion. They are viewed or not believed, and that is all. At the same time, interpersonal communications cease. And propagandize new communications no longer in place in interpersonal patterns, but in patterns by the propaganda organization. There is action, but no interaction. As I have shown, the propaganda and the nonpropagandy cannot discuss. No sociologically acceptable communication or exchange is possible between them. Finally, in large societies, in which propaganda is at work, opinion can no longer form itself except to be an | 2415.246795 | 2485.122405 |
| SPEAKER_0 | essential Ryan. | 2485.122405 | 2452.90428 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Bye. No opinion was of any consequence unless the first communicated to him by the vast media of dissemination of propaganda. In due to reject the turn of laws. Public opinion and propaganda. New York, Henry Colton Company 1948. Chapter 5. One can easily see that propaganda plays precisely the role that you've assigned to public opinion. To reduce frustration, anxiety, and so on. And the propaganda directly creates propaganda by eventually creating, conforming, and externalizing inner opinions. But I don't proceed along any other way. The first effect I will try to analyze is what is state we call crystallization of public opinion. Shirley Stetson is right when he says, on the basis of a man process is not so simple as it seems. Frequently, it is said that a few scattered individual opinions suddenly by a mysterious operation unite in form of a defendant. It is then said that one of the elements in this process is propaganda. Stetzel has shown that things do not happen that way. But the pain does not arise from individual opinions. Here, we are faced with 2 heterogeneous colleagues. We cannot speak of a crystallization of individual opinion. Rather a vague, inconsistent, unformulated, latent opinion which one might hold raw opinion is transformed by propaganda to a true process of crystallization into explicit opinion. What does this imply? From here on, we will be in the presence of organized opinion having a serve cellar. There is no progression at all from a state of private opinion to a state of public | 2487.272405 | 2611.272405 |
| SPEAKER_0 | opinion. | 2611.332385 | 2611.822405 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But only from one state of public opinion to another state of that same public opinion. | 2577.67428 | 2616.402405 |
| SPEAKER_2 | A | 2583.30426 | 2583.38428 |
| SPEAKER_1 | changing in versatile opinion becomes fixed. Is given strict orientation. Propaganda specifies precisely the objectives of that opinion and to their many needs, there In that way, propaganda also affects the individual reducing his field of thought and angle of vision by the creation of stereotype. But we're only vague in connections until intervention propaganda now take the form of ideas. This is all the more remarkable because propaganda, as you have seen, adds much more through emotional shock than through reasoned conviction. And, nevertheless, produces by that shock and ideological elaboration that gives great precision and stability to the ensuing appeal. But this hardening of the opinion is neither totally nor coherent. That is why I speak about scale. This makes even more sense if one keeps in mind that the process of propaganda can consisting of micro groups. Highly organized and endowed with great strength and conviction. These are precisely destined to crystallize opinemia. Help it to formulate and thus to play the role in scale. This was Lenin's theory. Crystalization takes place at certain points. Propaganda does not produce generalized and differentiated ideas, but very specific opinions which cannot be applied just anywhere. And the degree of effectiveness of a propaganda depends precisely on its choice of A working hardening opinion on a certain key point. One can control an entire sector of opinion. This heartening of opinion soon makes it impervious to all contrary reason, proof, and thought. Laden opinion subjected to such complicated even as well made, without discrimination. This will cause a thing in the past to the stage of crystallization. And from that moment on, opinion will no longer accept anything that is different. I already have shown that even approved that. Do nothing against crystallizing the thing. Such organization of opinion leads always to a certain unification. Opinion will begin to eliminate its own contradictions and establish itself as a function of identical touch words that will inevitably have a unifying effect. Besides, at that moment, individual opinions also changed. Where the hardening of public opinion distorts their originality. Details and nuances A good example of this process is the formation of press consciousness by Marxist propaganda. After the creation of Christ consciousness, like the foundation of information, of which I have spoken | 2617.692405 | 2795.152425 |
| SPEAKER_2 | above. | 2795.152425 | 2795.652425 |
| SPEAKER_1 | In the transformation of this blind's consciousness by propaganda, into a system. The criterion of judgment. Of even The stereotype. Abbogadov led to the elimination of all of the evil entire views and finally granted Labour's opinion impenetrable. To all that did not conform to the initial tariff. Present day class consciousness is a typical product of character leads us to a second propaganda effect on epidemic. By the process of simplification, propaganda makes it take shape more rapidly. Without simplification, no public opinion can exist anywhere in the world. The more complex problems, judgments, and criteria are, the more the case of individual. The more the case of individual, nuances and gradations prevent public opinion from forming. The more complicated it is, the longer it takes to assume solid shape. But in the case of such diffusion, propaganda intervenes with a force of simplification. Our routines are reduced to 2, positive and negative. In plain view, propaganda will simply place anyone with more differentiated opinions into one room or the other. For example, a man not altogether favored will climb communism is simply thrown into the fascist creep by propaganda. Even if he tries to think in terms of social justice. And even if he rejects capitalism, without being an ally of bourgeois imperialism, he becomes one. | 2761.75428 | 2885.972405 |

| SPEAKER_1 | propaganda presents the complex process of political We have taken that as previously unavailable only to experts and the small number Discussion Footnote, news. Mason and Istov This 1935. Answers to problems are clear cut. White and black. Under such conditions, covered the pain points rapidly. Breaks, loops, and expresses itself. It then carries along on its irresistible course all differentiated and average opinions that have appeared too late for inclusion in the process crystallizing opinion. We already have seen how from the psychological point of view, propaganda reinforces and even creates stereotypes and prejudice The producers now, they cannot of the solely individual psychology. It is the individual in relation to others who has prejudices and their crystal Of course, prejudices arise spontaneously. Propaganda uses them for the formation of over the corner. Which in turn becomes simplified under the rigid separation very judiciously demonstrated by Stetson between individual and covered The distinction between stereotype opinions and profound attitudes leads us back to the distinction between public and private Stereotypes are the categories of public opinion. Profound attitudes, on the other hand, exist where people live by the laws And the 2 types of opinion can coexist without interchange or natural influence. We are thus thinking in two ways. As members of a social body and as individual. In the former case, one may say that we are abandoning ourselves to a thought that is not ours. And there is no reason why diverse opinions of that kind should be coherent or unified in the system. That is the task of propaganda. But we also have our private views. The effect of propaganda is to separate the two types of opinion still more. Ordinarily, some theater play between the 2 sectors continues, but this is short circuit with this nice and over. Relations of the local Why would you possible | 2896.642405 | 3035.94425 |

| SPEAKER_1 | The more individual the claims you confirm, the In this fashion, non psychological processes separated into 2 underrelated elements. I'm a painter to action. I've said on several occasions that propaganda aimed less at modifying personal opinions than at meeting people into action. This is clearly its most stunning result. When propaganda intervenes in public opinion, it transforms the public into an acting crowd or more precisely into a participating crowd. Often propaganda translates itself only into verbal action. This will be examined later. But what matters is that the crowd passed from the state of being mere spectator filled with opinions to the state of participants. Even if a moviegoer is taken with the film, he remains passive. He has a personal opinion of the future we see. | 3102.56428 | 3199.692405 |
| SPEAKER_3 | External. | 3169.9692800000003 | 3170.4692800000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The spectator at a bullfight is in a somewhat different situation. His participation in the killing ritual is sometimes passive, but sometimes active. When he storms into the ring, Robagadda goes much further and demands an acceptance that is not that of a set leader. It demands his support as a mirror. His active participation is a maximum. Firdna, On the subject of passive appearance, alas, in remarkable example is contained in a pamphlet by the OAS, February 10, 1962. Which states that we do not ask all officers to join our ranks but merely to show no zeal from applying government direction. Abigand evidently plays its part when a normal spontaneous development of opinion itself into private noncollective attitudes. Only very rarely is opinion by itself. It has often been said that propaganda is not create attitudes that merely uses them. Taking the term in the specific sense of social psychology, I must agree but the fact is not so simple. It is evident that propaganda itself does not modify either. But when propaganda needs to action, it modifies, first of all, the response that would otherwise be a direct result of the fundamental attitude. The individual expressing his attitude would not act, but under the influence of other which, if often repeated, will change his behavior pattern. Moreover, when the individual is engaged in action, the has been set in motion by propaganda, he cannot escape counterbloat an orientation | 3170.75424 | 3317.932405 |
| SPEAKER_2 | different from that | 3318.952405 | 3319.402405 |
| SPEAKER_1 | preparation for action. Is only an attitude. But this attitude is also determined by the action which is engaged and by the social context The continuous and automatic action into which propaganda plunges the individual Undoubtedly also creates attitudes that determine further actions. Does this progression from opinion to action through the channel of propaganda take place? New is one of the few. Attitudes affect behavior. If their force is so great, there's an irreducible except by action. This force, which may be weak or strong in the beginning, accumulates when the individual feels that action is necessary. For he to show the action, | 3285.0942800000003 | 3366.352405 |
| SPEAKER_2 | which I do this for | 3366.352405 | 3367.792405 |
| SPEAKER_0 | him. | 3367.792405 | 3368.292405 |
| SPEAKER_1 | In short, the achievement of a prepared response is only the last of the series of preliminary stages, which though necessary for the final action to take place, do not guarantee that it will. Seeing this perspective, action is the result of a certain number of coordinated influences created by | 3337.7143800000003 | 3390.702405 |
| SPEAKER_3 | footnote. | 3358.2741800000003 | 3358.7741800000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | One must note for the individual, a specific preord simple task we undertake at a given moment. From the moment propaganda succeeds in personalizing its appeal, the individual who feels concerned is placed in a situation that demands a decision Mao has achieved this completely with his Oh | 3359.62418 | 3379.57428 |
| SPEAKER_0 | my god. I'm doing | 3413.8824050000003 | 3414.782405 |
| SPEAKER_2 | this. | 3415.402405 | 3415.4824049999997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Propaganda can make the And at the same time, top again, the show's important. Individual who burns with desire for action but does not know what to do is a common type in our society. Must do act for the sake of justice. Peace, conquest. Does not know how. If propaganda can show him this how, it is Action will surely follow. The individual also must be convinced of the success of his action or of the possible reward or satisfaction we get from him. Man relax when he feels that a certain result needs to be obtained. And that the need is urgently. Advertising demonstrates it to him in the commercial domain. Propaganda demonstrates it in politics. Finally, now when we help in this progression through action by example. By similar action all around him. But such similar action did not come to his attention except to the media of | 3415.4824049999997 | 3442.3042800000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | propaganda. | 3476.692405 | 3477.192405 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This is undoubtedly the true pattern in many aspects. But one element overlooked here is essential in my view The element of the mass crowd. | 3444.40418 | 3488.362405 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Put out | 3456.37428 | 3491.1324050000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Man subjected to propaganda would never act if he were alone. Du makes an analysis of man by himself. Though the mechanisms that he reveals can work only with collective man. An individual can feel the urgency of an action only it promises to be effective because it is being carried out by many. He cannot engage in action except with others. This means that if propaganda is to lead to action, it must also have a collective impact. Stuff. That includes is composed of 2 main factors. 1, propaganda creates a strong integration of the group. And at the same time activates the preoccupations of that group. The mass media provoked an intense participation in the life of the group and in collective activities. They provide a strong feeling of community. In our society, the individual communicates with the group only through the mass media of information. The indispensable psychological contact among members of the group is produced only by news media. For under mass society, individuals have a tendency to withdraw from each other more and more. Their relationship is only artificial. It is only the product of the information media. Spontaneous relationships change character when they become organized. Systematized, and deliberate. At this point, personal relations tends to create unanimity in the literal sense. And such unanimity always takes on a force of expansion. And the group requires a certain conformity. It inevitably experiences the meaningful pursuit through action. That moment, the psychological con the communication of creating what nearly a feeling of community. If such truth dealt with internal verities, it would not push the victim into action. But at the same time as a mass media, the great the group, they place it in relation to the press. After all, the content of present day is a human being, but means of the moment. But this goes much further when the media are purposely used for propaganda. Stetson has actively said that the stereotypes of propaganda immediately appear to have the significance of actuality. Even in actuality made aggressive and further an actuality that is present. | 3467.82428 | 3638.962405 |
| SPEAKER_3 | A good thing is some of | 3639.262505 | 3640.472405 |
| SPEAKER_1 | psychologically unanimous and finds itself face to face with such planned actuality feels concerned to the highest degree. What is this actuality? It is precisely the world in which the group itself and its fittering god. And in which the group has the possibility of acting. And propaganda integrates the group into an actuality if necessarily leads it to acting that actuality. The group cannot remain constant and we can take | 3606.16428 | 3666.162405 |
| SPEAKER_2 | actuality. | 3633.93428 | 3634.43428 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This group has no other frame of reference by which it could take a different position. In other words, it has only one point of view toward that actuality. The group, therefore, cannot consider its subspecies eternal purpose because its frame of reference is furnished by the very propaganda that you might see in the actuality the first place. And the group cannot judge its own position. At that moment, to participate in any group or whatever is to submit to actuality. To become a man without past or future. They have no concern other than action, no belief other than that promise. Giving by propaganda concerned with president. 2, the other aspect of the progression to action is the great power that propagandicates to opinion. This opinion is no longer a myth, but time is unsure of itself. Spreading slowly by word-of-mouth can be difficult for opinion surveys to pinpoint. It is projected outside itself. Meets itself, and hears itself on the screen and the airwaves. Invested with power of | 3638.39428 | 3734.262405 |
| SPEAKER_3 | grandeur magnificence. | 3734.262405 | 3735.012405 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Such opinion runs to me with itself. Certain now that it views truth, because it is seen itself revealed and promulgated on all sides on how When can they say without exaggeration, the propaganda replaces the leader of the This is not a banal assertion that propaganda is the instrument of the unit group. Helps to make a leader. It means that in a group without a leader, but subjected to propaganda, the sociological and psychological effects are the same as if they were a viewer. Propaganda is a substitute for him. If we remember the innumerable roles played by the | 3701.37428 | 3778.262405 |
| SPEAKER_3 | group leader, | 3778.262405 | 3779.082405 |

| SPEAKER_0 | Oh my god. What you fuck, Garrett? | 3800.47428 | 3836.242405 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Entirely abnormal. But the substitute for the true leader by propaganda and exists through it. Once comes the possibility of having a chief present when he is absent. Merely an effort integrated into the circuit of propagandism, sequences. The portraits of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Roosevelt, play an abstract with sufficient role but the effects that can be accepted from the leader's presence are obtained instead. This is the second element of the progression from a female to direct action. 3, propaganda and grooming. I've selected this leather bag heading because I cannot undertake a complete study of the pump again effects on the aggregate of all groups in society. For that, I will need a complete theoretical and experimental sociology. Besides, with regard to the propaganda effect, one must distinguish between the groups that make it and the groups that are subjected to it. Often, the 2 elements are closely related. This study will examine 3 examples. Parties, the world of labor, and projections the partitioning of groups, All propaganda has to set off its group from all the other groups. Here we find again the fallacious character in the intellectual communication press radio. | 3836.462405 | 3925.402405 |

| SPEAKER_1 | That its actions are justified. Thus, it remains to strengthen. At the same time, such propaganda contains elements of criticism and reputation of other groups. Which will never be read or heard by member of another | 3981.83428 | 4028.342305 |

| SPEAKER_1 | will contain valid criticism of and genuine facts about dictatorship in the Soviet Union. Will never reach a communist. If this criticism one's neighbor, which is not heard by that neighbor, is known to those inside the group that expresses it. The anti communist will be constantly more convinced of the evilness of the communist. Than vice versa. As a result, people ignored the gun laws. They see altogether to be open to an exchange of reason, arguments, points of view. This double play on the top together proving the excellence of one zone group and the evilness of the others, produces an increasingly stringent partitioning of our society. A religious partitioning. The partitioning of political parties or finances. Beyond that, a partitioning of nations and at the summit. A partitioning of blockers of nations. But this diversity of levels and objectives in no way changes the basic law according to which the more propaganda there is, the more partitioning there is. | 4007.33428 | 4106.152505 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Here's the subjects. And justifies oneself. One must not think incidentally that such part is in conflict with the formation of public opinion. Although propaganda partitions society, it affects opinion and transcends the groups in which it operates. In the first place, it maintains its effectiveness toward the of undecided who do not yet belong to a group. Then, too, it is possible to affect those who belong to a group of a different sort. For example, communist propaganda that will not affect the militant | 4124.5311249999995 | 4155.041125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | in his capacity as Frenchman. I influence him with regard to capitalism or the liberal system. This is particularly important because there is a difference of level between the groups. For example, a nationalist propaganda results in building a barrier against other nations. However, domestically, it respects the isolation of imperial groups, but still affects them by making them join a common collective movement. This is a process comparable to the reach and The national propaganda is purposely effective inside the nation. And changes public opinion. For a historic propaganda or religious propaganda is effective on another plane. Each having the power to modify public opinion on a certain level. And to produce a sociological partition in Northern Europe. But only a superior group can affect other groups. That is why with respect to the key current power blocks, east and west, we're now deciding security. The epidemic can only have the effect of increasingly separating. A well organized propaganda will work with all of these different elements. This explains the new algorithm with some propagandist. For example, the USSR. On one side, in the papers with large circulation or on the label. One finds only ecstatic praise of the regime or vague criticism regime. One can find a line of precise and impartial information in these rooms. How can this be rather than tolerated? It can be explained only by practitioner. One must tell the public about the grandeur of the revolution and the excellence of the without any connection to Soviet reality as a whole. A disappointing personal experience is only an accident without meaning. Danger. Aims at showing department's vigilance, its knowledge of detail, its its centralized control, its demand for communist perfection. Is aimed at the massive technicians broken up into groups of specialists. Such propaganda asserts that the regime is excellent that all services are working very well except the service in question. Medical for the doctors and so on. How is such a development possible Precisely by virtue of the partition which to such a large extent propagandist work. Because one knows that the doctor will not read emergency medicine. And because one knows that the public at large will not read any of the specialized journals, and because one knows that the Ukrainians will not read Georgian newspapers, one can. According to necessity, make contradictory decisions in in and over time. Obviously, this procedure further increases separation. Everyone stops speaking the language of the others. With all means of being communication remains. Different facts are given to different people. The basis of judgment are diverse. The orientations are on process. There is no longer a meeting point within the confines of the same propaganda or this propaganda scientifically. Not spontaneously, as in the case study earlier, develops divided lines. Establishes psychological separations between groups, and does all this under a common collective quote called unreality point. And verbal fiction. Effects on political parties. What happens when a political party stops acting more or less haphazardly? Starts to make systematic propaganda? And instead of trying to win votes at election time, begin to mobilize public opinion in a more permanent fashion. Actually, in the Democratic nations, practically, no party has tried this. But we can see the emergence of parties grafting themselves under old ones, so replace And these new parties have such their predecessors did not have. The transformation is taking place in the political parties of the United States For about a dozen years now, they have been making systematic propaganda but it is still too early to tell what transformations it may entail in the parties themselves. Therefore, we will instead those parties that make propaganda. As distinguished from those that do not. And consider that their structure derives partially from their need to make of a game. The party that makes propaganda must, first of all, have the means to tone. It is necessary that the part presents itself as a community in which everybody has a set function. And that its members at the bottom be rigorously organized and strictly obedient. If one wants to reach public opinion constantly, one must pursue with the help of sections and cells. The system of committees, which express themselves weekly, leads only to sporadic and fragmentary action. In addition, propaganda demands vertical liaison among the parties of organizations. This vertical liaison permits both homogeneity of propaganda and speed of application. And we have seen that speed of action is essential to the economy. Conversely, it deal with the effect of propaganda in creating isolated social and local groups. Any horizontal liaison inside the party will be disastrous. Those at the base of the party would not understand why one propaganda is made in one place. Another elsewhere. On the contrary, the partitioning by propaganda must correspond to the partitioning within the party. And the only liaison system must be vertical. More important still is a system of executive contracts. This produces from the beginning a schism between the contracts and the voters or sympathizers corresponds precisely to the separation into subjects involved in. Propaganda makes its agent a subject to make the decisions and uses those systems that must obtain certain results but the agent looks upon the mass of potential voters as sympathizers as objects. He manipulates them. Works on them, tests them, changes the several lines. For your sympathy. Propaganda, therefore, intensifies this information by creating the image of a reader and investigating it without the the presence and our mission. Only sense and anticipate. Any party that avoids this personalization of power loses a probably decisive card. We have seen this in the American election of 1952, the 1000 hour. And tied to the organization of propaganda itself. In connection with certain parties, Louverge speaks of a second power. An obscure power that sometimes dominates the direction of the party. This second power sometimes consists of influential man on the paper whose This fact needs to be generalized. In modern parties, the 2nd power is likely to consist of the core of propagandists. The same holds true for the state itself. A position, not with our occasional serious handrails, for they are in one and the same time the hub of the entire party, and this was on death row. These are the principal effects of the adoption of modern propaganda. The structure of a political party. With regard to the relative effects on the interplay of parties in the The decisive development is a high cost to propaganda. Propaganda is becoming more and more expensive. Partly because of the bombing need partly because of the instruments required, All parties may stick to traditional low level propaganda. Posters, newspapers, newspapers, and go to the government for the more expensive media, radio, TV, such as the case in France. Under such circumstances, there is a state in equilibrium that are precarious. The situation is in a tense unstable. If one party resorts to propaganda, the whole edifice tumbles. A single party takes big propaganda action while the others cannot lead group or put in operations and necessary to the apparatus because they left money. Of the union. For the communist party This is clearly a man who denies it. We are base to base an overwhelming and strong part of the government. This body continues to grow stronger as it becomes richer and it seems more solid propaganda foundation. It definitely jeopardizes the democratic system. Even if it has no dictatorial ambitions. For the other party They have incapable of regaining the mass of those 75%, more or less undecided are increasingly unable to use fake propaganda. This happened from the progress in the communist parties in France and Italy came to an end after 1948. With a regression of their propaganda. Which was by no means attributable to their past mistakes. The second hypothesis is the opposition parties find a reply the propaganda. The propaganda. But this can only lead to a regrouping of forces, which is hard to obtain because internal squabbles are stronger than the need for a common counter propaganda. As in France, between 1949 into 1958, or by an appeal to the government which made them put communication means into and to oppose some totalitarian propaganda. This was a case in Belgium in connection with Brexit counter propaganda. The third hypothesis, a party or a block of parties almost as powerful as the would be runaway party, starts propaganda before it is pushed to the wall. This is the case in the United States, and it might be in France if the regrouping of the right should become stabilized. In that situation, one would necessarily have For financial reasons, a democracy reduced to 2 part It being inconceivable that a larger number of parties would have some sufficient means to make such propaganda. This would lead to a bad podcast. Oh | 4124.373 | 4876.721125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | my god. You seem to have gotten | 4876.721125 | 4878.311125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | for technical propaganda reason. This implies the exclusion of important in the future. Not only are secondary pardons progressively eliminated, but this becomes impossible to organize any political groups with any chance at all of making the curve. In the midst of a considerable power and the forces of work, it becomes increasingly difficult to establish a new program. So On the other hand, such a group would mean from the beginning a great deal of money. Many members of great power, Under such conditions, a new party could only be in Tanzania. Emerging fully grown from Zeus's core. A political organization would have had to collect money for a long time. To have bought propaganda instruments in United States members, the it made its appearance as a party incapable of resisting the pressures of those who possess the media. Not just the mere organization of a new party is becoming increasingly difficult, so is expression of a new political idea. Idea is no longer exist except through the media of information. And the latter are in the hands of the existing parties now truly revolutionary or new doctrine has any chance of expressing itself. That is an interesting Yet innovation was one of the principal characteristics of democracy. Now because nobody wants it any longer, it tends to disappear. One can say that propaganda almost inevitably leads to a 2 party system. Not only would it be very difficult for several parties to be rich enough to support such extensive campaigns of propaganda, But also, propaganda tends to schematize public opinion. When there's propaganda, we find fewer and fewer nuances in findings in detail in doctor. Rather, opinions are more incisive There is only black and white. Yes and no. Such a state of public opinion needs directly to a 2 party system and the disappearance of a multiparty system. The effects of propaganda can also be clearly seen in view of what Hubertje calls the party with the majority mandate and the party without that mandate. The party with the majority mandate controlled narrowly should command an absolute majority in parliament. Is normally the one that has been created by propaganda. Propaganda's principal Trump's then stood out of the hand of the other party. The latter can do then is to make them a biologic propaganda. That is a false propaganda that is truly artificial. Considering what you have said about the relationship between propaganda and reality. In other words, the party out of power must pick an artificial issue. In that case, we find ourselves faced with 2 completely propaganda. On one side is a propaganda powerful and techniques, but really in its ends and modes of expression. Propaganda strictly integrating into a given social group, performance, and status. For excessive entertainment and expressions, a propaganda aimed against the existing order, against the state. Against prevailing group standards. But one must never forget that the party with the majority mandate which he just seeks propaganda to that mandate and even views the mandate as a propaganda aim is nevertheless also the creation of propaganda. Which hides a dead man in a given setting and for a long period of time. Finally, a last word on the financial problems and verification. It is improbable that contributions of love would enable a party to pay for the increasingly expensive propaganda media. The parties are therefore forced to look for aid either to capitalists and thus indenture themselves through a financial oligarchy or to a government, national, or foreign. In the second case, the state comes close to appropriating the instrument. The state then lends them to those who ask for them which is very democratic and best for its secondary parties to live. But this leads to an unstable situation, as I said earlier. And the state is then increasingly forced to exercise censorship over is being said by means of his instrument. This censorship will be increasingly rigorous as the state itself is forced make more propaganda. This leads us to examine the hypothesis of a state that ceases to be moved in the ideological domain. And assumes a doctrine or ideology of its own. At that moment, propaganda by mistake is imposed on all parties. We'll be sure we are still dealing with propaganda. We have seen in the past decades with regard to all state that power must first be used to shape public opinion. Without pushback or not offer. Thus are the beginnings of the Nazi state. Or a popular democracy, A certain competition continued between the propaganda of the state. And that of the parties out of power. But in such competition, the state necessarily emerges victorious. It increasingly denies the use of the mass media of communication for the opposition party. It works on public opinion until the moment arrives, and simply suppress opposition parties without clear. The state can work on public opinion only to be for the media of the party. This is another effective propaganda. One could conceive of a state that would suppress all pardons and live by itself, that was across a pattern of dictatorship. However, that is no longer possible. Once public opinion has been aroused and the verdict political problems, it must be taken into consideration. The propaganda mechanism of the state cannot function as an administrative unit It cannot have reality or efficiency except through the media of the state party. It is impossible to imagine that a modern state could command except without working through a party establishing contact between those who govern and public opinion. The party Sunday had a role to submit propaganda for the government. That is propaganda that the government wishes to be made. In one sense, incidentally, we find here the image of a park in its purest state. For ultimate the every party is a propaganda machine. But this is much more hidden in other systems in which there are still some nuances of the And the dictatorship's department no longer serves any ideological or political function. No longer expresses social interest, and so on. Is an organ designed to contain and train public opinion. And exists solely because of the state's need. As soon as that need diminishes, the role and prestige of the party also diminish. This happened in Nazi Germany in 1938. Footnotes. After the concentration of all powers in your fewer's hands, Under the Soviet Union, after the purges of 1936, But as soon as propaganda again becomes important, the party resumes its role. Propaganda very clearly gives direction to the life of political parties. Imposes certain forms and rules on them, sends them down certain paths, and ends up by deciding their life for death until the regime expands to the point they reach propaganda and pardon are totally free. I was not trying to say that propaganda is the only factor in the evolution of parties. It certainly combines with other elements of which one can say. However, that they either are of less importance than propaganda or are tied in with it. With it. The effects on the world of labor. We now come face to face with one of the modern world's most critical problems. We were in agreement. That is the condition of the worker. Created by technological developments used in the beginning by capitalism, and used now by socialization. Socialism has claimed that the workers' condition was the food of capitalism and that the exploitation of workers by finance capital. This does, to some extent, explain both the depressed condition of the worker and the But it is not the major factor. Labor conditions result in the relation between man and machine. And they're a consequence of technological developments taken into broad sense. Urbanization, massification, streamlining, the disappearance of the notion of work, mechanization, and so on. All beings are much more responsible for labor conditions than at the means of production are part of the own. This last fact is the polarization according to Marxist theory. The polarization is only one aspect. Once socialism has taken the means of production out of private hands, politically speaking, the working class and, frankly speaking, is no longer the proletariat. But it remains in the grip of the same country. Undoubtedly, the problem of poverty can be solved. But nothing indicates that it can be more easily solved under socialism than undercapital Few workers except farmers the United States, live in poverty. But one cannot say that the labor problem has been solved even there. If we look at the situation of labor in socialist countries, we see that the workers still insubordinate to the machine. That he has little personal life. That he is involved in the mass, and that he is prayed to the problems connected with the artificially mentioned days more than, potentially, from his work, false culture, ignorance of environment, divorce from nature, artificial life, and so on. But we also see that the problem of profits is not being solved. And that the worker still is not properly paid. The only difference is that the profit is known by the state. And denied by private individual. In addition, we see that in socialist countries, most local legislation Those advanced as in capitalist countries from the point of view of security, family allocations, vacations, and all sorts of financial rewards Has we progressed with regard to universal? There are to strike in work discipline. We see finally that the worker in no way by participates fundamentally in the life of his factory. In socialist countries, the works council may make suggestions only with regard to secondary question. With regard to principal questions, he merely ratifies the decisions of a 5 year Furthermore, collective ownership of the means of is pure fiction. The workers own nothing, and though it was regarded as machines, in the same situation as workers under capitalism. Whether it be the state or the entire collective. Which must necessarily be represented by some organization, The proprietor has nothing to do with the workers in the factory. This notion of collective ownership corresponds on the economic plane. To the old idea of the sovereign people, the political plane, We know how much harm better idea that fiction, that obstruction has done the thing of the scene in the power of the people. I cannot perceive this point here, but I can assert that the situation of labor has not really changed as a result of social Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the attitude of the workers is different. Except in rare cases, the working class has given the support to the regimes and communist countries. There is no longer a claims in opposition but is really in accord with the regime. And the concrete situation seems to be that there no longer is an antidote of rebellion. The workers put their hearts in their work. Abandon themselves to their work. No longer wish to engage and slow down. This is so no matter how much the entire communist is denied. Something undoubtedly has changed. Regard to the labor situation in communist country. But the workers have not been integrated by force, What has changed First of all, is the social climate. The worker is no longer excluded from society. The feeling of being excluded from society is felt society. He was a pariah and outsider. The society of a certain criteria and have so certain basic structures that the worker is not included in. The problem of private property is only a symbol of that exclusion. Which in turn produces the proletariat. But in socialist society, the worker is at the center of a world that is being built. She is in an honored position. The society is a noble This is said constantly. Is demonstrated in various cultural, political, and economic ways. This climate has changed the worker's reaction. He is now convinced that he's important. He is also convinced that society is not against him, but for him. In this society, this is a chamber, and that he is being run to go will be grand in the place he deserves He is also still with the positive conviction that lets him forget to neglect the external reality of his situation. The worker in the socialist world no longer looks at this the hope. It is his hope that the coming world will be a just world. Or more precisely a world in which the workers certainly will occupy first It is also his conviction in hope that every piece of work every day of work put in by him That's a perfect to build socialist disseminated. Whereas in capitalist countries, work serves only to produce a wage and profits only to capitalists. There, the worker experiences frustration Under socialism, the experience is a feeling of fulfillment. The changes that have taken place in labor's situation are not actual changes, but only those of a different Concepcion of what? Conviction and hope. This is indeed socialism's only genuine innovation but the transformation is effective. The workers work more and better. Put more hard in their work, and accept strict discipline with conviction. Footnote, In 1960, the conference in Moscow, we only need eating chalk. Stated that ideological education must aim at increasing productivity. The norms of the workers, and personal sacrifices. I have already said that the principal function of propaganda in the USSR is to help fulfill the 5 year plan. You've seen that work. Those to increase the workers' effort This reminds me of what MG Friedman has said on the importance of the psychological factor in working condition and productivity. He believes that the psychological necessities can be satisfied only by the socialist. Only in socialism can the worker rid of his complexes and resentments attained the psychological freedom that permits him to dedicate himself But nothing indicates that this is the only solution. Even the fact that public relations in the United States tends to show that psychological means not only change the general climate considerably, but also change the inner persuasion of each worker and integrating more into his But this alteration is not the image of those movements. And we must wait to see whether a profound transformation of the working class by public relations is possible. This law needs to have lead us to say, we deliver results to some extent from the factual situation and to some extent psychological factors. If we want to be honest, we must admit that for the factual situation, no solution is available in any of this social, political, or economic period. Of course, one can make the worker happy and give him security, A mixture of palletting is already known and partly utilized can modify the consequences of his situation but not really the situation itself. 1 must recognize that without trying to make a mystery out of the working class, no solution exists for its concrete problem. Psychological solution. The modification that was a catalog of socialist psychology can be attained by other men. Other forms of No. I | 4844.99295 | 5834.942999999999 |

| SPEAKER_0 | I sat with him. Yep. | 5871.401124999999 | 5872.481125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Answers. And just as communism and his hard work, well, governments, the use of propaganda on the political plane It is now teaching them to use it on the social side and on the problems of labor. Nowadays, we see complete disregard for the problem of labor with the help of psychological narcotics. What he could not even do an absolute. Or to give him reasons to continue his work and to do it well. This is a task of propaganda, and there is no doubt that if it is done well, it will make possible the integration of the working class. And make it accept its condition happily. In one way or another, propaganda is called the bond to solve the labor problem. To the extent that the problem becomes a political factor and can be true in the system of the modern world. Only those who do not know the capability to modern propaganda conduct the possibility of such a solution. Of course, to make such integration propaganda of the labor class successful, several conditions must obtain. First of all, the material conditions of labor must improve. I've constantly stressed the link between propaganda and crew reform. But that does not suffice in the least. On the contrary, the improvement in material conditions of the work of become a springboard for better revolutionary education as history showed. A certain development of technical education and information is needed The more the worker becomes a technician, the more he becomes second floor. At the same time, if he is provided with a broader base of information, he will become more susceptible to propaganda. According to the mechanism analyzed early. Finally, some unity of psychological action isn't As long as the worker is enclosed in such organizations, his pardon is a union which subject him to a propaganda opposed to his integration into society, The partition which we discussed earlier, takes place One of the most important factors in this connection is that in socialist countries, the unions have become organizations in harmony society. Make the same propaganda. The same holds true in the United States. The unions | 5851.9929999999995 | 6030.586025 |
| SPEAKER_0 | This is inherent in the structure and rationale And from the moment that the union wants to engage in public Of course, union propaganda has a character of itself. It is much more human, cost less, uses the devotion of union members. Their posthuman contact in Sylwira.

| SPEAKER_2 | Boy, do I have a lot to say about this discussion. So Chris Cuomo of NewsNation had on Jamie Peck a lively discussion about for profit health care and Luigi Mangione. Now Pac is a self described communist and host of the Party Girls podcast, also formerly of the majority report. And is introduced here on NewsNation as a spokesperson for the Luigi Mangione Defense Fund. Speaking of this, fundraising that is going on, Now I wanna be clear. It's not clear to me whether or not Jamie actually set this up whoever set up is is anonymous. She is speaking on behalf of them. Here, and they have raised over a 150 $1,000 the goal is $500,000. To be clear, they go on to write as well. This is a preemptive legal fundraiser for the suspect allegedly involved in the of the UnitedHealthcare CEO We are not here to celebrate violence, but we do believe in the constitution right of fair | 44.968125 | 100.878129 |
| SPEAKER_0 | legal representation. | 100.938125 | 101.688125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Not clear whether or not this was set up before it was known that Luigi Mangione can clearly pay for his own lawyer, so, again, it's not clear to me where the money is actually going to go. I don't think they're it sounds like they're not going to accept from what I'm what I'm reading, but regardless, I wanna get to the first clip here and I just got a lot to say about what this what this means In terms of the discourse around What? Is going on right now in terms of health care, but also the discourse around what the left actually is. Help me understand. Why is it a beautiful thing? | 67.74 | 135.788125 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Why do you support him assassinating another human being in cold blood? | 101.71999999999998 | 139.768125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So I was definitely joking a little bit, obviously, trying to compare between what Donald Trump said about himself and, The sort of explosion, this appetite, this excitement for the conversation Luigi Mangione Started but I do think to call this an act of terrorism is an insult to the intelligence of the American people. Terrorism is something designed to strike fear into the hearts of noncombatants civilians. Right? The general population. Nobody but a tiny class of CEOs has been made to live in fear by Luigi's actions, but nearly everybody knows what it's like to live in fear having a necessary medical claim denied. The fear of having your life ruined, or potentially ended by a stack of medical bills. And I think in a system with so much violence that's direct from the top down, it should come as no surprise when violence begins to boomerang back from the bottom up onto the 1%, Also, I would like to remind you on the subject of terrorism, nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives on night 11. Right? This is the largest terrorist attack this country has ever seen. An estimated 190 1,000 people are murdered each year by our broken health care system. That is the equivalent of 52 9 11s worth of deaths every year. Every single I did. Another 911. Okay. So I gotta ask, who is the pro the more prolific terrorist in this equation? | 106.66000000000001 | 235.858125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Alright. I'm gonna get to Chris' response, but this | 201.79 | 238.758125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | won't | 204.9 | 205.14000000000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | get to anything, even Jamie's points here. I wanna just discuss what something like this means. Having this conversation on a television program. What this means generally? So first, credit to Jamie for being willing to go on and face special, you know, blowback online for making this appearance. To Chris Cuomo for inviting her on. This is where we get to how important conversations like this are. Even if you think Jamie goes too far in, you know, advocating for this legal defense fund, This this conversation is beneficial to a media discourse. People for a long time now have this idea that the left is about, you know, woke scolding, and it's about | 239.448125 | 278.28812500000004 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Forever. | 301.72470697 | 302.074707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | There has been this domination of politics of capitalist politics has been the dominating discourse in mainstream press for the obvious reason that these are run by capitalist organizations. So there's going to be a certain slant when it comes to simply the hiring process And How often do you see a communist invited onto a news network? I can't even think of another example. Maybe at some point it's happened over the past decade or so. I I haven't seen I haven't seen | 302.3947071 | 335.994707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | beneficial to just having to poll or the the the need to poll the conversation back towards a place That is a little more sane. That isn't to say, you know, there are people that are gonna be like, oh, but isn't this just gonna turn people off to the left seeing, someone like Jamie here? You know, advocating or, raising money for Luigi Mangione. But ask yourself, has that hurt Trump? Think of all the focus on Trump and Trump's cult and far right as that hurt him, as that hurt the Republican Party, Clearly, it hasn't. What's ended up happening is by dominating the news cycle, you have people conditioned to thinking in terms of right wing framing. Even if I don't agree with Trump and far right politics, whatever is a little more to the left of that mainstream conservative politics appears to them to be a little more sane because, oh, well, at least not the crazy Trump called. But when you have someone like Jamie on, and more people like this, you know, more communist socialist in a mainstream discussion, it helps to pull discourse back towards the actual center. As right now, all of political discourse is just Branched. In far right, in capitalist politics. And the anger at for profit health care is real. Anger at how much wealth is concentrated at the top in the hands of a few is real. And getting people to know that broadly that's what the left is angry about I think, is a positive thing. Now before I get to the next clip here on what James was discussing, I mean, there's I think there's no doubt that what Luigi Mangione did allegedly did. Is a violent and illegal act. But what for profit health insurance does by putting people in situations where they're denying denied claims is also a violent act. But it's a legally violent act. I think that's the clear distinction there. One act, both acts are violent, but one is illegal, And I think Jamie here is Trying to highlight that How insane it is. That we just all accept that Americans accept that for private health care is normal as perfectly | 301.096582 | 475.114707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | normal | 475.574707 | 475.824707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | for people to be denied healthcare in a time when that should not | 441.756592 | 479.714707 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So | 447.616582 | 447.696582 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it isn't just Jamie who's questioning, by the way, the the terrorism charge. Here's a quick clip from, MSNBC. Also, Questioning. Charge for terrorism. | 447.856582 | 491.564707 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Just questioning the terrorism charge because I I start to worry that you get into a slippery slope by by charging by using the terrorism charge, potentially using an in this way. And I'm I'm maybe I'm wrong, but I just mean that that piqued my interest. | 457.486592 | 505.664707 |
| SPEAKER_4 | And I'd be very it piques my interest too, particularly you and I were discussing during the press conference that not only is it a slippery slope with respect to the use of terrorism charge, but the very use of certain evidence in this case is itself reflective to some of the existence of a police state for kids | 471.666582 | 521.754707 |
| SPEAKER_3 | so much surveillance. | 521.968037 | 522.288037 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Electronic surveillance that been involved here is itself something that concerns many civil libertarians. Yeah. And so you're right to say that this is a concern, and I'll be very curious to see how they attempt to persuade a jury, particularly a Manhattan jury, where Eugene Mangione may have taken on full hero status already that he intended this act not only to kill Brian Thompson himself, but to intimidate others in the course of conduct. | 522.3947069999999 | 551.224707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Katie Turr and her guests there also openly questioning the, application of the terrorism charge in this case. But, Chris Cuomo has a bit of a different perspective. So here's here because we Jamie's response at the beginning, as well as Cuomo has something at the end here. That, I take a little issue with. Well, first of all, as you may know, Jamie, terrorism | 517.9165820000001 | 542.071582 |
| SPEAKER_5 | is a specific legal standard. Right? There's no question that Luigi did what he did in furtherance of a political agenda. He said it Okay? So I don't see this as a question of factor law. It's about the policy behind What I don't understand and you know, you are somebody who in your positions is constantly trying to embrace the humanity of situations. Right? I've been looking at why you support what you do with what's happening in the Middle East conflict. To me, this seems to be anathema to this. You know nothing within a system gets changed by violence. | 542.456582 | 612.9947070000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Alright. The French revolution. The Boston Tea Party, the American Revolutionary War, Stonewall riots, All violent acts that led to big changes. Now you can both condemn and discourage violent acts, and I do, while also understanding the role That violence has played in history against oppressors 4. | 580.276582 | 603.946582 |
| SPEAKER_5 | And that's | 605.436582 | 640.254707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it's always been a reaction to what is already happening to a group of people. You know, it doesn't come out of nowhere. There there was historical context or why people act out when they feel like they are being oppressed or that they represent are being oppressed, he also attempts there to call Jimmy a hypocrite by analogizing Jamie's condemnation of Israel's mass atrocities against Palestinians. To what her reaction should be to Luigi Mangione, which I find to be bizarre. Because | 607.146582 | 641.476582 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Jamie's support for | 641.716582 | 677.064707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Palestinian human rights is born out | 677.064707 | 679.144687 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of | 679.144687 | 679.414707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the oppression of Palestinians at the hand of the Israeli government. Which is why and others are using this moment to speak on the oppression that normal people are facing under a for profit health care system. So I don't think Jamie's being a hypocrite here. I think she's being consistent. But Chris Colm was pulling the whole element of power and who was oppressed, who who the oppressor out of this equation, which doesn't make any sense in the context of what the discussions actually are? Let me get now to the last clip. | 645.106582 | 709.604707 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I want you to understand that I don't think that the energy that you're putting towards backing this guy is getting us to a better place with the problems of the | 675.456582 | 720.5847269999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | system. | 720.804727 | 720.8847069999999 |
| SPEAKER_5 | That's my point to you. Use the money you raised for the people who need it. Not this guy. | 687.376582 | 728.424707 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Well, I believe we really need to treat the causes of problems, rather than merely the symptoms. And I think if you wanna know what kinds of tactics I do advocate for, I think we need a mass movement. You know? Change comes from the bottom up, but not a bottle the way | 695.156602 | 748.334707 |
| SPEAKER_5 | down. | 748.334707 | 748.814707 |
| SPEAKER_3 | And I'm talking about | 715.0665819999999 | 750.6547069999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | mask resist | 751.374707 | 752.254707 |
| SPEAKER_4 | to | 717.946582 | 718.446582 |
| SPEAKER_3 | medical debt. If everybody | 752.814707 | 754.514707 |
| SPEAKER_4 | burns their medical bills, | 754.814707 | 756.274707 |
| SPEAKER_3 | in front of the health insurance offices | 722.0665819999999 | 758.794707 |
| SPEAKER_5 | on Mac. Staffer. | 758.854707 | 759.804707 |
| SPEAKER_3 | That's gonna create change. And we're just trying to figure out how to | 725.656582 | 763.6347069999999 |
| SPEAKER_6 | use this moment this moment of excite of popular excitement has been touched off by, yes, a violent act that I would not advocate for as a tactic, if it were up to the money. But it happened. We're trying to figure out how to ride that wave and move this conversation forward into mass action that can really make a difference. | 729.806602 | 785.454707 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Well, listen. I'm here for | 751.3065819999999 | 787.694677 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it. | 787.694677 | 788.014707 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I always have been, but we're covering it. I would love for that to be the the discussion. But as long as this guy is glamorized, it is a distraction. | 754.346602 | 797.324707 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Alright. Jamie has already succeeded. Because in that clip, you see Chris Cuomo appears to be open to the idea of mass resistance to medical debt. Of burning your medical bills, not paying them off on a mass scale, This is something that I feel like he would not be so open to if the discussion didn't start from why are you raising money for this alleged assassin, But because that's where the conversation began, all of a sudden, when you bring things a little more to you know, to, the center of that, then it appears more reasonable. This is why these sorts of discussions are so important. Having people like having communist socialist on news networks are so important. Because it helps to move the conversation. So great job here from Jamie. And again, credit to Chris Cuomo for having willing to have an honest conversation here. You know, he has a disagreement, and he's voicing it, but he's doing it in the way where he's shouting her down or not hearing her out. He's willing to let her talk. You know, he's allowing her to speak and and make her points. | 763.5765819999999 | 862.9347069999999 |

| SPEAKER_1 | because you incited them, that's the talking point. See? The truth is, though, this is only a fraction of what's happening. Health care is only one aspect What you have to understand is that getting away with unethical behavior directly correlates to how many people you affect. Wrong one person, and you might get away with it. Sure. But those guys who killed my brother-in-law, wronged 1,000,000 and you have a much bigger problem to navigate. When somebody wrongs you, There's a visceral feeling of violation If someone points a gun in your face and takes your wallet, it's a feeling that stays with you for the rest of your life. Coming home and finding that your house has been broken into is a grotesque feeling. Some stranger coming into your life and taking something from you, something that you worked for, can feel like a partial death. And in a way, it is. How many hours, days, or even years of work did it take to purchase that which was stolen from you? In a way, all that time you worked was stolen too. And time is the only thing you truly have in this world. People only tolerate that up until a certain point. And after that point, they become ready, willing, and able to fight for what they have. | 1254.8564589999999 | 1381.5045819999998 |

| SPEAKER_1 | weaponizing young men with fear, I talk about how people have poor risk assessment abilities, how they will irrational irrationally fear things far less likely to happen. Than things far more likely to happen. That applies here as well. In the United States, every year, around $53,000,000,000 is stolen from people. | 155.227553 | 182.727554 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Robberies | 184.067554 | 184.567554 |
| SPEAKER_1 | only account for 0, 3, 4, $1,000,000,000 in means robberies only account for 0.64%. Of what is stolen from Americans per year, That's what you see on the news and on Twitter and what Powell politicians use to sell themselves as the solution for rampant crime. So who on earth is stealing the other 99%? Well, 39.2 $1,000,000,000 of the 52,000,000,000 is what companies steal from their employees. Per year. That's 74%. 74% of the theft the United States per year. Is companies stealing from their employees? That's minimum wage violations overtime violations, | 185.617553 | 244.947557 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Nonetheless. Imagine | 324.14661197 | 326.19661199999996 |
| SPEAKER_1 | 20 of those violent summers every year. Not in commercial districts, but in neighborhoods. That's the material cost affecting us. It does not happen with a crowbar or a molotov. It happens. With a pen. You know what's even more infuriating? That 40,000,000,000 is pennies Pennies compared to what else | 326.99661199999997 | 354.466612 |
| SPEAKER_0 | is | 354.466612 | 354.70661199999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | stolen from you. But it's not included in the statistics because technically, it cannot be class | 354.70661199999995 | 361.676612 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Political campaign. And it could be dark money, meaning that they didn't have to report it. This is, of course, how your government is bought. Incidentally, insurance company packs donated 23 $1,000,000,000 to candidates in 2024. What's interesting is that before this decision was made, It was at | 458.19885700000003 | 481.658857 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Skyrocketed and just enough money was given to Democrats to make them ineffective They started giving a hell of a lot of money away. So what were they getting in return? 100 of 1,000,000,000 of dollars in so subsidies Their investment paid off quite well for them. Not only do they make record profits, but they get tons of your tax dollars because the corporations and the government are working together like the mob. If you don't play ball, then they fund your political opponent and get them in our Slip | 566.4591741 | 603.709174 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and return, they deregulate and send you tons of subsidies that result market advantage that is about as far as you can get from free market capitalism as you could possibly imagine. Yet they want you to believe that anyone who has hardcore communist, un American, or anti business. It's ridiculous red scare tactics. Get the regular people to fight among themselves Cause people to complain about the inner city mother of 5 getting food stamps and money for rent which causes people to call her a welfare queen while billions of your tax dollars are being siphoned off to the robber barons that are literally destroying your children's futures. And just like the pedo who cries pedo, they also cry about the dangers of wealth redistribution. Redistribution while conducting the most massive wealth redistribution that has ever occurred complete with too big to fail bailouts, which are more aptly described as handouts. Privatize the profits, socialize the losses, This is reverse Robinhood on a massive scale. But cheap energy is good. Right? It helps everyone, doesn't it? We need oil, don't we? It's included in so many products. Look. The only reason we supposedly need as much oil as we do. Is because our society was built around needing the oil industry. We built an incredibly inefficient society around cars rather than people. So we need to commute everywhere. Wasting 1,000,000,000 of dollars and years of our lives. Because of the world that was built for us to inhabit. A concrete world of planned obsolescence, deliberate inefficiencies, and complete reliance on those who made it this way. It's like giving your doctor a baseball bat and letting him beat the shit out of you so that you need him to keep you alive. That's what we're doing right now. It's lunacy. But this is the world in which we were raised. So it feels normal to us. In truth, it makes no sense for us. It makes perfect sense for them though. For the few It's an advanced form of widespread robbery. You are living in the midst of the empire that has ever existed. And you are being robbed Entry single k. Not by the poor, but by the wealthy. I'm not talking about people who aren't merely well lost, not your rich uncle. Not your doctor. And not the small business owner who makes a good living. It's done by the people and companies with enough wealth to buy countries. The only reason it's not called criminal is because they paid off the people who make the laws. The criminals made it legal to do crime and you are the victim. You're the mark. You just don't know it. Because it wasn't done with a gun or a knife. It was done with the stroke. Of a pen. So it looks so civilized. What's the result of all this? Well, the result is a massive hoarding of wealth. 80 percent of our country, 80 percent. S 7 percent of the wealth The top 10% have 70 percent of the wealth much of that being concentrated in the top 1%. That's not the result of a meritocracy. That's not a fair and free market at work. That is the result | 565.581049 | 865.4591740000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | $1,000. If every single one of them had a $1,000 emergency expense right it would amount to $200,000,000,000 which is less than half of what Elon Musk alone has. But didn't he make money from electric cars which are better in terms of climate change? Well, Musk made much of his money by selling carbon credits. So that other companies can pollute more He essentially turned Tesla into a pollution company | 899.177684 | 933.3476840000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | bottom line is that our entire country is a store that's being looted and it's almost empty. We got 7% left. And they're not going to leave that on the table either. That's not the nature of greed. Cancer is not rational. If it were, then it wouldn't kill you. It would grow just enough so that you could keep living. And thus the cancer could keep living too. But that's not how cancer works. And greed is like cancer. They will just keep taking and taking until it kills our society. I could show you some graphs like the ones in this older video. Here's that ideal we asked everyone about. Something like this curve. | 898.669559 | 987.557688 |
| SPEAKER_2 | This isn't too bad. We've got some incentive as the wealthiest folks are now about | 953.599554 | 992.637684 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Middle class is certainly struggling more than they were while the rich and wealthy are making roughly a 100 times that of the poorest Americans, and about 10 times that of the still healthy middle class. | 1041.9286009999998 | 1053.1886009999998 |

| SPEAKER_0 | So, yeah, my mom is doing fine as well. Alright. So let's see what this was. Is it cutie talking, Hassan on the naughty or nice shit? List. It | 0 | 9.959999999999999 |

| SPEAKER_0 | When I was a little kid, sometimes my grandfather would talk about World War 2 He said everyone was so happy when Germany finally started getting | 67.276361 | 79.331362 |
| SPEAKER_1 | doing to and to so many others, I always saw my grandfather as such a good and honest man. A man of Great. Integrity. A piece Loving man, yet he was happy. About such widespread violence, indiscriminately blanketing an entire populace with fire. And fury. But consider the context of his time, Consider what the Nazis had done up until then, what they put people through and the only tools we had to stop it. When faced with great injustice, even the best will turn to violence Even the best of us will be glad for violence. That's what I don't want it to come to. You should do everything in your power to avoid the in which violence becomes necessary. Because only then, only when all peaceful avenues have been exhausted Can violence be justified? And that's a hell of a thing because violence is ugly. We have a natural revulsion to it. It takes a lot of Anger, | 42.748236999999996 | 127.83823699999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Can be cloaked by a labyrinth of bureaucracy. But that only works for so long before people start to understand who is really affecting their lives and why. Propaganda has limits and can only material reality up into a certain point. You can't rely on that forever. At a societal level, those with the real responsibility to avoid avoid violence lie not with the people with the powerful. Those with power can freely choose | 200.758514 | 236.568514 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the results are quite different. You have the power to take it all. But the world that would result from that is not a world | 200.240389 | 244.648514 |
| SPEAKER_0 | you | 210.580389 | 210.90038900000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | would wanna live in. During the full 100 years of 20th century, there were 360 school shootings in the United States, We are still in the Q1 of the 21st century in yet so far in the 21st century, there have been 5 and 75 school shootings already far more than the entirety of the 20th century. Now some of these school shooters were inspired by each other and copied each other. Yet they were all universally hated Everyone was disgusted by what they did. They were seen as monsters. Soon it became anathema to even speak their names They terrified regular people, people like myself, as I have a Even if I didn't, though, I would still be horrified by it. Everybody knows that children don't deserve to be killed. Well, most of us know that. Yet despite how hated Those killers were. It kept happening. And now it happens more than ever before. So here's a hypothetical for you. If it can become a trend to commit an act of violence, that makes you hated, Can it become a trend to commit an act of violence that makes you beloved? It seems to me like that's at least possible if not likely. And I say that without moral judgment of my own. I'm not advocating it. I'm the examining it. It's the for consideration. There are around 20 1,000 murders per year. The United States. Of course, you don't hear about the vast majority of them. People like my brother-in-law who fought back against a couple of muggers and was shot ahead for it. I believe they got away with about 20 dollars. There was a single paragraph about it, and did not seem to care all that much. To them, it was boring. Routine. It was as if they already knew the killers would never become but it's a very different story when someone of note. What I saw among the general public recently after the shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO Was quite unprecedented. The media tried to condemn it, and some tried to twist it into partisan politics, but that did not seem to work. Neither right nor left mattered. People were united across the borders spectrum, which is a neutral, but as that devious spectrum itself exists to divide us and to keep us fighting amongst ourselves rather than for our own self interests. It's exceedingly proficient at pitting us against each other. But for a moment, out of the countless shootings in this country, there was actually one that most of the public at the very least, did not mind. Regardless of political affiliation. It was a unification of sentiment I had not seen since the killing of Osama bin Laden and he was guilty of an act of terrorism that 3,000 lives. What if your death had a similar reaction? That's a hell of a thing, isn't it? Imagine millions of people either celebrating your death or at the very least not minding it. It's a scary thought. I would imagine that it's at least disconcerting for the peers of that CEO, especially as they try to live in a society that cheers on his pillar. A society that is more heavily armed than ever before. I fear that his peers will take away the exact wrong message which will be the status quo plus more security. To the peers of that scene, I don't want to see you be killed. I don't even want there to be a death penalty. | 245.208514 | 542.418514 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Brian Thompson was a wouldn't know. But what they do know what the company he worked for does, and that's all they need to know. So it's not even about personal hatred. That CEO could have been anybody. It was what he represented that matter. Was what he agreed to do in his profession. That angered every day regular people When your chosen profession affects the lives of millions of people, | 573.5624839999999 | 608.1924839999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But what if your profession itself makes ethical behavior impossible? Well, then nobody should be doing it in the first place. And the mere act of doing it becomes an indictment. What if more people died because of you than because of Bin Laden? Not because of any sort of ideological hatred, not because of explicit, highly visible violence like flying planes into buildings, but merely because it's part of doing business. A stroke of the pen. It's so much more civil Isn't it? It allows you to pretend that you have the moral high ground We have the ability to save your life. But somebody else's pen said no. We have the ability to stop No. It may seem ridiculous to compare that to Nazis and jihadists, but the only real difference is in their reasons. They're all overseers of pain. Suffering and death. Some do it because of hatred, while others do it for profit. It's nothing personal to them. But, of course, to you, it's the most personality it can be. It your fight. In the end, though, no matter how someone dies, the fact that they died curious 10 days after the UnitedHealthcare CEO was killed, So The billionaire founder of the Mango Fashion Company died in a hiking accident. Be described as sad. What's going on here? Did these commenters know that man? Did they wake up feeling wronged by that man? Did they even know his name before that day? Probably not. What he did do however, was accumulate 1,000,000,000 of dollars during a time when many of us are struggling. That's with those who did not care about his death. Understood. Now some people will mistake that for envy. But that's far too simplistic. It's okay to be rich and successful, but the degree and the content Text. Matters. If a lion was gorging himself on a buffalo carcass, and swatted away the other members of his pride. That would not be an accurate analogy to describe what's currently going on in our society to accurate describe it. The pride would have to be on the brink of starvation and the greedy lion would have to be hoarding 1,000 of buffalo carcasses, more than he could ever eat and swatting the pride away from all of those carcasses nonetheless. And if the pride should kill their own buffalo, then the lion would take it. And add it to his forbidden mountain of carcassins. We would immediately recognize the absurdity of such a lion. We would not try to defend it as an ambition or admirable in any way. It's only partially about health care, you see. That's what others need to understand. I'll get into that shortly. But as far as health care goes, for the longest time, we were made to believe bad and expensive health care with insured company battles. Was just a part of reality. And that it was unrealistic to expect otherwise. It was fantasy to live in a world where you could receive quality health care and not be charged a lot of money for it. But then the Internet happened, and the world got a lot smaller. A lot more connected. And we started hearing about how other countries have free health care. So then they started arguing that it's not exactly free because they have to pay for it in their taxes. But as it turns out, it would be less expensive to pay for it through your taxes than through a below greedy middleman that can base your medical care on their profits. It's fully understood that a person with limited means can easily be discouraged from and even incapable of legally challenging a massive corporation, especially while going through serious medical issues After all, such corporations are bigger than any of us. They're quasi governments. Even though they're not alive, they're classified as people. But everyone understands that's a legal fiction. To protect the people behind them. Some of you watching this video make around $30,000 a year or less. The CEO of UnitedHealthcare made 30,000 dollars a day. His job was to determine the best possible ways to choose money over stopping pain, suffering, and death. For that, he made $30,000 a day. He did not die while attending a patient's meeting He died while attending an investor meeting. Those close to him defended him by claiming that indeed there are problems with the way we do health insurance. In this country but that's not his fault. They say. It's the systems Nobody forced him to do that job, though. And nobody forced that particular company to be the very worst offender of the system. You can't be the very best at profit. Profiting off the system and then claim to wish the system were different. That's an obvious lie. And if the very people in charge of this system can't be blamed, then who can be? They're the reason health care is so expensive and first place. The CEO of the parent company of UnitedHealthcare's said that he's super proud to be part of an organization that does so much good for so many. Every one of us regular people recognizes that as PR bullshit. It couldn't be further from the truth. He also said this, And we make sure that care is safe, appropriate, | 573.214359 | 1056.2824839999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | and is delivered when people need it. And we go against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex. Ultimately unsustainable. So we're gonna continue to make that case. We will continue to do the work we do I encourage you to tune out that critical noise that we're hearing right now. And what we know to be true Is needs a company like UnitedHealth Group and it needs people like Brian within it, | 1022.694359 | 1099.022484 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Now consider the context of that quote. First of all, insurance companies have no business making medical decisions. To decide what's necessary And second of all, UnitedHealth Group makes record profits every single year. While Americans struggle More and more. Every single year I don't wanna hear about his version of unsustainability. What he really means is that the level of profit margin that they currently enjoy would be unsustainable. So people are going to have to be sacrificed on that altar. The altar of sustained high profits. That's what he really means. And the news media flooded us with puff pieces about how wonderful this other CEO, Brian Thompson, was and how the positive reaction to his death was appalling but was only a fringe few That's a lie.

Though I would not celebrate his death or anyone else's death, I don't really blame people who do. They've been through worse than I have. You can't expect them to be emotionless robots emotionless, like the people who seal their fates with the stroke of a pen. That may look civil it's anything but. In this CBS piece, it says that at an investor meeting last year, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare a value based care. To keep patients healthy rather than focusing on treating them when they get sick. CEOs love lying to investors. I'm fully covered under UnitedHealthcare. This year, after I got flu shots for my whole family, you know what else I got? | 1065.8843590000001 | 1228.102484 |

How dare you? That's what they're really telling you. Take it and be polite about it. | 1255.05458198 | 1288.044582 |

| SPEAKER_2 | is the problem. This is their problem. | 707.7499799999999 | 743.8382049999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | If we have any kind of argument or something's weird, whatever it is you don't understand, | 715.0400799999999 | 753.8681049999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | You don't | 722.7799799999999 | 757.8281049999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | come you don't seek to understand. You just wanna stop fighting and it's just like a thing where If something is, like, Is something is out of place where you do something and I pointed out like yesterday when you putting the fuses and something, and I just said, give me those or whatever I said. Like, don't put those in there. I mean, I said what I said it in the way I did because They didn't go there and I mean whether or not you knew or not either way that was not where they went. That's not where I wanted them. Whatever it was. It doesn't matter, like, I wasn't rude to you, but the fact that, like, You had an explanation for doing it as a means for me being, like, unjustifiably, like, | 724.25988 | 809.823105 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I don't even know. I mean, it wasn't even a big deal whatsoever. Like, why you even | 776.95988 | 815.4381050000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | had to say anything at all? Were just, like, blew my mind as to how it became a thing of, like, | 781.12998 | 822.278105 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that even that big of something you'd be mad about? You're right. I wasn't mad about it, but now you're telling me that I | 788.20998 | 827.6381050000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | had, like, you telling me that me is I mean, I don't even know. What do I what what should I have said? Anyways, Like you put them in there, I don't like I was putting them somewhere else whatever. You know I was sat here and I was I did all of that for you. I mean, literally all you had to do is just be like, oops whatever. I don't know. So it's just nothing. You didn't have to say anything at all. I wasn't mad at you at all. I didn't, like, wasn't blaming you. It wasn't anything. But the fact that you explained, well, there's already so many here. What did I whatever. Like, I mean, I don't know, like, why Like, what the like, because the bottom line is you did do something that I didn't want you to do. And they didn't go there. You kinda messed up whatever the whatever. It | 827.6381050000001 | 875.8281049999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | wasn't even big deal. It was just that | 875.8281049999999 | 878.0981049999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | well, I mean, will you even own that you put something in the wrong place? Even not even knowing? It's like like not knowing? Is that okay even? Like, is that something you can handle? Like, me telling you, like, hey. I'm putting these over here already. I already have a spot for those. Is that okay for me to say? Like, there's nothing wrong. You didn't do anything wrong whatsoever. At all. Like, but I Me in the, like, moment, you know I just did all that for you. You know I did all of that for you. So me in the moment, just having this like these over here, whatever, like I mean, there's nothing that, like, to | 844.0299799999999 | 916.9081050000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | even | 916.9081050000001 | 917.278105 |
| SPEAKER_4 | like, I was not mad at all. There was nothing I wasn't mad about it. I mean, I made a, like, my tone of voice was like, oh, he's over here kind of thing, but that was because I mean, it wasn't anything serious at all. Like, there's nothing like I | 882.96998 | 896.89998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | made | 932.1680050000001 | 932.6680050000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I don't know how I would have asked you, like, considering the fact that, like, I did do all that for you, and I don't know. | 900.0799800000001 | 943.1880050000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Don't know. Either way, | 909.18998 | 944.8281049999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | But the point | 910.67998 | 945.788005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | was | 945.788005 | 945.8681049999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | that We got that turned into a bigger fight because I said that you said or because you made it, like I was being unreasonable or I was overreacting. That's what I said. | 945.8681049999999 | 958.268105 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Even | 958.268105 | 958.508105 |
| SPEAKER_3 | though | 958.508105 | 958.708105 |
| SPEAKER_4 | you didn't say those words, what we were fighting about was because I said that you made it seem like I was overreacting, telling me I'm overreacting to something. Again, which you always do. Anytime you say, it's not the big of a deal, you're getting mad about nothing, doesn't matter if I'm mad. I don't care about the fucking semantics of the word you use. It is the fact that my emotion, whatever it is, is to you too much because whatever it is, it doesn't matter. Okay? Care if you ever said those words. That is not the point. When you do that, you're literally dismissing what I'm saying. You're dismissing the whole, like, I don't care what word you're using. I'm | 958.708105 | 996.597905 |
| SPEAKER_2 | not gonna argue with you and say I'm not mad even if I'm not mad. | 996.597905 | 999.498105 |
| SPEAKER_4 | It is the fact that you're saying that any emotion I feel I'm not saying, I do have a right to be mad because most of them, I'm not mad about it. It at all, but you just acting like it's not a big deal at all because you don't wanna deal with whatever emotion I'm feeling or me saying that I, like that no. Don't do that. Like, the most simple thing. Like, no, no, do that or no, give me this or hey, I was doing this this way, like that the most simple thing, and you just being like, it's either like it's either response like you explain yourself or my bad as if, like, what the fuck? Like, it's | 965.42998 | 1031.958205 |
| SPEAKER_2 | not that big of a deal. Like, why you always we're not against | 1031.958205 | 1035.008105 |
| SPEAKER_4 | other. No. No. Plea I mean, yes. You can. Wait. Please. Do not and do not explain yourself, | 1000.69998 | 1042.1881050000002 |
| SPEAKER_0 | please. | 1042.1881050000002 | 1042.6881050000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I want you to acknowledge how I feel in those moments and why why it puts us against each other? That's what I want you to like, to think about. I don't want you to explain why you do it. There's no reason why you do because it gets us into fights. So there's no good reason for doing it. I'm not doing anything wrong to you in that moment. I don't know how I tell you something as simple as I'm putting these over here, without it being a thing where like you're getting defensive about it. | 1008.8499800000001 | 1080.0681049999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But | 1052.2799799999998 | 1052.6499800000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | that was one one instance of this happening. And then the same night last night was the thing I got mad about. I Was that I said something about the guy his comment in the beginning or whatever. And I was talking about, like, I don't know. I just said something and he said, well, I think he was being facetious and you were explaining whatever. And I explained to you that that's what I was talking about too, and so I reiterated what I had said to show you the connection between, like, I was talking about that too. We weren't talking about 2 different things. Like, or whatever. And you're like, instead of just being like, oh, okay. I get it now. Okay. Yeah. Didn't get it at first. Whatever. Or I wasn't listening. I don't know. Whatever. It was a thing of instead of it just being like that because we were in need talking about the | 1053.3698800000002 | 1143.9981050000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | same part. | 1143.9981050000001 | 1144.5481049999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I was pointing that out. That's | 1110.2399799999998 | 1145.758105 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it. | 1145.758105 | 1146.198105 |
| SPEAKER_4 | You said to me that you're, like, okay. And Like, Like, that's fine. I already said like, instead of just saying that, you went into this whole, like, thing where, okay, mean, I get it. And, like, I get it. Why are you telling me? I'm, | 1112.5299799999998 | 1163.6731049999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like, | 1163.6731049999999 | 1163.7781049999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I'm telling you again because you said I was wrong about, like, the part you were talking about. You said I was wrong. Those were my words, not yours. Did it change the meaning of what I'm saying whatsoever? The point I'm trying to make? No. But you hyper focus on that. | 1129.5499799999998 | 1176.5681049999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So that is what we were fighting about. That was what I was pissed about was because | 1142.45998 | 1180.6281049999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | this whole thing where you're just acting like I'm getting mad about nothing when it's like, no, Brian, is literally because you get | 1147.0400799999998 | 1187.0681049999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | defensive about the most simple thing | 1187.0681049999998 | 1189.638105 |
| SPEAKER_4 | and you focus on this thing where like like it's it's like well, I didn't say those words. I mean, I didn't say those like, oh my god. No. You didn't, but it doesn't matter if you said those words. That's not the point I'm making. You did say I was wrong by saying that we weren't talking about the same part. That I misunderstood you. That's saying I'm wrong, but you said you twist yourself in like this knot trying to explain yourself a way, | 1155.72998 | 1215.508105 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like explain | 1215.7281050000001 | 1216.1281049999998 |
| SPEAKER_4 | or not explain because then you at the point where you have nothing else to say. But, yeah, it's the same thing as saying you're wrong, basically. You're not wrong for saying | 1182.2199799999999 | 1223.638105 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that. Look, | 1189.8900800000001 | 1224.7781049999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | anything you will not say that, you will get a Jesus fucking Christ. And then that's it. That's it. Like, you cannot, like, why it gets to that just from, like, but you know you tied yourself in this knot. I'm not trying to do this to you. I don't want you to be defensive. I don't want you to think I'm attacking you. I'm not. | 1190.8999800000001 | 1245.0881049999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Recently because I'm just I'm over it. I shouldn't do it, and I'm sorry. | 1347.661329 | 1351.041329 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Shit. Mhmm. | 521.0001 | 526.04 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It's crazy. I don't know. I mean, I don't know what brand this is. Obviously, I don't think that any piece of clothing, like, especially something like that should be worth a $115, but whatever. It's not actually worth. It just depends on how people will pay for it, but but I have a feeling that that's, like, one of those things | 526.8399999999999 | 587.268125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 553.06 | 553.56 |
| SPEAKER_1 | don't know. I I really can't see any reasonable person spending that much money on that at all, but whatever. Feel like it's one of those things that Wait. | 588.328125 | 569.1199999999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 569.1199999999999 | 569.6199999999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | forgot what I was saying. I forgot what I was saying | 603.9881250000001 | 605.5080249999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | because | 605.5080249999999 | 605.641425 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I got confused by what I was doing. I feel like it's like some sort of thing that they have that's priced really high, but they don't actually charge for it. They really more so give it out for free for different, like, different, like, events. I don't know how to explain it but different promotional things that they're like, oh, | 605.641425 | 633.1481249999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | get the free | 633.1481249999999 | 633.638125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | onesie that's priced at a $115. You're normally a $115 or something like that. But they just have it priced like that on the tags so people think that they're getting something of value. And it's free anyway, so why not? But I don't how the it depends, I guess, on how everything else is priced in there. And that's a good place. Seems pretty lame. I mean, there's nothing, like, spectacular about that fucking thing. I | 633.638125 | 630.3499999999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | mean, it's pretty. Pretty warm and soft and cozy. | 664.6581249999999 | 667.6481249999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. But it looks silly, and what the hell | 633.9001000000001 | 671.3981249999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It | 637.6699999999998 | 637.8299999999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | looks silly like, | 672.138125 | 673.2581250000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I miss | 673.2581250000001 | 673.858125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, I'm okay with silly wouldn't be silly. It's okay for looking I don't like, looking silly is not the problem. Being paying a $115 to look silly is the problem. And then the the religious part of it or the | 639.79 | 688.1981249999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | The very, | 654.315 | 656.21 |

| SPEAKER_1 | the missing green? | 234.27808500000003 | 235.178085 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You mean the | 200.86996 | 236.15308500000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | icon? Yeah. | 236.15308500000003 | 203.52996000000007 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Do you | 203.68996000000004 | 238.318085 |
| SPEAKER_1 | mean? Well, like, I I found them Ready. But now since they had already been found, | 238.318085 | 243.88808500000005 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But shouldn't that be used for something where that there's actually a more use for all the Space. I mean, the | 209.88995999999997 | 249.91808500000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | smaller There's still, like, a lot more electronics, I should. Like, I was gonna put all the light bulbs in here. Like, those are electrical. Like, | 249.91808500000002 | 259.188085 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But there's not that many cubbies in there. | 225.13995999999997 | 261.688085 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, we're gonna separate them by light bulbs and put all the light bulbs in one section | 228.01995999999997 | 266.3580850000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. | 232.53992000000005 | 233.03992000000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Because, like, I don't have enough light bulbs. Of each different light bulb to Have you tried both of those on the section? Tipsy, go lay down, dude. Go. No. Not this way. Go. Well, | 234.12995999999998 | 252.78992000000005 |
| SPEAKER_0 | since I might have had some sort of, like, of an idea, maybe you might be curious just to | 253.39996000000008 | 293.49808500000006 |
| SPEAKER_2 | see what I | 293.49808500000006 | 293.97804500000007 |
| SPEAKER_0 | was going with. What what did | 293.97804500000007 | 295.09804500000007 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you have in mind? | 295.09804500000007 | 296.23808500000007 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I mean, | 262.30996000000005 | 297.50808500000005 |
| SPEAKER_0 | you really wanna know? | 266.32996 | 301.59804500000007 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I have Yes. | 301.59804500000007 | 302.23808500000007 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. I really wanna know. | 302.23808500000007 | 303.908085 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But you only asked | 270.15996000000007 | 305.50808500000005 |
| SPEAKER_2 | them. | 305.50808500000005 | 305.5880850000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | No. Babe, I want to know. Please tell | 305.5880850000001 | 308.14808500000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | me. | 308.14808500000004 | 308.408085 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I was thinking that it would be most beneficial the first, like, its universality. So the light bulbs would all go together, but necessarily with the electrical stuff that you use on all kinds of things. Right? That's what I was thinking. And, I mean, they could just go in a container where you don't cause you don't always need them when you need that. So you need those things. But those things also aren't numerous enough to tick up to make use of that thing as much And also, it just depends on what you need to be mobile or not mostly, I guess. So I don't know, like, what kinds of tools you use with those necessarily. Not all of the tools you use with that stuff. But I have an idea on some of it. I mean, I had questions, like, for Like, you to answer more so so I could figure out, like, what things went with what, but they should be grouped or like, proved or categorized based on their general usage or their specific usage. Tipsy. Nope. Tipsy, go. | 276.78996000000006 | 382.7980550000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Go go down, dude. Goddamn. | 382.7980550000001 | 384.658085 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Water? Like, gee. Mingo potty? What? | 354.9899300000001 | 391.61808500000006 |
| SPEAKER_2 | You | 391.61808500000006 | 391.698085 |
| SPEAKER_1 | have | 391.698085 | 391.8580850000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | water? | 391.8580850000001 | 392.3580850000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You do have it, sir. Sorry. You're annoying. Like, section or, like, spot. | 359.42996000000005 | 405.658085 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And | 375.15996000000007 | 375.18996000000004 |
| SPEAKER_0 | like, anything that's, like, specific for the Subaru that doesn't go with anything else doesn't need to end with other things. I don't think. Because that just makes things hard to find and also, like, if you're going to work on stuff for the Subaru and you need those things, then you take those things or whatever or you have those things easily, like, to be mobile. To go do that, I guess. Or wherever. And that's just in general, I guess. Your Jeep stuff should be with Jeep stuff, I think. Mean, I don't think you have that many, like, Jeep parts, but so I mean, it could be that the Subaru and Jeep stuff are together, but, like, sort of separate. I don't know. But they don't need to be intertwined with the general stuff that you have that are, like, consumables and that you use for just like, you can use for multiple different, like, things. But | 375.66992000000005 | 423.41996000000006 |
| SPEAKER_2 | so | 425.0999600000001 | 425.5999600000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I mean, you said you had enough of these to fill up all 4 of those things. Or more of them more than that to fill up all of those things. | 425.83996000000013 | 466.308085 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And a lot more than | 432.3028600000001 | 468.12528499999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | this | 468.12528499999996 | 468.4280850000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, in my room. Yeah. Sex and then, like, still have more fucking nuts and bolts and shit. In the fucking in the Subaru, like, the fucking the Ford board is full. Yeah. Of fucking nuts and bolts and shit. | 434.68006 | 482.59808499999997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So | 449.08996000000013 | 449.53995999999995 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yeah. So | 451.29995999999994 | 486.4280850000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | this is a good thought. Well, I don't know. I think you need to put everything in one spot anyways, like, before you even try to organize it because you don't even know how space you have unless you are willing or already planning on getting rid of a bunch of stuff, which | 454.8899600000001 | 502.328085 |
| SPEAKER_2 | maybe. | 469.06006000000014 | 469.56006000000014 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Mean, at least the stuff that's like dirty and kind of messed up that you would have to fix first before being able to use or something That's Mhmm. Like, right? Or super rusted or something that you know you never actually gonna use because you have newer ones anyways. Right? | 470.65996000000007 | 519.348185 |
| SPEAKER_0 | What do you want, Sajid? Go go right now. | 495.80995999999993 | 531.9380850000001 |

| SPEAKER_1 | like, there's I know I don't know what it's like to be black bit being black is not a feeling. It's just the color of your skin. So, like, yeah. You're right. I mean, they're right. Whatever. But when people say this, I feel like it it creates a thing where what people can't possibly understand people to empathize with with black people than in a way. It's just kinda like no. We're all human beings, and we know what it would like, we just put ourselves in their shoes imagine what it's like to be, like, talked about as if you're animals. Or have to be scared of you as if, like, you're, like, or being told, like, you're super pregnant. And just being, like, I don't know. Always scared me in the legs. Get sent to prison for the rest of your life for being a statistic, you know. I don't know. I just feel like saying it's not I know it's not possible, so I cannot possibly ever face any kind of, like, uncertainty or just the the pool tee and just any of that. Right. You're right. I don't know what it's like in that sense. But to say, like, that I don't like, then I'll never know what it's like to be black but of course not. No. I I don't know, but that's also not as not really something you know. What does it feel like to be black? Nothing. It feels this I mean, nothing, but if all of the things that come along with it. Those are feelings. Those things you have to | 0 | 178.838122 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. | 179.478122 | 179.87811200000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's that's I think that's that's what I said. Take him for saying it's like yeah. Like, it's not it's not just like black. It's the fucking stigma. Like, I'll never know what it's like to be a woman and be potentially fearful of men and what they might try and do to me in a dark alley. Okay. Trying to shit. Right. It just just just just hear me out. Put you Fuckin'. I will never know that. | 179.87811200000002 | 234.00812200000001 |

| SPEAKER_2 | like I | 266.608122 | 267.008122 |
| SPEAKER_1 | could | 267.008122 | 267.508122 |
| SPEAKER_2 | know. It's I can I can I can think I can feel it, but, like, when it comes down to it, The trial walks through a dark Kelly, I'm more worried about getting sucked stabbed, robbed, or whatever? I'm not thinking about a man fucking takes his member fucking shove it in me type shit. I will I will know what that's like. I will never know what that's like. Unless in the 1 and 1,000,000,000 of chance it happens or whatever. I will never know that with that fear is like | 233.92999700000001 | 334.138122 |

You would never know that exact feeling in or that exact type of sphere. But it if you can imagine or if you have ever felt fear at all, then you can empathize You can understand, and then therefore, just imagine you being scared.

| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, I but I don't know how to explain it. Obviously, no. Because I might. I don't get those same kind same kind of, like, discrimination. But I but you can't say but I I would never say that but I can't imagine what it would feel like, | 462.950017 | 532.388122 |
| SPEAKER_2 | though, | 532.528122 | 533.028122 |
| SPEAKER_1 | because, I, like, I know that would suck, and I would fucking hate it. So I don't understand that takes how you could say that you don't know. Like, | 499.379997 | 549.928122 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Would get me different treatment than my being black does get me | 505.13977200000005 | 514.629772 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yes. That would just be the fact that you're not just painted as good or bad. Instead of good or good or whatever. By default or being the team. Default. But why is just the default? what does that do? | 516.869771 | 551.628122 |
| SPEAKER_2 | There's a difference or there's, like, I can imagine this versus | 551.688122 | 526.299997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Great. | 528.029997 | 528.529997 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I actually feel this, like, fucking negative by, just saying the fucking a white person they would have they would have to imagine the feeling that a black person would have | 529.159997 | 600.418122 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. Maybe if you would say this, it's I didn't know what you're saying. I'm No. Actually, no. Still | 566.769997 | 614.248122 |
| SPEAKER_0 | kind | 614.248122 | 614.628122 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of no because I get it. No. We don't actually we're not in your shoes because the color of your skin makes all these things a reality for you. So now I've I don't have black kids, so no. I can't possibly know. What it's like to have black skin and fit like, deal with the the fucking societal, like, stigma with that. Like, but That's regardless. I don't understand the point in saying this is, like so, like, saying this to me after, like, I'm saying | 581.279997 | 668.758122 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that | 636.209997 | 636.709997 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't need to have black skinned. Do understand that that's not okay. The whole point in saying that you don't know what it's like or why people never know is | 639.019997 | 686.508122 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that | 686.508122 | 687.008122 |
| SPEAKER_1 | because there are some white people who deny it. Whatsoever, like, completely. | 653.409997 | 693.198122 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Just just like | 570.0397720000001 | 571.749772 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the racial, you know, interracial relationships aren't as stigmatized as they are. But as you know, from, like, the fucking fucking work. | 505.12164700000005 | 557.499769 |
| SPEAKER_0 | No. I | 523.63165 | 558.739774 |
| SPEAKER_1 | know. They they they still are stigmatized by ignorant motherfuckers. That you know, fucking got got it from the fence that fucking got it from their parents, but call them. And it's like, But And it's like it's just | 558.739774 | 584.8097660000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | the churn and stuff. | 584.8097660000001 | 586.329772 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But, yeah, It's not it's not it's not the fucking there is a difference between white and black because we are all the fucking same. But it's a the history that goes with the ignorance in this country So whenever fucking whenever, like, like, when I was in Maryland and shit, Like, before I was any fucking sort of criminal like, at all, I was fucking that way, I don't know. It was just like I could walk in the store with my with my wife, friends, and fucking eyes would be on me. | 586.329772 | 661.659772 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Of course. | 628.671647 | 663.7997720000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Solely me. Yeah. Of course. You know what I mean? And My wife, they did fucking They didn't they didn't know what the fuck the deal was. Like, they didn't know even notice the shit was happening. Yeah. | 664.099772 | 690.549762 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I mean | 657.671647 | 692.639762 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, | 692.889772 | 693.389772 |
| SPEAKER_0 | They were told that there is no such thing as racism anymore. | 664.861647 | 703.509772 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That's that's that's a microcosm of what what I got from him saying that fucking wife is gonna walk little little bit more towards me and put the plug. And, unfortunately, my wife friends will never know that ceiling. Where it's like you just walk in the place You can be fucking buying nice clothes this year. That's Not even fucking working, like, a hoodlobe or what the fuck every, you know, | 670.151657 | 768.7897720000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But if you're not aware, then | 735.271647 | 771.429752 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you | 771.429752 | 771.929752 |
| SPEAKER_0 | don't know. Like, I | 738.051647 | 774.2197920000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I | 774.359772 | 774.5197720000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | wouldn't have known, like, being a kid, I wouldn't have recognized that or known my, one of my friends, some of those black weight was having that kind of pressure, that kind of like, you know, and that I wasn't or just whatever. But now that I am aware of this kind of stuff, Like, I would still I would feel it if I was walking in with you and you were being watched or something like that. Why wouldn't I feel it? Why wouldn't I know? Or be like | 774.5197720000001 | 820.669772 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But like, yes, You you be able to feel it. You'd be able to observe it, but you wouldn't you wouldn't know what it would like, | 820.989772 | 835.679772 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I don't know. I guess what I'm not getting is that I feel like you're trying to say or that you are saying I know you're saying that we can't like, I can't literally feedback and experience these things. Like, I know this. But to say that I can't see it and know what it feels like or like, is the is is contrary to how human emotions and empathy works. This is the thing that is, like, that's the only reason why we care about some to save somebody who's hurting or whatever. Is because we can put ourselves in that in that pain and imagine how they feel. You know? So to say, like, you can't know what it feels like is I've it's feel like it's a simplification that doesn't do any justice. And actually kind of makes people not do anything at all. In a way. Because they if we're if we're The 5 year old told you can't possibly know then what the fuck? Then why should we do try? We can't possibly know. We don't know what it's like. Email? I I don't know. | 807.031667 | 955.929752 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I see what you're saying. But, like, I I don't I don't know fucking how to put it in the fucking words. Like, I I just | 925.811627 | 978.5797520000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Citizens. It was like a Okay. Exactly. So the fact that that's where they I mean, maybe maybe, sis, Maybe, like, I do get what you're saying. Like, I can't I don't know what it's like to feel that the and to live with that kind of pressure or that kind of, like, constant, like | 923.327884 | 1005.479772 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It's it's a | 1005.859772 | 1006.659792 |
| SPEAKER_0 | it's | 1006.659792 | 1007.159792 |
| SPEAKER_1 | a 1,000,000,000 fucking it's a 1,000,000 fucking tiny things. Yeah. You know what I | 1007.699772 | 1018.1797720000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | mean? Like, I've never feel that anxiety or that kind of, like, just | 1018.1797720000001 | 990.921647 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Right. | 1025.699772 | 1026.199772 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Anything like that. Like, I you're right. | 992.301587 | 1029.409772 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Get right. Every time I see a cop and I say, fuck the police, You know what I mean? Like, that's that's like a fucking legitimate. Like, I | 1029.489722 | 1044.1297319999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Like, you're just people who are, like, let's go kill let let's go catch some black people worse. Property of some Thank you. Bridge white people. Who, who profit and exploit off of me and also don't hire me or give me a job because they have free labor kind of thing.

| SPEAKER_2 | of like, | 1051.682884 | 1019.379759 |

| SPEAKER_1 | the | 1036.839759 | 1037.339759 |
| SPEAKER_0 | fact that they can't get out of the situation out of the the fucking violence or gang. What In that whole all of that that goes along with | 1040.429759 | 1090.6978840000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | being in | 1058.279759 | 1093.4678840000001 |

| SPEAKER_2 | no. | 1161.337884 | 1161.837884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Perfect and perfect and analogy that is literally the exact same thing. You're saying that it's you like, I can say, are they you don't know. You can't know what it feels like. To be like, constantly reminded how it's only your appearance that makes you have any value to so many people. Like, you can't pass | 1161.9778840000001 | 1202.9678840000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Correct. | 1171.329759 | 1171.829759 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Or what I talked to was, like, | 1206.357864 | 1207.9778840000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Correct. But then I mean, I can empathize with the mule. You know, fucking that's fucking | 1174.819759 | 1223.897884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | trash. | 1224.357864 | 1224.857864 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And fucking shit like that. Exists, but, like, from from me to say that I truly know That feeling would be alive. | 1191.579759 | 1243.2178840000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I'm not but I'm not saying you like, you I but first of all, I would never say that because I think that's a stupid thing to say.

So I would never say you can't pause understand because then that's just giving you an excuse to not try and understand You know? Like, I don't want you to not understand. I want you to actually, like, think about and figure out as me questions. I don't know. Try to put your yourself in a situation | 1209.079759 | 1291.307884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | where | 1291.767884 | 1292.2278840000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | literally your mind doesn't matter at all to people. When you talk. It's just that, like, oh, you're | 1259.359759 | 1304.9778840000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | pretty, | 1304.9778840000001 | 1305.297904 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and | 1305.297904 | 1305.6978840000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | so | 1305.6978840000002 | 1306.017904 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that's all that matters. Kind of thing. Or, like, that literally I don't know. | 1306.017904 | 1320.757884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 1288.759759 | 1288.919739 |
| SPEAKER_1 | mean, I'm I'm not I don't want you to feel like Well, I can't possibly know what's, like, to be. You told me a young, pretty white female one time. I was like, I what? | 1323.227864 | 1346.167864 |
| SPEAKER_3 | What do you | 1312.399759 | 1347.187884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | mean? Are you trying to say that you can't possibly, like, understand like, any of the things, like, | 1347.187884 | 1357.287884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that | 1323.219759 | 1323.719759 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I feel | 1358.167884 | 1359.527884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | or | 1359.527884 | 1359.687884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | my struggles or whatever. No. No. I'm | 1359.687884 | 1362.817884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | not that I can't, like, hear your struggle on this. Right. Get to know, like, your feelings and the struggle that that you have I'm not saying that I | 1362.817884 | 1383.817884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | fucking | 1351.079759 | 1351.579759 |
| SPEAKER_2 | any of that on the sit up. I'm set up. My it's it's second But now | 1356.279779 | 1399.117884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that | 1399.117884 | 1399.4878840000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | step That, like, another step or wave from from that and this, like, further into you to where I can I can't fully 100% know? What is, like, to be a female like, and have so much riding on my parents and fucking | 1366.299739 | 1441.577884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It literally doesn't take care feel like anything specific because if if it were a thing where patriarchy would or is was like a was the opposite and somehow or another it was a domination of no because of major arc is actually not the same thing even though it seems like it. It's not It's not. I | 1442.117884 | 1442.0997590000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | promise. | 1476.467854 | 1476.967854 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But just being the opposite. Then it would just literally be that all of the the d value would be from the men's body, and that's it. They are, like, they are value for their their mind. Basically, maybe we just use them for their strength, and that was it. If they were weak, then whatever. If they were I don't know. Like, if that was literally the only important Like, you had like, any value other than that you for entertainment. You are used for, like, just, like, props. You were just constantly, like, made to, like, show yourself and I don't | 1447.719759 | 1553.817884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | know. | 1553.957884 | 1554.457884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Then then you | 1521.519759 | 1557.827884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | could | 1557.827884 | 1558.327884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | say, well, you can't possibly know what it's like. Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't feel like anything in particular. It doesn't feel like anything. It's the feeling of having this Like, being objectified that is the feeling, and you are very much able to understand a bit. Would feel like. So to say, like, you can't understand what it's like to be a woman, or if you or a female or anything like that. No. Just woman. Like, | 1524.6597590000001 | 1564.5797590000002 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I mean, | 1567.499759 | 1602.547884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | what do you mean? You know what these things would like, what these things are and how, like, if you were in my shoes, it I not good. You know? I mean, Yeah. Like, you're right. I don't have your ID. Your eye. | 1568.719729 | 1646.377884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Imagine what it's like to | 1613.319759 | 1652.187884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | be | 1618.1197590000002 | 1618.4397589999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you. That's fine. I guess | 1652.7478839999999 | 1654.527884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I don't | 1654.587884 | 1654.9878840000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | need | 1654.9878840000001 | 1655.4678840000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | to | 1655.4678840000001 | 1655.7478839999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | what the point | 1622.399759 | 1657.797884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that's like that says, like, I would I would have to imagine what it's like to be you whereas That's | 1625.6397590000001 | 1670.107884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | fine, though. I | 1636.749759 | 1671.777854 |
| SPEAKER_3 | guess | 1671.777854 | 1672.017844 |
| SPEAKER_2 | You would have to imagine what it's like | 1672.257884 | 1676.827884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | to be mean? | 1643.6397590000001 | 1678.687884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. | 1678.9878840000001 | 1679.307884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | You're | 1679.307884 | 1679.547884 |
| SPEAKER_0 | right. But | 1679.547884 | 1680.297884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I | 1646.949759 | 1647.1897589999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | need to do that in order for | 1681.4978839999999 | 1683.6578840000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | ending | 1683.6578840000002 | 1684.127884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, | 1652.9397589999999 | 1653.4397589999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | let me just say it. Like, it's that's that's it right there. Like, it's | 1654.529759 | 1660.559759 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I guess I don't get what I guess I don't get it. And I not since I mean, I I understand what you're saying. I'm trying to tell you that I do get what you're saying. But I don't get the significance of saying that. At all because that's like saying, well, my friend had her most of her parents got cancer, didn't cancer and died. I can say all day, I don't know what that feels like. I can't possibly know what that feels like. But, what does that mean? Do I just, like, act like something's, like, that she's sad about nothing or whatever, or like, no. I imagine that that's fucking horrible. And I would absolutely do something about it. That's for my headphone to me. I'm sorry? My Headband Jack. But, like, that's it's also the same as saying, like, you can't possibly know what it's like to be somebody else and feel what they're like, if they had some sort of health problem | 1695.4078840000002 | 1787.767884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that they deal | 1753.929759 | 1788.717854 |
| SPEAKER_1 | with every day, like, of course, like, you can't you | 1788.717854 | 1793.067884 |

| SPEAKER_2 | my does that make any | 2353.777984 | 2355.437884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I understand what you're saying, but what I | 2323.0496590000002 | 2361.727884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | said didn't But | 2361.727884 | 2332.399759 |
| SPEAKER_1 | what I said didn't get answered by that whatsoever, really. I mean, I get that you're saying you can't know exactly | 2366.707884 | 2380.697884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | how much like, | 2381.637884 | 2350.619759 |
| SPEAKER_1 | how city | 2384.927884 | 2385.987784 |
| SPEAKER_3 | house | 2386.927884 | 2387.007884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | city | 2387.007884 | 2387.507884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | feels. Like, there's a measurement But that didn't address the fact that I've already I've already, like, like, accounted for that. | 2353.319759 | 2400.8577840000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Just because | 2370.219859 | 2405.3478840000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I I put this the whole like, example around and making it said that males were male | 2373.059659 | 2417.667884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | People were the ones being dominated or in the, like, on this lower rungs of the hierarchy or whatever, | 2386.319859 | 2433.787884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and explains or and, like, gave the scenario where You would be in the exact situation. As a woman As women are today, or and throughout history, and | 2401.459759 | 2426.929659 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like, | 2429.339759 | 2429.839759 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Basically, I wouldn't have to deal with that kind of, like, those kinds of worries. But | 2434.959859 | 2475.707884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | you would. | 2444.809659 | 2480.017884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | You would have to worry about those those things. Knowing that you weren't valued for anything else. And so I asked you, like, I don't understand, like, how that's sick. | 2447.159759 | 2498.5778840000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | There's | 2466.579759 | 2467.079759 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, measurement. I'm sure there are there there because some | 2467.869759 | 2473.709859 |
| SPEAKER_3 | women who feel it more than others who, like, are affected by it more than others. Others, is there like a there's no, like, measurement. There's no amount that should be, like, | 2474.699859 | 2525.037884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This should be | 2492.999759 | 2528.697884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Like, manageable or whatever. Like, I'm I'm just think that, like, if you conceal the kind of, like, | 2497.399759 | 2546.427884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The the | 2515.489759 | 2551.7028840000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I don't know what the word is, but | 2519.0197590000002 | 2555.987884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | did | 2524.049759 | 2524.549759 |
| SPEAKER_3 | devaluation and the objectification kind of if you can feel any level of that at all, if you're capable of understanding that, that's fucked up or whatever. That's shitty. That, like, how would you feel to be reduced to nothing but a body and you know, Then that's all that's needed. I mean, just saying that you're not able to, like, do injustice is kinda like, well, what do you mean? Like, I don't like, I don't even know what that means really. Because I don't want anybody to feel like this acts off the ID. The idea is to know that | 2525.5496590000002 | 2614.867784 |
| SPEAKER_2 | do it just to suggest an expression. Like like, I | 2615.507884 | 2620.987884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I'm not not no. Hey. | 2587.629759 | 2623.337784 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Do | 2623.337784 | 2623.617784 |
| SPEAKER_2 | not tell somebody | 2623.617784 | 2624.837784 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that please | 2625.137884 | 2625.8678840000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Stop. | 2591.974759 | 2592.389759 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. I don't wanna do semantics. Okay? I was not trying to to be I was not trying to do semantics on you saying it do it justice. Okay? But the point I was saying was that you were saying still that you would not be able to understand it to some sort of, like, degree that I am able to. So, therefore, it's, like, not the same thing. Like, I'm telling you that I don't understand how that's possible. I'm telling you as of as a woman, that you can absolutely understand and feel the same kind of, like, just the same kind of degradation or whatever it is per Let's Other people or just society in general, and your place in it, Ask me. Is it you have to be me to feel it or to understand it or to see it or to just, like, know that, okay, that's shitty. Like, I mean, people can handle it in different ways. There could be other things that mean nothing to do with me being female, | 2593.029759 | 2712.499759 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that | 2714.279759 | 2714.599759 |
| SPEAKER_3 | make this that feeling | 2748.907884 | 2752.167884 |
| SPEAKER_2 | worse or | 2752.947884 | 2753.8478840000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | not as bad or whatever. So I Like, that's feeling as the certain, like, | 2721.449759 | 2766.567884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the level of | 2734.059659 | 2769.887884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | what, like, I don't know. I I just feel like that's in important thing and just saying you saying that you can't possibly understand or feel like doing it justice or whatever, I think that that's false. I think that you can feel just as deeply about it as you, like, as you choose | 2769.887884 | 2805.307884 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to as you | 2771.659759 | 2806.447884 |
| SPEAKER_3 | choose to seek to understand as you choose to put yourself in in somebody else's shoes. That's all up to you. So I'm the thing of, like, no. You literally can't be me and like, face the things | 2806.447884 | 2828.407984 |
| SPEAKER_0 | To taper just like rest. Like, Karen fucking doesn't do any fucked me after put the fuck of Yes. It's Oh, like, my hands are dirty. | 2464.093005 | 2500.673005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Scars and privates in my fucking hand from what missing perform, like, the drug is, like, fucking spitting me out of the fucking drugs. Yeah. Now | 2472.24488 | 2512.65488 |

| SPEAKER_0 | But those are the only kinds of things I thoroughly Okay. But these things, are things that I maybe wanted to tell away. Some of them I did have, like, questions about, though, for sure. Like, these things, you had a bunch of these out | 2541.51488 | 2597.103005 |

| SPEAKER_1 | kidding? | 1173.087345 | 1173.587345 |
| SPEAKER_0 | About where I used to be, and there's still you can talk to certain people, and there's still that little glimmer of hope for for a while. The prison walls are sustaining I ain't gonna pull it out. | 1223.7677489999999 | 1246.0177489999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Do you hear | 1248.2577489999999 | 1249.337749 |
| SPEAKER_0 | saying that fucking everybody wants | 1250.857749 | 1252.591081 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the The prison act, but just because it'll be jobs for them. No. that's, like, I don't know. Like, that's yeah, this fucking sucks. Like, that there's not something better The light. | 1252.591081 | 1262.887749 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Wait. What do you mean? | 1262.887749 | 1263.947752 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Like, the the the the town is, like, so small with nothing to fucking do. Or whatever that there's no jobs So, like, they want the prison back so they're fucking they can have jobs. Like, that yeah. It sucks that, like, that's that that that's a thing. But, like, I mean, at least, like, they they, like, mowing the fucking work, I guess. I don't know. I don't know. | 1229.999624 | 1292.697749 |
| SPEAKER_2 | You see the prisoners as humans? | 1258.629624 | 1294.397745 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Do | 1261.329624 | 1261.409624 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you think that they do? What do you think? Think that you see it as a job? That's the part I was saying was that They want the prison back Meaning, if there were no meaning, they want people incarcerated so that they can have jobs. Their fellow human beings who are no doubt in the same, like, cost as they are. So that they could just have jobs. Just the jobs. Not because they believe in what they're doing and not the fact that what they're doing with that or that what fits how demoralizing that job is, nothing, It's not like about wanting to work out, them wanting to work Yeah. But why like, advocating for that kind of work? I'm not saying it's their fault. I don't think that they think about it at all like that, but that's kind of the idea. I don't want you to, like, think about | 1295.717749 | 1351.597749 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it. | 1351.597749 | 1351.837749 |
| SPEAKER_2 | This individual, like, yourself, just worry about yourself kind of thing. | 1317.6896239999999 | 1355.687749 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, I was I was thinking more for, like, like, convenience, like, the whole fucking week. Town if they were dependent on the prison for the fucking because it's not it's not just the prison itself because, like, you have people from all over fucking the state in that prison And so you have you have people coming to visit him on the weekends and shit. So there are fucking hotels, you know, gas stations. Restaurants, you know, shit like that. Those all get a spike in business as well. Yeah. | 1322.019624 | 1353.679614 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But who profits from this? | 1387.987739 | 1390.087749 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, I'm not I'm not saying it's fucking good. Or, like, I'm for prison because obviously, I'm anti prison, maybe? Wait. I can just see, like, how like, fucking, like, condo where your fucking tourist unit is. They they have, like, a fucking nothing out there. Damn. Jack shit out there. But on the weekends, when fucking everybody's coming from all over the state to visit their folks, in prison or whatever, fucking There's business. You know what I mean? | 1356.2696139999998 | 1425.5477489999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But is that a good | 1391.2396239999998 | 1426.357749 |
| SPEAKER_1 | thing? I mean, for a small small town economy. | 1426.357749 | 1432.427759 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Shouldn't it just be that businesses want to build business there for people to work at so that the community can drive. | 1398.6496339999999 | 1438.987749 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But if there's no clientele, there's no business. | 1438.987749 | 1441.967749 |
| SPEAKER_2 | There are clientele. What do you | 1408.399624 | 1444.427759 |
| SPEAKER_1 | mean? | 1444.427759 | 1444.5477489999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The clientele are the people who live there. | 1410.479634 | 1446.687749 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Wait. If there's no if there's no jobs, there's no money. So like, the people that live there don't have money to spend, and the businesses that are open for | 1414.379624 | 1458.2677489999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Well, you're right. But that's right. People in that community shouldn't have to have a lot of capital in order to open a business and take care of the community. But unfortunately, that's the way it is. You have people, like, with lots of money owning all of the property in that small town and not letting like, not allowing anybody with big corporations to find a lot of profit. Profit, like, instead of to go there I mean, I don't know. The people who benefit from it are not the people who live there necessarily. Yeah. They get jobs, but they don't ever rise up. They don't have any upward mobility whatsoever. I'm working at a hotel or working at McDonald's or working at the There's no upper mobility for them. I'm just living life as, like, | 1424.569624 | 1509.977749 |
| SPEAKER_2 | me to see an airplane flying overhead. When an airplane rocks their wings, they're waving at | 1571.627772 | 1612.715897 |
| SPEAKER_0 | you. | 1612.715897 | 1613.215897 |
| SPEAKER_2 | There's no airports. You know? We had no land for airports. | 1585.297775 | 1623.065899 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Really? | 1590.457772 | 1590.957772 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Level land is at a premium here in always say, good morning, make level in here. | 1594.197772 | 1638.845897 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Hello? Is it | 1611.3277659999999 | 1647.475897 |
| SPEAKER_2 | a | 1647.475897 | 1647.715893 |
| SPEAKER_1 | coal | 1647.715893 | 1647.955891 |
| SPEAKER_2 | company, sir? | 1647.955891 | 1648.675892 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I think so. | 1648.675892 | 1649.545897 |
| SPEAKER_1 | When you mine the | 1618.277772 | 1653.545897 |
| SPEAKER_2 | coal, and then you haul the coal out of here. And, and that layout is enormous piece of level land it was done. | 1653.545897 | 1667.475903 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The | 1668.015907 | 1668.2559019999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | air we're standing on now once was, Probably higher than | 1668.2559019999999 | 1673.495897 |
| SPEAKER_0 | That's crazy. | 1642.487777 | 1677.615902 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Everything on top of this particular mountain is built on a reclaimed surface mat. The airport industrial park, the federal prison, was built on a reclaimed surface line. With the co industry gone, I don't see eastern Kentucky getting better unless something else comes in | 1645.367772 | 1702.505897 |
| SPEAKER_0 | here. See, | 1702.505897 | 1702.985897 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that's the issue, I think. Like, that these companies have profiting profiting off people. They have jobs while they're there, and then they just and leave them and then that's why they get into these things where they're, like, nobody's got jobs and shit like that because the corporation who were profiting off of their labor there just decided, oh, Bye. No more cold. Bye. No more yeah. So it's like I'm the next | 1702.985897 | 1724.785897 |
| SPEAKER_1 | time. | 1724.785897 | 1724.865897 |
| SPEAKER_3 | And so now you | 1724.865897 | 1725.785897 |
| SPEAKER_2 | get | 1725.785897 | 1726.035897 |
| SPEAKER_3 | this advocating for other people to come and profit off of, like, exploiting them and then also exploiting, like, ruining the lives of | 1692.207762 | 1735.6658969999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | others. 400 people. My son-in-law is one of them. It's for station It's recession proof. You you close the factory down and you ship the jobs overseas. You can't do that to the federal president. | 1735.6658969999999 | 1750.505897 |
| SPEAKER_3 | What? Well, you could just shut it down. Mhmm. What I mean? Bad | 1716.757772 | 1757.475897 |
| SPEAKER_2 | chance. | 1757.475897 | 1757.975897 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. Like, no. You were right. We wouldn't we wouldn't worry about the jobs for prison being I mean, granted, we do have a lot of Nigerians who have jobs, | 1724.237772 | 1769.005897 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, for | 1769.005897 | 1769.455897 |
| SPEAKER_3 | so that's kind of a questionable. | 1735.387772 | 1771.075887 |
| SPEAKER_4 | That's fucking yeah. | 1771.455897 | 1772.675897 |
| SPEAKER_3 | We don't ship the jobs overseas. We bring the the over here for the jobs. | 1738.817762 | 1777.615897 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Alright. And that motherfuckers, they're late. They fucking hate black people. Like like and there's African American Africans hate African Americans. No. Not | 1744.847772 | 1792.845897 |
| SPEAKER_5 | all of them. | 1792.845897 | 1793.405887 |
| SPEAKER_4 | That's okay. I mean, not all of them. Just talking about, like | 1793.405887 | 1795.785907 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Places | 1795.8659069999999 | 1796.305897 |
| SPEAKER_4 | like California. Prison. | 1796.305897 | 1797.825897 |

| SPEAKER_4 | done. The ones that work in the prisons, them motherfuckers hate us blacks. | 1799.025897 | 1803.6458969999999 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Of course, they're subjected to them to the American, propaganda that says that this is why we treat them so bad. It, it justifies it in their | 1769.497772 | 1811.035907 |
| SPEAKER_0 | minds. | 1811.035907 | 1811.535907 |

They're not doing anything with what they're fucking like, what we're blessed with | 1777.777772 | 1844.505897 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Supposedly. Supposedly. What we appeared because everybody buys into the American dream from outside of the United States also. So of course we tell people this. I mean, the fact that most people here believe anybody make it if they try kind of thing and everybody, you know, that I mean, just people on the outside definitely see it like that too. If they are from countries that have been heavily, like, like, exported and colonized or whatever by the United States. Of course, our ID and making sure that, like, propaganda reaches their mind soon. Otherwise, | 1844.665917 | 1845.347772 |

| SPEAKER_4 | I was just saying from, like, from my experience, like, in prison, fucking the Nigerians that are working with prisons they fucking hate black people here. For the reasons that I said, like, they fucking like, I've heard the fucking arguments. Like, I've heard them fucking say the shit the mouths. | 1905.8977719999998 | 1925.187772 |

| SPEAKER_0 | evoke, invoke, | 0 | 35.528125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | universal catapult. Let me give you one more example. The case of Herbert Hoover. This is to show that it's not just a matter of cycle history being used against radicals and rebels. It could also be used against conservatives. Herbert Hoover a case study of Herbert Hoover appears in James David Barber's book on the presidential character. Barbara's treatment the active negative president, by the way, is one who experiences severe deprivation in childhood and who subsequently try to bring his environment a sense of self worth to achievement and a search for power over others Well, according to Barbara Hoover, suffered from fatal flaw of character that caused him to discard an earlier flexibility for a latter day self defeating rigidity. The early hoover was a pragmatic miracle work a humanitarian, a man who brought aid and food to the starving people of Europe in the midst of World War 1 and right afterwards. But Barbara has this problem. How could this Herbert Hoover, the pragmatic miracle worker who did all these good things, why would he freeze an opposition to relief for jobless Americans? That is the same Herbert Hoover when he became president of the United States refused to give aid to workers in the midst of the depression. They tells us that Hoover was an emotionally blocked man with an unhappy childhood that left him very emotionally blocked. Taciturn, cumulus, reserve and seldom capable of crying. In fact, Hoopa had a marriage which was very emotionally attached to in which he was very emotionally attached to his wife the little evidence that Barbara offers seems to contradict this picture of of this taciturn humanist fellow who could express on on one occasion, we when we we threaten to fight a heckler in the 1938 campaign, Bob noted that that doesn't seem like an emotionally blocked fellow. Hoover could cry. Bar day Barbara cites 2 instances when he was moved to tears in public. I don't know how many times that an emotionally address emotively blocked president is expected to cry in public. Must be found out years ago, Hoover was profoundly moved both emotion emotionally into action when visited in the White House by 3 children who were pleading to have their unemployed father released from jail. And by the way, the only contemporary testimony barber office of a of one of Hoover's contemporaries is Eugene Lyons. And he said and this is what Lyons says about Hoover's Hoover was not cold, but, quote, a sensitive saw hearted person who craves affection, enjoys continual company, and suffers under the swings of the Unquote. Well, what I'm saying in sum is that the data that Barbara offers on Hoover's life are not only selective and sketchy, but they lend themselves to a contrary interpretation. Barbara failed to make a convincing case that the trace he ascribes to Hoover are the dominant components of his character or are endowed with the significance that Barbara attributes to them. The consequences that one comes away with the feeling and we are left asking, how does he know that about Hoofa? Finally, and most important, give us the things said about Hoover's personality are true, they do not seem to have much explanatory power when applied to his public behavior, and they don't explain why Hoover acted with such self rigidity. And in fact, I'm going to give you an alternative interpretation. That is in place of the psychological Hoover I will give you the political hoover. How could Hoover | 2.1900049999999993 | 282.068125 |

| SPEAKER_2 | over 10,000,000 people went to the polls in a contest to decide whether to elect the incumbent, Nicolas Maduro, the challenger, Edmundo Gonzales, or one of the 8 other opposition candidates. And then we saw a very familiar scene. | 259.61 | 307.28812500000004 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Of course, the accusations of fraud, | 308.068125 | 309.748105 |

And this video, I want to really zoom in on that. I wanna dig deep into the story of foreign elections were served here in the US and how that reporting affects the way we understand the world outside our | 294.78 | 348.23812499999997 |
| SPEAKER_4 | country. | 348.23812499999997 | 348.73812499999997 |

Over 2,000,000 killed in Angola and a war that went on for 30 years, which shouldn't have to go on at all except that you need Ta was equipped and financed by the US. All through the Middle East all through the Middle East, popular movements, workers' movements, unions, student movements, farmer collectives, all of them, the destroyed, battered down, in Turkey, in Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, that obscenely filthy rich corrupt family wouldn't last 3 weeks if they didn't | 228.7511 | 493.6311 |
| SPEAKER_2 | have guns behind | 527.999225 | 528.9592250000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | them. People of Saudi Arabia are ready to get rid of them. And we could go on. 21 countries in Africa have had enormous amounts of US arms brides, all of this to put in the most retrograde, repressive, and corrupt rulers to destroy every popular movement, every democratic movement that emerged These people are perfectly capable of democracy. These people are perfectly capable of viable production. These people are perfectly capable of organizing their markets and their labor. They're perfectly capable. They aren't allowed to do it. Because because of this kind of destruction. The destruction of the economic infrastructure the impoverished of the people, the destruction of their future. Kill the future of a nation too. And anyone who dares to oppose it or question it is called a rogue state. Now there's no rogue state There's no terrorist movement. There's no axis of Evil. There's no communist state that has this kind of record. There's no communist red blood menace, you know, say what you want, Stalinist state. That has anything like this record of aggression, and destruction and murder and violation of international law. That just isn't. And I say the American people don't know it. All of this, by the way, is a matter of public record. It's not like I got some secret documents that just came into my hands that no one else has seen. It's all a matter of public record. But but, of course, there's some parts of the public record that get blasted across the media, and there are other parts of it that are thoroughly suppressed. Now it's not enough to bemoan or denounce this. We also have to explain it. We have to explain why Why is this happening? We will not convince outcome patriots | 528.9592250000001 | 648.889255 |
| SPEAKER_2 | of the | 648.889255 | 649.2092250000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | wrong nature of this kind of policy unless we discuss the real intent and interest behind such policy. As long as they believe that this is being done to protect them from some threats out there, They will go along with it. They don't care if their leaders are rough, They don't care if their leaders violate international law. They want them to violate international law. They want them to act like thugs and gangsters. They want them to be tough and brutal and total and decisive. That's called | 649.2092250000001 | 684.239225 |
| SPEAKER_2 | straw leadership, | 684.239225 | 651.4411 |
| SPEAKER_1 | strong defense. And when they are afraid, and that is what our leadership has done, is to conjure up fears that there's people out there gonna get us. And for a | 686.049225 | 695.829225 |
| SPEAKER_2 | long | 695.829225 | 696.079225 |
| SPEAKER_1 | time, it was the communist menace. The communist the communists are gonna get you. It's all because of communist. We have to do this. We have to support dictators because we gotta stop those communists. But a lot of these interventions came way before communism, and a lot more of them happening more frequently, more bloodily after communism. So it wasn't communism. That was one of the excuses. That was one of the bugaboo's that they raised up. That was one of the fears they conjured up so that people will rally around the flag and will do what the leaders want. And we've got to speak to that fear and say, you have a false fear There are things you really should be afraid of and you're not afraid of it. Like poisoning the environment, like going and killing all these people, like putting you to and stop fearing some little country. One year it's Noriega, next year it's Milosevic, the next year it's Gaddafi, the next year it's the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. The next year, Saddam Hussein. Remember Gaddafi? I remember 19 eighties. In the 19 eighties, I was going around lecturing, and suddenly I hear people saying to me, Gaddafi. Gaddafi. Everybody was Gaddafi. Gaddafi. What about Gaddafi? Gaddafi. Gaddafi. Gaddafi go and get your mama. Gaddafi. Mister | 662.0110999999999 | 746.7511 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Gaddafi. I | 781.359195 | 748.9711 |
| SPEAKER_1 | said, what Gaddafi? | 783.279225 | 784.339225 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What? 2 months | 784.399225 | 787.039185 |
| SPEAKER_1 | ago, you couldn't have found Libya on the map. Today, you can that | 787.039185 | 756.8411 |
| SPEAKER_2 | this | 791.149225 | 791.469225 |
| SPEAKER_1 | guy, head of a country of 3,000,000 people, with an army of 50,000 about the size of the LAPD, is a moral threat to the | 791.469225 | 803.449225 |
| SPEAKER_2 | safety | 803.449225 | 803.769225 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of the United States of America, to the national security, And what was Gaddafi's real sin? I'll tell you what his real sin was because that policy wasn't stupid when they targeted Gaddafi. Gaddafi, and their animosity toward him is a very legitimate one. Here's what Gaddafi did. Gaddafi took a country that had a social structure like Saudi Arabia where a few obscenely rich families ran the whole thing, got all the money from the oil, and the massive people will pour And what he did is he kicked those families out. He | 769.9411 | 837.449225 |
| SPEAKER_2 | and | 837.449225 | 837.859225 |
| SPEAKER_1 | his colonel's rebellion and he started a forestation program he planted millions of trees. He started health programs. Education school programs for the first time in the history the ordinary Libyans could go to school. What he was doing, and he nationalized the oil industry. And he took the Oh, he took Earnings He took the earnings from the oil industry. He still sold it to to the western markets are they gonna do with it? They they they can't drink it? They can't eat it? Should they have? More than half to sell it. To the west. But they were getting the cut on it. And that money is what he used and he gave that back to the people. And that's not what they like. Because the difference between the half and the have not I mean, the truth is the conflict between the haves and the | 804.0311 | 886.739225 |
| SPEAKER_2 | have | 886.739225 | 886.979185 |
| SPEAKER_1 | nots the haves are really the have at alls. They want it all, and they don't want to give a little bit here and a little there. US government since World War 2 has given away some $300,000,000,000 in military aid. Just think with 300,000,000,000 that could solve all the budgetary crises of all the states in the union right now. Just that amount, aid, to train, equip, and subsidize some 2,500,000 troops and internal security forces in more than 80 | 886.979185 | 921.779225 |
| SPEAKER_2 | countries not to | 921.839225 | 922.559265 |
| SPEAKER_1 | defend these nations from outside invasion, but to protect ruling oligarchs and multi national corporate investors from the dangers of domestic anti capitalist insurgency. How do we know that's true? Well, by observing For instance, that with very few exceptions, there's no evidence that these various regimes have ever been threatened by attack from neighboring countries. So why are they building up these military forces? Why are they building up these security and police and paramilitary forces? It's not to make war or defend themselves from another country that's gonna make war on them. It's to make war on their own people, to make war on their own working people. That's why. To protect those countries to make the world safe for the fortune 500. | 922.559265 | 971.289225 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Military and security forces and death squads in the various countries have been used repeatedly to destroy popular reformist movement and insurgencies that advocate some kind of egalitarian redistribution of the resources of the society. So the struggle really is between those who think that the land the labor, the natural resources, the markets, the technology, and the capital of the world in every country are there for the capital accumulation | 993.416945 | 1027.636945 |
| SPEAKER_1 | all those things are there for the needs and the social betterment of the many. That's the basic struggle that goes on. The designated enemy the demonized enemy, pumped up by the media obligingly following the line, the White House or the Pentagon puts out, the designated enemy can be a reformist, populous military government as in Panama under Tortillo, and even under Noriega. Or as in Egypt under NASA, Peru under Velasco, Portugal after Salazar, when the army officers took over, it could be a Christian social government as in Nicaragua under the Sandinistas. It could be a social democracy popular front government as in Chile under allende or Jamaica under Michael Manley or Greece under Papandreo the Dominican Republic under Wambush, It could be a Marxist Leninist government as in Cuba, Vietnam, and North Korea. An Islamic revolutionary order as in Libya under Gaddafi, or even a conservative militarist regime as in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. In 1907, this is what Woodrow Wilson said. 19 0 7. This was I don't even think he was yet governor of New Jersey. Well, he certainly wasn't president. Maybe he was governor. He was a political science professor. And president of Princeton for a while, and then and then, governor of New Jersey and then president of the United States. In 1907, Woodrow Wilson noted the role that's played by the capitalist state on behalf of private Capital. I quote him. Since trade ignores national boundaries, and the manufacturer insists on having the world as a market, | 993.418817 | 1132.576945 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. Well, whatever you want. I was gonna I'll order right now if you want me to pay for it. I don't care. | 1098.97882 | 1138.006945 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The flag of his nation must follow him, and the doors of the nation's which are closed against him must be battered down. Concessions obtained by financier's must be safeguarded by ministers of state. Now you hear that? As a bourgeois college professor, president of the United States, If I just read that statement and I said if I said the financier is are serviced by the ministers of state, The ministers of state have to safeguard the financiers. You know what people say? Oh, you're Marxists. You're Marx. That's Marxist. You know? I hear I hear that. I always hear that all the time when I was when I was just getting myself radical used to hear that. I'd say things like, I'd say, you know, I think racism is actually | 1106.82882 | 1189.376945 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Not the right of the worker who has an entitlement in the labor that he invest. I said, oh, that's Marx. That's Marx. Get this all the time. I say, you know, I don't think US policy is so innocent We're out there helping the finding. Oh, that's Marx, they say all the time. And I say, boy, this guy, Mark's, was really something. You know, here I am am. I'm knocking myself out trying to make an analysis every time I come up with something, they give him the credit. | 1221.0132 | 1244.7732 |
| SPEAKER_1 | something. That wasn't Mark. That wasn't perenti. That was reality. That's what it was. And reality happens to be Marxist. So let's repeat that sentence and go on. Woodrow Wilson is talking. Concessions obtained by financers must be safeguarded by ministers of state even if the sovereignty of unwilling nations be outraged in the process. Colonies must be obtained or planted in order that no useful corner of the world may be overlooked or left unused. Now that does sound like, March, the manifesto, the same wording he says, capitalism goes into every corner of the world to recreate it in its own image and put it to use for its capital accumulation process. Interesting. Sometimes the flag will go in before the dollars get there. And that's to create new opportunities. For instance, in 1919 in Haiti, the people started a popular rebellion and revolution They actually built a popular militia to try to get the land back from the land owners to try to get the big companies out of there and all that, The US declared political instability. They have certain code words, you know, they use, political instability. Undemocratic forces. We got a defendant. Political and instability and, of course, racism gets used very handily here. You say At least, though, brown people in this little island have to learn self governance. So we will have to go down and show them and and at least bring law and order and stability back. So they went down just just to just take care of that. And they stayed a mere 19 years and they killed 18,000 Haitians. And they also kicked out the French German, and British companies, and US companies came in. You see, capitalism not only fights the class war against its own laboring class, capital formations will often fight against each other and against other national capital formations. And, of course, the people pick up the tab on that too. You go Yugoslavia is a great case in point. I have a book there called to Kill a Nation. Got any more copies of it? Good. See, here comes the infomercial now with There it is. Okay. Yugoslavia was tolerated quite some time as a breakaway country from the eastern block of nation, so called block of nations. But after 1990, the US saw no reason to tolerate its existence anymore. I mean, here was a country, a rather large country right in Central Europe which was not which was not going the way of free market reforms as was happening in in Russia, the Ukraine, Poland, and all over. They were not doing that usual thing. They were not at first, they weren't. Yugoslavia had an economy that was 80 percent. State owned still. Yugoslavia had a high standard of living and a high degree of economic equality, Anybody could go to school to the highest level they want. And medical care was free. Yugoslavia showed no interest in joining European Union no interest at all in joining NATO, It had a productive industrial base a successful auto industry, 80% of the Yugoslav auto market was sold by the YUGO. It had construction firms that competed quite successfully throughout even in Western have Now when you destroy all that, you of course increase the value of your own capital. If I destroy your firms, destroy the auto industry, I increase the value of my auto industry. I destroy your agricultural base, I increase the value and open market opportunities for my agricultural base. And that's exactly what happened. German and US agencies supported every retrograde secessionist, and reactionary ethnic nationalists in Bosnia and Croatia, and in Kosovo, And today, been broken up into a cluster of little right wing republics where everything is privatized everything's been deregulated, sold off to private investors at garage sale prices. That's the public capital of the people's labor is now given away to private investors, where the media have been taken over by a rich private investors or conservatives. Pension funds have been plundered and disappeared Public services have been shredded. I was just in Belgrade, last March, And, I was with a friend, and she said, well, I'm gonna meet you later. It was a Saturday. I'm gonna meet you later but I'm I'm going to a doctor's appointment. Said, what do you mean? It's 7 o'clock Saturday night you're gonna see a doctor? Who would see the doctor at 7 o'clock? He says, oh, here in in Yugoslavia, the doctors will see you anytime you want because they're so desperate for patients. The public health services have broken down So people literally without, unless you can pay, are literally without services And 7 was a convenient time for her. And then the doctor said, okay. Sure. There's inflation in Yugoslavia now. There's unemployment, poverty, suicide, prostitution. All of this has skyrocketed. And, we hear next to nothing about it in the press. It's a free market paradise It has been brought into the fold of the west. That's Yugoslavia today. And, unfortunately, there were too many people on the left who supported that war and swallowed swallowed the official line. They swallowed the mass media line right down their throat. They thought they were fighting rape. Thought they were fighting a demon called Milosevic, and they didn't. And they were just ill informed and taken in. It's much too bad. And I'm including some very notable notable progressive speakers who swallowed that line. Including one who calls himself a pacifist. Okay. Now some critics say Well, economic factors are not the motive behind intervention. Because the intervention often costs more than the investment that the US has there. For instance, in the Philippines, in the Philippines, the US has spent something like $7,000,000,000 in aid. In the Philippines over the last 30, 40 years to protect the US investment that's only about 3,000,000,000 So it can't be economical. It's uneconomical. Spending £7,000,000,000 to protect £3,000,000,000 You know, Boston Bevelin answered this question over a 100 years ago. He said, what you're forgetting about the Philippines, but I'll bring him in now as a voice. What you're forgetting is that the people who paid the 7,000,000,000 and the people who have the 3,000,000,000 are them. And they'll spend $7 of your money to protect $3 of the They'll spend $20, 50, a $100 of your money just to protect $1 of their money. In fact, when it comes to protecting their money, your money is no object. Furthermore, it's not just to protect direct investments. It's to protect that whole global system. Is to destroy and suppress any country that tries an alternative self defining self developing system that tries to get out from under that that enormous system. So it's not just direct investment. The 2 most dramatic examples of US and on military direct military intervention, there was very little US money involved. In Soviet Russia in 1919, 1920 1, most of the capital was British and French. | 1220.9050750000001 | 1748.1232 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I am very privileged to introduce our main speaker. Doctor Michael Ferrani. He is a PhD from Yale | 1719.215075 | 1761.2732 |
| SPEAKER_1 | This is Michael Ferranti. Welcome to Real History. A series of talks by me on different subjects, of historic Most people I've discovered have never been exposed to real history. School, we usually don't read | 1727.875075 | 1778.1832 |
| SPEAKER_3 | history. We read | 1778.1832 | 1779.1432 |
| SPEAKER_1 | history textbook. And mainstream ones at that, which | 1779.1432 | 1782.8732 |
| SPEAKER_3 | avoid the underlying reality. | 1783.1732000000002 | 1784.8532 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, for those of us who might have a strong dedication to truth and democracy, | 1754.805075 | 1793.8332 |
| SPEAKER_3 | let's look at some real history. What I'm really gonna talk about today is the distortion of the way industry has been distorted by a particular mode of investigation. What we what might be called and what has been called. To psychological motivations. Have to do with early life. Howard Lasswell of local scientists is a pioneer in this | 1794.7732 | 1824.6932000000002 |

| SPEAKER_1 | And we hear we hear people say, including some of our progressive friends, our liberal friends, The bombings are a stupid day from family and moral. Expelling expelling people. Oh, many of those people are fleeing. 50,000 served have fled from Kosovo. In the last 3 months. Are the Serbs ethnically cleansing themselves? Coordination of cheap labor, completely defensive to the interest of capital investors. This is a batter's policy. The batter is not irrational. And that's what this is. It's a battering policy to destroy and again and never come back again. Even even as a viable bourgeois nation, on socialist The old arguments we hear was regard to Vietnam were coming back up. Well, we can't just I just hate Educate yourself and others. Watching you all the time? Why do you think like me are under surveillance? And I'm not kidding you. When I think of when the phone rings, I pick it up, and someone starts talking to me and mimicking I with someone else, then then you're moving from surveillance to harassment but they let me know that I'm under surveillance. It's not just thinking about you. You say thinking, oh, no. They always always focus on you because they know they're standing on your shoulders. And if this great mask began to shrug and rumble all that sort of thing, it gets very wobbly up there. So against the lies, Against the lies and the homicidal violence, This national security aberration and democracy can become a mighty chorus and a strong resistance. I have seen it happen before, and we make it happen again. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. | 228.40026 | 455.308395 |

| SPEAKER_1 | multibillionaires, and the rest of us will be 260 In Serbia and Bosnia, the last remaining radio station was a Serbian station. It was a distant station. It was critical in NATO. Critical of Western policy. It was the last station in all of Bos and Herzegovina. And the article in The New York Times to see the reporter committing these mental gymnastics to explain why the NATO peacekeepers, I e, Gestapo troops, went in and closed the station down. Why that was a step toward more pluralistic democracy? That this was a marvelous thing to watch him do these gyrations, you know, down this column. Yugoslavia, before the NATO bombings, before this war began, before that, and you go to Africa every opposition newspaper, every opposition political party had its own newspaper, its own radio station. That's right. 20 of them. You know, this today. And any other leader in Europe. | 22.93 | 98.50999999999999 |

That was that's what we To justify this matter to mention have held for more than 3 centuries. Most of the same is true of Sergality in Bosnia. And and so it disturbed the trying to hold on to their own. The US has punished one side in this war and unfairly, Boyd says.

I said, which which sources are you trusting? You're trusting Bill Clinton's sources? Oh, Bill Clinton wouldn't lie to us, would he? They us. It turns out they are using cluster bomb It turns out they are using depleted uranium. Our own government now says it. You trust their stories? Do you remember the 500 premature babe that the Iraqis supposedly ripped from incubators in Kuwait? The throwing a | 588.66558197 | 658.6629909999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of the poor victims whose little premature baby was in there, It turned out the story was a total fabrication. 5 100 premature babies and incubators It turns out in all of LA County, there's not more than 50 incubators. Half of them are not being used at any one time. Did Kuwait specialize in premature births? Instead of saying we shouldn't say, wait a minute. Wait a minute. What is this story about? What's going on here? It was repainted again and again. I don't know any war where rapes are not committed is not to dismiss such awful things as rapes. 2 rapes is 2 rapes too many? But the San Francisco Chronicle had a headline that said rape just just just to Lisa, rape is an official serve policy. Kosovo refugees say. Only know about official policy. And you read down 2 columns, and finally you get the OSCE official says there have been there have been owned. The rates have only numbered in the dozens, very few dozens as a matter of fact. Very few dozens of rapes. That's not an official policy. Oh, if Bill Clinton is looking to stop very few dozens of race, well, that's that's a slow, about 2 months in Washington. DC. He could start much closer to home. He could concentrate on Capitol Hill as a matter of fact or even closer. It's so touching to see our leaders finally, finally concerned about rape It is so, so touching, but it's so odd that they've gotta look so far away go fight this crime. Go forth and write a Bosnian Serb commander was calling saying an official policy, and the Bosnian Serb Armed Forces, which numbers only about 30,000 men numbered than was accused of having rape from 25 to 1 1,000 Muslim women There's an army that's involved in in in in bitter desperate military we | 623.7048659999999 | 752.794856 |

| SPEAKER_1 | wait a minute. What's going on here? What are these stories about? The serve can Serbian commander. They never were able to trace that. They traced it back to Rooter Finn. Right? That's boasts to about how it has convinced much of the progressive in America that there's genocide and ethnic cleansing and mass rape and all of this is going on. And when they were questioned about the unverifiable, unconfirmed reports, they said, our goal is public relations. We're not here to get confirmation, and we achieved our goal There was the answer blown away. The Serbs were attacked the Serbs. And that's when the Serbs went in and attacked, and that's when you had the worst the worst single | 753.6048659999999 | 843.7629909999999 |

It turns out that that massacre in Sarajevo market As the story was leaked out in French television that the bomb. David Owen? Who worked as an international negotiator with Cyrus Vance, Cyrus Vance, in his book, Oracle Odecey, page 26 2, himself admits that the NATO powers knew all along it was a Muslim bomb, and the Serb did not commit that act. When the KLA took over the casualties of a year fighting, which had been 800, both sides, counting both sides, including this to could over. It jumped suddenly to 2,000. When we called the San Francisco Chronicle Bureau Chief, we said, how did it jump from 800 to 2,000 one day? He said, 2,000 cattle people who are fighting. That's not that's a And now, of course, we have a massive reaction. By the way, the fighting on the ground with KLA and the serfs have been gone.

Albanians were coming across the border in substantial numbers, circle being driven off their lands and off their farms. There were repeated requests by Serbians to Tito himself Croatian The ship came by 1998, 1999. Population the Albanian population in Kosovo was about 75%. Although the media keeps reporting 90%. The other 25% was made what we call gypsies, and the others being Turks. Macedonians went to Abrams and a variety of other people. We also see how the leader of the country has deemed demonized when he is targeted by US policy, Gaddafi of Libya. Whose actual whose actual sin was to on things like reforestation, and health and education in clinics rather than giving it all to the people in column a. | 816.454866 | 1084.832991 |

| SPEAKER_00 | People would call him that. and he's not black. like, so, like, that's a thing. so just, i would assume that, and that it was a normal thing. | 93.9663200378418 | 103.8263200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | For some reason with kids, no. i'm not saying it's, like, i'm not saying that it's okay necessarily, but she just wasn't describing people bullying him with it. | 103.9663200378418 | 113.5263200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Like a word that people are bullied with unless you're being a racist and i don't think that makes sense to call a little kid that white. | 113.9663200378418 | 120.0263200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Okay, okay, okay. | 123.9663200378418 | 124.7263200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Yeah, i don't think they should. i don't like why they should. | 133.9663200378418 | 136.7863200378418 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Oh, oh, It's okay. My teammate was killed. I wasn't even near them, like, Uh-oh. | 138.97001004219055 | 201.57000004219054 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Nobody should be called the n -word, really. but i'm just saying that, like, it doesn't have the same meaning as it did. like, i know the same. like, this is six years old we're talking about. | 143.9663200378418 | 153.8263200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | I go on to fortnite to play with him one day and it's just... so he also uses the app? i mean, now he is because he's being called and he doesn't even know what... | 153.9663200378418 | 163.38632003784178 |
| SPEAKER_00 | So, like, she's fucking... she's | 164.9663200378418 | 166.9863200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Inconsistent and... like, what? sorry, what? | 166.9863200187683 | 169.1863200187683 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Sorry. she's taking her understanding of the word and applying it to him specifically. | 169.18632006645203 | 173.36632006645203 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Saying that people are calling him it whenever he's using it as well, so fucking, they're not, they're not fucking bullying him with it, they're fucking just, so fucking, they're | 173.9663200378418 | 183.8063200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Yeah, exactly. that's what i'm saying. that's why i feel like she's trolling. i feel like she has to be. | 183.9663200378418 | 189.1863200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | She's | 193.9663200378418 | 194.2863200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Very articulate in a way. she's switching your | 194.2863199710846 | 196.7263199710846 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Shoes. yeah, | 196.72632002830505 | 197.58632002830507 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Exactly. and she's saying something, like the way she describes it, you would think that it's, i don't know, yeah, it's just crazy. | 197.58631992340088 | 203.86631992340088 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Like | 203.9663200378418 | 203.9663200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Aww. | 213.9663200378418 | 213.9663200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Wait, | 226.9663200378418 | 227.0063200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | What did you tell him when you were playing fortnite with him and he said it? what did you tell him? | 227.00631999969482 | 230.22631999969482 |
| SPEAKER_01 | But wait. okay. | 233.9663200378418 | 235.66632003784179 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Right. | 235.6663200855255 | 236.8063200855255 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Oh my god. Oh. I got a big fight, and it's a it's a good movie. This is good. It's like kinda smooth. Okay. I mean, I'm on my second life. I'll probably die here in a second. But I'm picturing my name. Okey dokey. Don't fall asleep in the shower. Well, you did that before. When you said you did, said that you fell asleep, like, sitting on the floor? In the shower? Oh, okay. Well, don't fall asleep. Don't do that. | 238.86999988555908 | 446.9781248855591 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Apply to you so it shouldn't affect you. what does that mean? | 243.9663200378418 | 246.8263200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Well, it doesn't apply to him. like, it's... | 246.82631993293762 | 251.10631993293762 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Or, i feel like i know what this is, but i don't. i know what this is, but i don't. | 256.9663200378418 | 260.3863200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Oh, okay. | 263.9663200378418 | 264.2263200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | I'll change it back to five second rewind. and fast forward. | 273.9663200378418 | 278.2063200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | I'm sorry. that is a thing. okay. i'm sorry. i must be... | 283.9663200378418 | 292.8863200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Okay, like, i get called, you know, cracker. i get called, um... | 293.9663200378418 | 297.7863200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | I never hear that, like, i don't know, that's weird. | 307.9663200378418 | 312.6063200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | I don't know. | 312.606320142746 | 313.42632014274596 |
| SPEAKER_01 | I mean, i'm saying like i never just... how is that wrong | 313.9663200378418 | 316.0663200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Though? this is like for a specific group of people. it's not right. like, necessarily. like, it's not right. but it's just... | 316.06631994247437 | 322.50631994247436 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Like, that shit is, i think, offensive as fuck, calling them, like, that stupid because they'll, like, just incest babies and stuff like that. like, that's fucked up, for real. anybody that's, like... | 323.9663200378418 | 333.74632003784177 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Backwards is like... | 333.9663200378418 | 335.7663200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Does he call them hillbillies or something? but no, i feel like they have to be some guy | 335.7663199901581 | 343.8663199901581 |
| SPEAKER_00 | They also have to be like, there has to be something about them that's socially unacceptable too. and i still don't think it's okay, but i just feel like it's like, not just because they're hillbillies, | 343.9663200378418 | 353.8663200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Unless, i don't know, that seems like a really cool way to just refer to white people who are, like, not from the city or whatever. or, like, not | 353.9663200378418 | 363.7663200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | From the city or whatever. but, yeah, just the, it's, | 363.9663200378418 | 373.3263200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Still not the same thing though either way i don't know and just for you to be like | 373.9663200378418 | 379.6463200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | No | 379.646320104599 | 380.646320104599 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Because well first of all that's not even the same | 380.646320104599 | 383.726320104599 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Form of word, but, like... | 383.9663200378418 | 383.9663200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Do you think the n -word means black person? i mean, that's what it says in the dictionary. it's in the dictionary. | 393.9663200378418 | 403.6863200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | It's maybe not in their dictionary, but it was in the dictionary, and i'm pretty sure it still is. | 403.9663200378418 | 411.4463200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | It | 411.4463200569153 | 412.3863200569153 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Just means an ignorant... | 412.38632011413574 | 413.54632011413577 |
| SPEAKER_01 | That's | 414.9663200378418 | 415.2663200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | All it means. | 415.2663199901581 | 415.78631999015806 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Okay, i mean, everybody who's probably in the comments will probably think that i'm a... wait, wait, wait. this is | 415.7863199710846 | 422.5863199710846 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Fucking digger. | 422.5863199234009 | 423.66631992340086 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Yeah, exactly. | 423.9663200378418 | 423.9663200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Oh my god. oh my god. | 433.9663200378418 | 434.0063200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Other terms about inbred and redneck and all those terms. oh my fucking | 443.9663200378418 | 447.4663200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | God. | 447.4663200378418 | 448.8463200378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Because it's making it's a racial slur for white people. i mean, i think that every race has its slurs. | 448.8463201522827 | 453.70632015228273 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Even the gay community has its own slurs now so it's like kids are saying it gay | 453.9663200378418 | 459.2263200378418 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Slurs are not anywhere near new | 459.22632002830505 | 463.30632002830504 |
| SPEAKER_00 | Exactly, and also they have their own gay, like their own and their, like what do you mean? these are, slurs are things that the like, | 463.9663200378418 | 472.8863200378418 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Why would Well, like, some some circuits have more than 2 wires. Like like, your blinkers have 3 wires running to a ground and then one for the flashes and one for the brake, one for the parking lights. | 618.8762021064758 | 673.5343241064759 |
| SPEAKER_1 | they take the stuff? | 625.9043231010437 | 626.7843231010437 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Ban? | 626.784322977066 | 627.284322977066 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But that's because there is also colors and lots | 628.9343230724335 | 632.0643240724335 |
| SPEAKER_0 | This box only came with 2 colors. Right. He's just a signifier for, like, | 633.904324054718 | 640.554324054718 |

| SPEAKER_1 | high above | 641.194324016571 | 641.5143230165711 |
| SPEAKER_0 | the negative. That's usually, like, the the difference in water colors in one of the box of that. | 641.5143229961395 | 648.2443239961394 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Okay. They're gonna | 645.576199054718 | 681.184324054718 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Mhmm. How | 648.2443239688873 | 615.7861989688873 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But some circuits have different different colored wires Like, some circuits are one white wire, one black wire in that situation. Yeah. The white is black is the black is native. Yeah. And then sometimes they have a black and brown | 648.6261990070343 | 700.7943240070343 |
| SPEAKER_0 | the fuck wouldn't shouldn't it just be red and black? | 650.0943241119385 | 652.1443241119385 |
| SPEAKER_0 | So if you got that box, it's only blue and orange. This one is somebody | 667.2062039375305 | 704.6943239375305 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Whichever one you want because this doesn't determine the the what's on the wire. | 670.9461939334869 | 711.0443199334869 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It's negative is black. Okay. Typically, | 675.7743270397186 | 645.0161990397186 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I know. I get that part. You're just saying it's, like, to differentiate for yourself. Yeah. | 679.0662040710449 | 682.8761990710449 |

| SPEAKER_0 | is? Yeah. It's to measure the space between your base | 1451.9800128936768 | 1458.7700118936768 |
| SPEAKER_0 | It's a service. | 1453.4718880653381 | 1488.840013065338 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Is that a | 1459.41188788414 | 1494.1200128841401 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That is what is that one? How does that go to? That is a part of it's a servo motor. What's | 1465.0500130653381 | 1474.1900130653382 |
| SPEAKER_0 | that? | 1474.1900129318237 | 1474.6900129318237 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It's, basically an electric motor. | 1475.2300128936768 | 1478.8500128936766 |
| SPEAKER_1 | 41 | 1481.8918778896332 | 1482.3918778896332 |
| SPEAKER_0 | A battery? What? Put it on? You actually want them? | 1484.6718881130219 | 1522.3400031130218 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's a it it's just a motor. It just turns | 1489.1400129795074 | 1491.7200109795074 |
| SPEAKER_1 | What's | 1492.2818880081177 | 1492.4418920081177 |
| SPEAKER_2 | car? I think this is from my fucking throttle body. Does that have an electronic throttle body? And that's a door sensor. God isn't here. Mhmm. | 1494.120012998581 | 1513.5900129985807 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Walkie | 1495.6118879318237 | 1495.6918879318237 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Those only carry 1.5 volts. So I don't | 1500.4418880939484 | 1536.9633430939484 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The fuses protect circuits from amperage overloading. Oh, | 1521.201898097992 | 1558.950013097992 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I wanna see. | 1522.3400030136108 | 1523.480013013611 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Alright. Never mind. I'm stupid. | 1526.621887922287 | 1562.470012922287 |
| SPEAKER_0 | called the battery. | 1526.7500169277191 | 1527.570016927719 |
| SPEAKER_0 | rider. Oh, those kind of batteries. So doing him do, like, a double a battery. | 1530.0000131130219 | 1533.700013113022 |
| SPEAKER_0 | know. I didn't know many folks do whatever it | 1536.9633429050446 | 1540.4100129050446 |
| SPEAKER_2 | is. Everything on modern vehicles is 12 volts. Oh, wow. Except for, like, hybrids because they have | 1540.410012960434 | 1547.870012960434 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Not kilo. That's | 1542.871887922287 | 1544.831877922287 |

| SPEAKER_1 | okay. | 1558.950012922287 | 1559.450012922287 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Because current is measured in amps and then, Voltage is a measure of | 1563.6500129699707 | 1572.4900129699706 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Anything related to that other than amps and voltage. I'll put it. What are these things? | 1567.751888036728 | 1617.6100130367279 |

| SPEAKER_2 | watch. Yeah. I'm trying to think what the first voltage is a measure of touching The average is the level of current. | 1580.24001288414 | 1591.1000128841401 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Voltage is a measure of the electric potential difference | 1583.5418980121613 | 1621.7100230121612 |
| SPEAKER_2 | two points in a circuit indicating the amount of energy available to move electric charge. It's often described as the quote unquote pressure that pushes electrons through a conducting loop enabling them to do work. Those are end caps for my camshafts. And then camshaft, seals. | 1588.3618879318237 | 1612.7218879318236 |
| SPEAKER_0 | It is also the field. | 1620.8518979549408 | 1656.6200129549409 |

| SPEAKER_1 | they | 1676.24001288414 | 1676.40001288414 |
| SPEAKER_2 | are. Ambrege is a measure of the flow of the electric current in a circuit. It indicates the amount of electric charge in a point in the circuit for unit of time. There's a broken valve stem. I don't belong | 1676.4000129699707 | 1722.5200129699706 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, none of this This is a 3 year old's | 1689.7018880844116 | 1725.7700130844116 |

| SPEAKER_1 | I began to see this what springs up spontaneously and gives it a new form, a structure, an effective channel, and can eventually transform ideology into myth. We shall return later to the connection. Between ideology and propaganda. Chapter 3, the necessity for propaganda. A common view of propaganda is that it is the work of a few evil men. Seducers of the people, cheats and authoritarian rulers who want to dominate a population, then it is the handmaiden of more or less illegitimate powers. This view always thinks of propaganda as being made voluntarily It assumes that a man decides to make propaganda then the government establishes a propaganda ministry. And if things just develop from thereon. According to this view, the power is just an object. A passive crowd that one can manipulate, influence, and use. And this notion is held not only by those who think one can manipulate the crowds, but also by those who think propaganda is not very effective and can be resisted easily. In other words, this view distinguishes between an active factor, the propaganda and the passive factor, the crowd. The mass, man, Good dog. According to this conception, propaganda is a sinister invention of the military cast. Or is actually it is the expression of modern society as a whole. Seen from that angle, it is easy to pushed into evil ways by the propagandist. The propagandist is entirely without blame because he has been fooled into fallen into a trap. The militant Nazi and communist are just poor victims who must not be fought. But must be psychologically liberated from that trap. We adapted to freedom. And shown the truth. In any event, the propaganda is seen in the role of the poor devil who can help himself. Who has no means of defense against the bird of prey who swoops down on him from the skies. A similar point of view can be found in studies on how advertising, which regard the buyer as victim and prey. In all this, the propaganda is never charged with the slightest responsibility for a phenomenon regarded as originating entirely outside of themselves. We know that the psychological factor which includes encirclement integration into a group, and participation in action in addition to personal conviction, is decisive. To draw up plans for an organization, a system of work, political methods, and institutions is not enough. The individual must participate in all this from the bottom of his heart. With pleasure and deep satisfaction, If the common market is wanted, a unit must be set up to psychologically prepare the people for the common market. This is absolutely necessary because the institutions mean nothing by themselves. NATO also needs propaganda for its members. Esperi's proposal of 1956 to create a new form that would correspond to the common form. Is extremely significant. Person political warfare is very inadequate. The economic point of view, one may well say that the recession was much more psychological than a technical or economic development.

Services of popularization are permitted to furnish not only technical consultants, but primarily psychological agitators on the pattern of the famous county agents in the United States or the council in Scandinavia. Efforts at popularizing and at instilling conviction take place simultaneously. The USSR is still much more advanced in the direction of a full fledged agricultural public land with technically perfect and production, radio broadcasts, and films in daily publication of published results as in our press. Joining me this campaign of the local best explains the whole effort is He must accept and search for innovations like his work. Support his organization. | 250.51999999999998 | 360.03812500000004 |

| SPEAKER_1 | The best example is the new German Army. The German soldier must be convinced of the validity of what he deserves. This psychological approach is designed to show or assumes an individual has been indoctrinated. | 340.21999999999997 | 403.41812500000003 |

| SPEAKER_2 | by | 519.978125 | 520.1581249999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | every citizen of the technological age, propaganda could not spread. To ensnare the innocent citizen. Rather, there is a citizen who craves propaganda from the bottom craving. Papagandists would not exist without potential propagandese to begin with. To understand that propaganda is not just a deliberate and more or less arbitrary creation by some people in power is therefore essential. | 486.09 | 550.928175 |
| SPEAKER_0 | It is | 518.5899999999999 | 553.138125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | a strictly sociological | 553.138125 | 554.2781249999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Simple reason that the masses have come to participate in political affairs. Let's not call this democracy. This is only one aspect of it. To begin with, there is the concrete reality of masses. In a sparsely populated country, politics can be made by small groups separated from each other and from the masses, which will not form a public opinion, and are remote from the centers of power. The nearness of the masses to the seats of power is very important. Pericles and Tiberius were well aware of it, as were Louis the 14th. And Napoleon. They installed themselves in the countryside, far from the crowds in order to govern peace outside the | 581.3877190000001 | 619.8377210000001 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Because he considered the newspaper the principal instrument of propaganda, Primary education makes it possible enter the realm of propaganda. In China, Mao simplified the script in his battle with illiteracy in some places in China, new alphabets have been Alright. | 169.95 | 284 |

| SPEAKER_2 | We also must consider the fact that in a society who puts propaganda whether direct or indirect, conscious or unconscious, unconscious or unconscious, What are you | 374.85 | 425.958125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | doing? | 426.178125 | 426.678125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Here, we can also see the idealist illusion of those who hope | 414.06999999999994 | 451.588125 |

| SPEAKER_3 | She was rubbing her face on the fucking microphone towel. | 475.328125 | 478.54815499999995 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Such as, for example, propaganda on the injustice of capitalism, on economic crisis, or on colonialism. Intellectuals | 467.77 | 477.23 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But yeah. There's I don't know about the orange one, but | 497.78 | 537.098125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Only the public's smaller propaganda. Naturally, the educated man does not believe in propaganda. This | 537.258125 | 524.66 |
| SPEAKER_0 | is | 559.588125 | 559.978125 |
| SPEAKER_4 | What? Anybody else. Is | 530.12 | 564.998125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that This is also true. This is not only true for doctor Neur propaganda, which is based on exact facts, and acts on the level of the most highly developed people who have a sense of values and know a good deal about political realities. Such as, for example, the propaganda on the injustice of capitalism, on economic crises, or on colonialism, it is only normal that the most educated people intellectuals are the first to be reached by such propaganda. But this is also true for the crudest kind of propaganda. For example, the campaign on peace and | 564.998125 | 606.688125 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the campaign | 606.688125 | 607.168095 |

| SPEAKER_3 | I didn't hear | 601.26 | 637.408085 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that. Okay. | 637.408085 | 637.728125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Well, not in my okay. That's fine. | 637.728125 | 639.898125 |
| SPEAKER_2 | This is, in fact, one of his great weaknesses. An propagandist are well aware that in order to reach someone, one must first convince | 606.23 | 647.708125 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Too much depth of doctrine is creating divergent currents and permitting the intellectual to escape social control. | 634.878784 | 641.3087842000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So since I'm so convinced of my superiority and propaganda actually super effective on me. | 642.188784 | 647.618784 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's not necessarily the part I was talking about, but basically believing that propaganda is ineffectual on you But these problems is what more susceptible. Condition reflexes | 648.6587840000001 | 658.9387830000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Oh, | 659.0187830000001 | 659.5187830000001 |

| SPEAKER_0 | others on you. | 667.1787840000001 | 669.5287840000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Real, not at all. That | 643.360659 | 679.588784 |
| SPEAKER_0 | was not a real fit. I was a boy. | 679.588784 | 681.2887840000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | To do a more profound propaganda job after the middle, one must Conversely, an individual of the middle class of good general culture will be less susceptible to agitation propaganda than ideal prey of integration propaganda. This has also been observed by Lipsett who holds that ignorance in politics and economics leads to conflicts in these spheres less clear. And therefore less intense to the observer. And for this reason, the ignorant or less susceptible to propaganda on such questions. Information. Of course, basic education permits the dissemination not only of propaganda, but of information in general. The same way with the new condition, Kopaka Contrary to the simplistic differentiation between propaganda and information, We have demonstrated a close relationship between the 2. In reality, to distinguish exactly between propaganda and information, impossible. Besides, information is an essential element of propaganda. For propaganda to succeed, it must have reference to political or economic reality. Doctor Noah's historical argument is only incidentally affected in propaganda. It has power only in connection with the interpretation of events. Has an effect only when an opinion is already aroused, troubled, or oriented in a certain direction by a political or economic event. It grasps itself onto an already existing psychological reality. Such psychological reactions are generally of brief duration and must be systematically sustained and renewed. To the extent that they will be prolonged and renewed, but we have no informed opinion with regard political or economic affairs. Obligand cannot exist. For this reason, in most of the older countries, propaganda was localized and restricted to those groups which had direct contact with political life. It was not designed for the masses and different to such questions. Indifference because they were uninformed. Masses cannot be interested in political and economic until mass most difficult to reach are the peasants for a variety of reasons already quite But another essential reason is that they are uninformed. Studies of rural and news have shown that propaganda begins to bite among peasants. The exact moment when information is promulgated there. When facts become known, the attention to certain questions is aroused. Obviously, if I do not know that war is being waged in Korea, and that North Korea and China are enemies, One of the United States occupies South Korea and that it represents the UN in Korea. Any gun? Communist propaganda on alleged American biological warfare means nothing to me. Papaganda means precisely nothing without preliminary information. Therefore, propaganda to politically ignorant groups can be made. Only if preceded by extensive, profound, and serious information work. Good note, This is why in the Soviet Union, one does not risks of information and propaganda. Dispenser of information. Radio and press are above all. Media of propaganda. Mister Pardanov, director of the TARS Agency said in 1956, information should be didactic and educative. Not to mention the fact that pure information is a excellent medium of propaganda. Bald information without commentary can lead to acceptance of a whole propaganda line. The broader and more objective view information, the more effective subsequent propaganda will be. Once again, propaganda does not base itself on errors but on exact facts. It even seems that the more informed, how more. Better, the more susceptible it is to propaganda. The greater a person's knowledge of political and economic facts the more sensitive and vulnerable is his judgment. Intellectuals are most easily reached by propaganda, particularly are a number of newspapers expressing diverse attitudes just because he is better informed is more so subjective than anyone else to a propaganda that we cannot perceive. Even though he claims to retain free choice in the management of all this information. Actually, he is being conditioned to absorb all the propaganda and This information not only provides the basis for propaganda, it gives propaganda means to | 651.3406590000001 | 982.9887840000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | If you were ignorant of what went on in the nation and in the world and his only sources of information were equally uninformed neighbors. And in that case, propaganda would be impossible. Even if that man were actually to suffer personal difficulty as a result of certain political or economic situations, Abengand had no effect on the populations of the 19th century, even when a village was plundered by an army because in the face of personal experiences, people were But in any event, | 1053.1165210000001 | 1085.456521 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the situation. To look upon it as a generally valid phenomenon. And to build a specific response to such a generalization, it would demand a considerable amount of voluntary intellectual labor. As propaganda becomes possible only when people develop a consciousness of general problems, say and specific responses to them. The formation of such responses is precisely what the promulgation of information creates in individuals who have only limited personal contact with social media. Through information, rebel against his immediate superiors. And it is well known that such rebellion leads nowhere That was the early discovery of the 19th century. An information will teach this worker that he shares Finally, informational teaching for evaluation the socialist slightly maintained, was much more wanted information than what propaganda. At that very moment, while information is absorbed, the spirit of rebellion transforms itself into the spirit of evolution. As a result of information, individuals come to feel that their own personal problems and Put down. Moreover, the newer the problem is raised, the more vulnerable that will be. The role of information is to introduce individuals to knowledge and new when he cannot relate to previous patterns, when in grief, opinion is nonstructured. The task of information is to put the individuals in this situation of non | 1038.328396 | 1248.196521 |

| SPEAKER_0 | your nostril. | 712.4577119999999 | 714.157712 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But we must remember that we cannot simply juxtapose those two types of proofs. Because a whole society is also composed of multiple groups. A conflict between primary and secondary opinions will arise. When | 714.537712 | 693.269587 |
| SPEAKER_2 | we've done this pre allopying like | 727.577712 | 729.2576919999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Propaganda exists only in Alright. | 729.337712 | 697.499587 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So I think this is reflecting the color of the light that this shining on it because it looks like real | 731.807712 | 737.357712 |
| SPEAKER_2 | fucking it looks like silver, but I know it's not silver. Find some | 737.357712 | 741.127712 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Corresponds | 748.137712 | 748.537712 |
| SPEAKER_3 | to | 748.537712 | 748.617712 |
| SPEAKER_1 | what we have said about the mass of society. The mass media of communication | 748.617712 | 754.7576919999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | mean, does it does the other parts that are reflecting on the light look | 720.689587 | 757.717712 |
| SPEAKER_5 | silver? | 757.717712 | 758.157712 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Or does that part look particularly silver? Like | 725.919587 | 762.707732 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that. The edge the broken edge that's particular silver. | 762.707732 | 732.6495869999999 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. Okay. So maybe that's what it looks like whenever it's freshly baked. It's | 766.9577119999999 | 770.577732 |

| SPEAKER_0 | 570, I think. | 864.929587 | 900.237712 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Or yeah. That's what I said. | 865.929587 | 902.2576919999999 |
| SPEAKER_5 | 540, something like | 870.289587 | 906.117712 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that. | 906.117712 | 906.617712 |
| SPEAKER_0 | I think 600 would be good. | 873.3396069999999 | 909.6677119999999 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Or | 881.1695669999999 | 881.409587 |
| SPEAKER_4 | 2 it was, like, 2 something | 915.717712 | 917.417692 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Celsius. | 884.3695869999999 | 884.8695869999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 200 degrees Celsius. | 886.709607 | 922.557712 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Don't know for sure. | 889.779587 | 924.847712 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Why am I fucking here on a horse? I'm with you, bitch. I don't know what it is. I don't know. 108 degrees. | 906.669627 | 946.117712 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But the act of acquiring the set brings up a point that we will discuss in considerable length The complicity the propaganda If he is a propagandie, it is because he wants to be. For he is ready to buy a paper, go to the movies, pay for a radio, | 920.7495869999999 | 971.0477119999999 |
| SPEAKER_7 | or a TV set. | 971.0477119999999 | 971.687712 |
| SPEAKER_2 | We don't do nothing to that. | 971.687712 | 972.967712 |
| SPEAKER_1 | He does not buy these in order to be propagandized. His motivations are more complex. But in doing these things, he must know that he opens the door to propaganda. | 938.659587 | 982.297762 |
| SPEAKER_4 | That's you. And | 948.159587 | 983.027682 |
| SPEAKER_1 | he | 983.027682 | 983.527682 |
| SPEAKER_7 | subjected to it. | 983.827672 | 984.617712 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Where he is conscious of this, the attraction of owning a radio is so much greater than the fear of propaganda. That he voluntarily agrees to receive propaganda. | 950.789587 | 993.2177419999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 200 years. 4 This is even more | 993.2177419999999 | 995.347752 |
| SPEAKER_1 | true where transmission is by collective receiving set. As in communist countries. The jurors gather even though they know what they hear is necessarily propaganda. But they cannot escape the attraction of the radio. Or the hypnotism of TV. The fact is even more striking with regard to the newspapers. When a reader buys a paper he likes, the paper in which he finds his own ideas and opinions will reflect he really wants to be propagandized. He wants to submit to his influence and actually exercise | 995.347752 | 1028.857712 |
| SPEAKER_7 | his | 1029.237712 | 1029.2877119999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | his choice in the direction of the propaganda he wishes to receive. He cancels his subscription. He cannot stand anything that does not run on his rails. This is the very mentality of the propaganda. | 994.9795869999999 | 1049.857712 |
| SPEAKER_7 | As we see it. But | 1017.629587 | 1053.2177120000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | no one say | 1053.2177120000001 | 1054.357712 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I was | 1020.909587 | 1055.877712 |
| SPEAKER_7 | kidding. Kind of. But I said that here | 1055.937712 | 1057.2177120000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | we're describing you. Right. And then but now but now what he's saying is, it said it's not new anymore. Talking about peep like, how people choose to be propagandized | 1057.377712 | 1076.167712 |
| SPEAKER_7 | By | 1043.949587 | 1044.349587 |
| SPEAKER_4 | buying buying or paying to watch watch movies, like, watch the movies, different, like, whatever, or the you said radio too, like, but we don't really listen to radio like that anymore. | 1044.989587 | 1090.397672 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Is it naughty? | 1058.509587 | 1093.5577119999998 |

| SPEAKER_4 | What? That's crazy. It just now, like, balled up. Weird. Maybe you're doing to get a lower That was weird. | 1134.4977119999999 | 1141.957672 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Now do we go back to the other one? | 1114.8895870000001 | 1150.867712 |
| SPEAKER_3 | If this shit cools | 1124.809647 | 1160.1677519999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | and fucking forms up into, like, the fucking alien twos again, I'm gonna fucking shit myself. Scared, Mid Ohio. | 1160.1677519999998 | 1178.857762 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I don't know. I don't know if it's even up to the thing. Alright. Not all that. Not just | 1172.739587 | 1221.107712 |
| SPEAKER_7 | Yep. | 1234.279587 | 1234.779587 |

| SPEAKER_7 | Yes. | 1315.089547 | 1315.589547 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Is it just because of the air and it's really light, or | 1316.739587 | 1353.367712 |
| SPEAKER_7 | is it because | 1353.367712 | 1353.7677119999998 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Debate question. Is internalized racism among African Americans a product of historical oppression and systemic discrimination or is it a result of individual choice and psychological factors? Opening statements, Marxist leftist debate. Internalized racism among African Americans cannot be separated from the historical and material conditions that have shaped their experiences in a society rooted in white supremacy and capitalism. For centuries, African Americans have been subjected to slavery, segregation, and systemic all of which have created conditions where racist ideologies have been embedded in the social fabric. The idea that African Americans internalize racism is not simply a psychological issue, but a survival mechanism within a society that continually devalues blackness. These internalized beliefs are the result of a centuries old conditioning process. Deeply intertwined with the economic structures that rely on racial higher hierarchies to maintain inequality. Sex and motherfuckers. Internalize these racist attitudes. It is not a matter of personal failure, but the outcome of a society built on structural racism that continuously reinforce these messages. Therefore, we must examine the roots of this internalization within the broader context of racial capitalism, and imperialism. Typical opponent, Internalized racism is certainly a complex issue, but I believe it can also be seen as a personal matter. People have agency over their beliefs and behaviors. And it's not entirely fair to blame society or historical oppression for every instance of self hate or internalized bias. African Americans, like any group, can choose to overcome negative stereotypes and prejudices even if they've been exposed to them. Of course, systemic racism exists, but we can't ignore the power of individual resilience and the ability to reject harmful ideologies. Overcoming internalized racism, in this view, is about personal growth in empowerment, and breaking free from the negative narratives that's society has imposed. It's about understanding and reasserting one's identity despite the forces trying to devalue it. Back and forth exchanges Marxist leftist debater. It is crucial to understand that internalized racist | 259.231714 | 448.919839 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Pervasive and structural. For example, black people are often portrayed as criminals or as poor, uneducated, and laid This feeds into a sense of inferiority that many individuals in internalize over time, often without even realizing it. So I would ask how can we divorce this internalization from the systemic forces that constantly push black people to view themselves through the lens of white supremacy. How can we claim that this is simply a site psychological issue? To be | 478.67692 | 518.02692 |

Capitalism may not be perfect, but let's not pretend it's some grand scheme of oppression. It's simply a system that allows individuals to rise based on effort, Talent. And personal initiative The world is richer and more technologically advanced than ever before. People in capitalist countries enjoy choices comforts, and opportunities unimaginable under any other system. If workers felt so exploited and if this so called false consciousness were really preventing them from seeing the truth, what do we see massive sustained revolts everywhere. Instead, people often defend the market's freedoms and inspire to move up the economic ladder. Hardly the behavior of Duke victims. Let's be reasonable. Capitalism, while flawed, encourages innovation, rewards hard work, and expands overall prosperity. To argue that it's inherently exploitative or that everyone's been bamboozled by some invisible ideological apparatus seems more like a conspiracy theory. Than a coherent critique. Back and forth exchanges, Marxist left is debating. Your response presumes that if capitalism were truly exploitative, workers would instantly revolt. But consider how deeply capitalist ideology from childhood. People learn that private property is sacrosanct. That success equates to wealth and that competition is the natural state of human relations. These are not neutral facts. Ideological constructs. The absence of open rebellion, | 554.128795 | 737.19692 |
| SPEAKER_2 | is not proof of | 703.1287749999999 | 738.15692 |
| SPEAKER_1 | consent. But of resignation confusion. People may choose to work under exploitative conditions. But this occurs in a context shaped by necessity. Limited alternatives, ideological conditioning Wages remain stagnant while profits soar. The majority receives only a fraction of the value they produce. While a few accumulate fortunes that translate into political and cultural power. Is it not telling that those with financial might invest heavily in media outlets, political campaigns, and think tanks to ensure workers' internalized narratives justifying the status quo is inevitable. Typical opponent This idea that people are conditioned just sidesteps human agency. Markets give people what they want. If someone doesn't like their job, they can find another one. If they believe wages are too low, can start their own business. The fact that millions dream of making it in a capitalist framework starting a company, innovating | 738.15692 | 792.1169199999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | something | 792.57692 | 792.7169200000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | climbing the corporate ladder. Contradiction narrative. People don't seem to feel coerced. They voluntarily participate because they see tangible benefits. Also, economic opportunities the chance for a better life, and access to consumer goods are all more abundant in capitalist societies than in command economies. Would people notice if they were systematically being shortchanged? Marxist left this debater. People can certainly move from one low wage shop to another. But is that genuine freedom or a manipulated set of restricted choices? The fact that countless individuals accept conditions that barely meet their base needs doesn't negate exploitation. It confirms its ubiquity. This is precisely how false consciousness operates. It frames limited options as personal choices masking the structural barriers that prevent collective power. Let's consider actual data. Income inequality has soared globally. With the wealthiest 1% owning more wealth than the rest combined in many countries. If innovation and opportunity were equitably available, why do we see such persistent patterns of concentration at the top? Moreover, your suggestion that one can simply start a business ignores the obstacles. Access to capital, and transcorporate power market saturation. That ensure most fail. Does it not strike you as strange that so much of our collect creativity is channeled not toward meeting human needs but towards securing profits for a minority class typical opponent, Inequality isn't automatically exploitation. Some people simply work harder invest wisely, or come up with groundbreaking ideas. The top earners might indeed own a lot. But they also | 758.6487950000001 | 888.6269199999999 |
| SPEAKER_2 | create jobs. | 888.6269199999999 | 889.2069200000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Fund research, and donate to charitable causes. | 855.5487949999999 | 892.31692 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Maybe the system isn't perfect, | 858.248775 | 894.15692 |
| SPEAKER_1 | but it's improved living standards worldwide. People own cars, smartphones, and have services at their fingertips. Under capitalism, revolutions aren't happening because by and large, people find the system acceptable. If false consciousness were so powerful wouldn't it have to be constantly pulled by brute force? Instead, we have free speech, open criticism, oppressed that can scrutinize the company. How is that consistent with a system built on mass deception? Marxist leftist | 894.15692 | 922.03692 |
| SPEAKER_2 | debate | 922.03692 | 922.39692 |
| SPEAKER_1 | power and capitalism doesn't always require brute force. It thrives on subtlety. The ideology is reproduced not merely by censorship, but by shaping what people consider common sense. Corporate media outlets frame poverty as an individual failing. Not a systemic issue. Education systems present capitalism | 889.128795 | 941.42692 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Oh, that's how I come in to see. Take it, Kipsey. Take it. 6 months. Go potty. Go outside. Go party. Come on. People aren't tricked. | 984.274619 | 1003.214619 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Clinically, we met once because there are many children that | 924.295273 | 961.503418 |
| SPEAKER_1 | all their actions were justified. It is difficult to make them reenter the ranks. To integrate them into the normal framework of politics and economics. What has been unleashed cannot be brought under control, so easily, particularly habits of violence. The newly established government must then use propaganda to eliminate these to conquer individuals | 927.555273 | 1017.423368 |
| SPEAKER_2 | into Me. | 1017.423368 | 1018.4433980000001 |

| SPEAKER_2 | As | 1132.5852730000001 | 1132.905273 |
| SPEAKER_1 | early as 1920, integration propaganda as conceived by Lennon was employed. But it dampens the revolutionary mentality only very | 1167.213398 | 1174.833398 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It wasn't that bad. But | 1140.745273 | 1176.4133980000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | 1920 knots and the effects of agitation | 1176.8134180000002 | 1179.073398 |
| SPEAKER_3 | The book was Disappeared. Ridiculously much better. Like, how much better fucking the Game of Thrones books were than the fucking show? Never watched that shit? | 1145.195273 | 1198.523398 |

| SPEAKER_4 | all | 1235.133398 | 1235.213398 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the | 1235.213398 | 1235.3733980000002 |

| SPEAKER_2 | It's on Google Chrome. | 1201.955273 | 1237.7233580000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The propaganda aimed at DSA and SS was agitation propaganda. As was the propaganda pushing the German people into war in 1939 | 1208.055273 | 1250.363398 |
| SPEAKER_4 | circle. | 1250.843358 | 1251.343358 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 39. Yeah. | 1251.653348 | 1218.5652730000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The same time, the population as a whole was subjected to a proper I think so. I think | 1218.805273 | 1260.193398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that a long time ago because I didn't like I need to change it back because it's touching really annoying. Yeah. I changed it because I didn't | 1260.193398 | 1267.743398 |
| SPEAKER_4 | don't | 1233.8352730000001 | 1234.3152730000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | know. | 1268.6233980000002 | 1269.103368 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Did you remember | 1269.103368 | 1269.763398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | me? No. I | 1270.2233580000002 | 1270.703398 |
| SPEAKER_4 | didn't | 1270.703398 | 1270.943398 |
| SPEAKER_0 | want you to, like, | 1270.943398 | 1271.923398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I | 1238.3152730000002 | 1238.395273 |
| SPEAKER_0 | didn't know what you're gonna | 1272.703398 | 1273.703398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | do. I | 1273.703398 | 1240.6052730000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | mean, I hope you wouldn't do that, but I also got | 1274.9133980000001 | 1276.9133980000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | a thought that, like education, | 1276.9133980000001 | 1278.113398 |
| SPEAKER_1 | use your voice. I know. | 1278.113398 | 1279.923398 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Not that I don't want you, like | 1245.775223 | 1280.883398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Exactly. | 1281.043368 | 1281.443398 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I just don't | 1281.443398 | 1281.843358 |
| SPEAKER_0 | want | 1281.843358 | 1282.0833480000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you to, | 1282.0833480000001 | 1282.323398 |
| SPEAKER_5 | like, | 1282.323398 | 1282.563398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | ruin anything, | 1282.563398 | 1283.443398 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I | 1283.443398 | 1283.5233480000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | guess. Oh, I didn't do that. | 1283.5233480000002 | 1284.8933980000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And finally pursued his agitation. This will lead inevitably to dictatorship. And probably some more. Other regimes, however, have managed perfectly well to pass from one propaganda to the other and to make integration propaganda take the lead rapidly. This was the case of | 1251.6352729999999 | 1304.673398 |
| SPEAKER_4 | North | 1304.673398 | 1304.8333980000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Vietnam | 1304.8333980000002 | 1304.9333980000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | China. | 1305.133398 | 1305.233398 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And we're going the remarkable | 1305.793368 | 1307.5833980000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | conception of | 1307.6433980000002 | 1308.1233980000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | propaganda, which | 1308.1233980000002 | 1308.6033980000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | they have | 1308.6033980000002 | 1309.243398 |
| SPEAKER_1 | had since the time of the revolution. Oh, | 1309.243398 | 1277.065323 |
| SPEAKER_2 | really? In fact, | 1311.373448 | 1312.733428 |
| SPEAKER_1 | since 1927, now this propaganda has been subversive. I'm glad you didn't really know. It appeals to the most | 1312.733428 | 1317.563398 |
| SPEAKER_3 | basic | 1317.703398 | 1317.863398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | feelings in the world. | 1317.863398 | 1318.663358 |
| SPEAKER_0 | My letters. Some of them are good. I'm glad that you didn't ruin the one. | 1318.743398 | 1322.373448 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Is a sexual education. | 1298.5452730000002 | 1334.553398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | A | 1300.505273 | 1300.5852730000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | first one | 1334.8933980000002 | 1335.746738 |
| SPEAKER_1 | ago. Long winded explanations telling him why it is necessary to act a particular way. A bias with seemingly objective news system is set on this part of that propaganda. Behavior is | 1335.746738 | 1346.8933980000002 |
| SPEAKER_0 | regimented. It's just it's still done, but it's all caps | 1346.8933980000002 | 1349.773398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | and x y e. Into a prodigious date. That's really annoying. Yeah. I did that, like, over a month ago, I think. After | 1349.773398 | 1361.383458 |
| SPEAKER_1 | victory. And to be inserted into the new society regardless systems or environmental explosion. This patient in particular is shaping of the whole man is putting into the mold. | 1361.383458 | 1373.613398 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Of course, Every time I situation in which | 1343.745313 | 1380.213398 |
| SPEAKER_1 | man would integrate group, and he substituted one complete framework for another. Also, he needed only to shape the minds of people who had had very little education Had? | 1380.213398 | 1391.983428 |
| SPEAKER_2 | In the western sense of | 1392.1033980000002 | 1393.223398 |
| SPEAKER_1 | the term. So that they learned to understand everything through | 1393.223398 | 1396.733428 |
| SPEAKER_2 | god. I thought I heard you. | 1362.865303 | 1398.8533980000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Some interpretations that he knew how to inculcate. | 1399.013398 | 1401.513398 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Inculcate? Under such conditions, | 1368.0652730000002 | 1404.193398 |
| SPEAKER_1 | integration | 1370.205273 | 1370.685273 |
| SPEAKER_3 | is easy | 1404.993398 | 1405.543368 |
| SPEAKER_4 | and | 1405.543368 | 1405.793368 |
| SPEAKER_1 | practically irreversible. Explains the defeat of French propaganda in Algeria. Since 1955. On one side, the propaganda of the FLN was an act of agitation designed to arouse feelings of subversion and combat. Against this, the French army painted a propaganda of integration. Of assimilation into a French framework and into the French administration. French political concepts, education, professional training, ideology. But a world of difference lay between the two as to speed, ease, and effectiveness. Which explains why in this competition between propagandists, the FLN won out at almost every stage. This does not mean that FLN propaganda reflected the real feeling of the Algerians. I'm calling | 1405.793368 | 1456.773398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | somebody | 1456.773398 | 1457.273398 |
| SPEAKER_1 | else. You're unhappy. So rise and slay your master, and tomorrow you will be free. And others say, we will help you, work with you, and in the end, all your problems will be solved. There is little question as to who will command the Legion. Of course. John. Yes. Of | 1457.4133980000001 | 1474.1633980000001 |
| SPEAKER_0 | everything. Ah. You've got to do it. | 1474.1633980000001 | 1475.123448 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Integration propaganda. As | 1475.123448 | 1443.001903 |
| SPEAKER_0 | we Good afternoon. | 1477.310028 | 1478.6433980000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Is by far the most important new | 1478.7233580000002 | 1481.043368 |
| SPEAKER_3 | fact | 1481.043368 | 1481.243398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | about | 1446.935273 | 1447.435273 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yay. | 1482.3333980000002 | 1482.463398 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Vertical and horizontal propaganda. Classic propaganda, as one usually thinks of it, is a vertical propaganda. In the sense that it is made by a deeper, a technician, a political or religious head, who acts from the superior position of his authority and seeks to influence the crowd below. Such propaganda comes from above, It is conceived in the secret recesses of political enclaves. It uses all technical methods of centralized mass communication. | 1449.755273 | 1511.133398 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Let | 1511.273398 | 1511.653398 |
| SPEAKER_2 | my teammate. Wow. I was about to run into that. | 1477.825273 | 1513.0853980000002 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Oh my god. I was recalling like a horrible session Saturday. My | 1483.3852729999999 | 1520.733428 |
| SPEAKER_1 | guy? Last well between direct affect the propaganda. | 1520.733428 | 1524.613398 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Damn. It's killing everybody. I'm | 1494.345273 | 1530.3333980000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | like, | 1530.3333980000002 | 1530.573398 |
| SPEAKER_0 | should I hate can | 1530.573398 | 1531.5333580000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I hate it? | 1531.5333580000001 | 1532.063398 |
| SPEAKER_0 | The mind can be able | 1497.9152330000002 | 1532.943398 |
| SPEAKER_4 | to | 1532.943398 | 1533.193398 |
| SPEAKER_3 | quote. | 1533.193398 | 1533.6633980000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Shit. Oh, hi. You can | 1499.755323 | 1534.623448 |
| SPEAKER_1 | even | 1534.623448 | 1534.703398 |
| SPEAKER_6 | over here. | 1534.943448 | 1535.253448 |
| SPEAKER_1 | For hatred. Got. There's a direct. She's in front of me. I put it down on a bus. Really? That was | 1535.503448 | 1542.883398 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the mouse. | 1543.343398 | 1544.003398 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Yeah. | 1544.463398 | 1544.803398 |
| SPEAKER_1 | The propaganda requires a passive attitude from those subjected to it. | 1510.495273 | 1548.9333980000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | A rebel | 1515.0252730000002 | 1549.813398 |
| SPEAKER_0 | already | 1549.813398 | 1550.293368 |
| SPEAKER_7 | is there. They | 1550.293368 | 1550.5333580000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | are | 1550.5333580000001 | 1550.773398 |
| SPEAKER_1 | manipulated They are commissioned. | 1550.773398 | 1552.463398 |
| SPEAKER_0 | He's not his own. Though he believes it is. Wait. We're talking. Throughout, it is conceived and willed outside of him. The propagandist is acting through him. Wait. Why are y'all feeding me? Remember, I guess I do the same thing. Thanks, Yalla. There's nothing Sally. Oh, fuck you. The little guy? Mhmm. This is all the morseau because he often is plunged into a mass of propagandies in which he loses his individuality. And becomes one element among others inseparable from the crowd and inconceivable without it. In any case, vertical propaganda is by far the most widespread. You | 1576.5506110000001 | 1608.910611 |
| SPEAKER_1 | guys still like oh, okay. No. You're you're thinking it. sense | 1608.910611 | 1576.882486 |
| SPEAKER_2 | what it is | 1611.190611 | 1611.910611 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to make. But its direct effects are extremely perishable, and it must be renewed constantly. | 1611.910611 | 1583.172486 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Frank. No. | 1617.700609 | 1618.100611 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It is primarily useful for education propagator. Horizontal propaganda is a much more recent development. We know it in 2 forms, Chinese propaganda and group dynamics in human relation. The first is political propaganda. The second is sociological propaganda. Both are integration propaganda. Their characteristics surprising as that may seem when we consider their totally different origins. In context, research methods and perspective, | 1618.100611 | 1648.870611 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Physics. | 1615.192486 | 1615.692486 |
| SPEAKER_0 | His presence and his identity are not even known. | 1684.979337 | 1687.7993369 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Meetings are intimate. Discussion is informal. Non leader resides. Progress is slow. There must be many meetings each recalling events of the preceding one. So that a common experience can be shared. To produce voluntary rather than | 1774.639618 | 1790.9796179999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Are they all jumbled up again? No? Okay. | 1795.599618 | 1799.4596179999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Much more effective and binding than the mechanical action of physical propaganda. When the individual is mechanized, he can be manipulated easily. But the good him | 1799.559618 | 1773.9514929999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | on expects is much more so than the money. Oh, okay. Vertical propaganda needs the huge apparatus of the mass media. | 1774.271493 | 1781.091493 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I didn't know | 1815.4596179999999 | 1816.072948 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that was | 1816.072948 | 1816.419618 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you, so I thought it was, like, a bag | 1816.419618 | 1818.2596179999998 |
| SPEAKER_3 | of Oh, I'm sorry? | 1818.2596179999998 | 1819.319616 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Organization of people. Each individual must be inserted into a group, impossible into several groups with convergent actions. The groups must be homogeneous, specialized, and small. 15 | 1785.791493 | 1832.4996179999998 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Such men must be unswerving, integrated into the group themselves, and must a stabilizing and lasting influence. They must be members of an integrated political body. In this case, the Communist Party. This form of propaganda needs 2 conditions. First of all, a lack of contact between groups. A member of small group must not belong to other groups in which he would be subjected to other influences. That would give him a chance to find himself again and with it, the strength to resist. This is why the Chinese communist insisted on breaking up traditional groups | 1877.915753 | 1910.865751 |
| SPEAKER_1 | sexes, and occupations the family is a tremendous obstacle to such propaganda. In China, where the family was still very powerful, it had to be broken up. The problem is very different in the United States and in the western societies. There, the social structures are sufficiently flexible and disentangles to be no obstacle. It is not necessary to break up the family in order to make the group dynamic and fully The family already is broken. And no longer has the power to envelop the individual. It is no longer the place where the individual is formed and has his roots. The feeling is clear for the influence of small groups. | 1876.047628 | 1948.585748 |
| SPEAKER_0 | That? Oh, babe. | 1994.7537039800002 | 1995.8137040000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Was weird. Sorry. | 1996.5737040000001 | 1997.393704 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Was it a good pillow? What was I | 1997.7737040000002 | 2011.873704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | was just I didn't know. We're not | 2011.873704 | 2013.313705 |
| SPEAKER_0 | doing that. Reality through groups that are not This | 2013.313705 | 2017.0937040000001 |
| SPEAKER_1 | and what is lived in Obviously, no political instruction is possible there. No. All Americans already know the great principles and institutions of democracy. | 1995.095579 | 2041.133704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Oh, that was awesome. Political. | 2007.615583 | 2043.953704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Their education is specifically democratic. They used | 2009.885579 | 2047.723704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to say Sorry. To take action. | 2047.723704 | 2049.783704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | How to behave as members of a | 2016.5155790000001 | 2052.9324540000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | democracy. | 2052.9324540000002 | 2053.233704 |
| SPEAKER_3 | We will | 2018.9255790000002 | 2053.7137040000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It is indeed | 2053.793706 | 2054.4537060000002 |
| SPEAKER_3 | a civil | 2054.993704 | 2055.323704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | education. A civil education. Are you live | 2055.323704 | 2057.8837040000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | in? | 2057.8837040000003 | 2057.9637040000002 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Yes. It's | 2057.9637040000002 | 2058.3637040000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it's one we're in London right | 2058.3637040000003 | 2060.1337040000003 |
| SPEAKER_4 | I think it's just lagging because the Christmas update or something. It's, like, really lagging. | 2026.065579 | 2064.073704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Propaganda aimed at obtaining adherence to a society, its principles its ideology, and its myths. Probably and the regime employing horizontal propaganda can come | 2030.4355790000002 | 2080.183704 |
| SPEAKER_0 | into | 2046.1955790000002 | 2046.4355790000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | her style. Old construction. I gotcha. Oh, okay. | 2080.743704 | 2083.483709 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Requires the breaking up of other groups, such as the family. Now we must understand that the education given in the political small groups requires either the disappearance of academic education or its integration into the system. In the organization then, William h White, clearly shows the way in which the American school is becoming more and more a simple letter to adapt youngsters to American society. As for the Chinese school, it is only a system of propaganda charged with catechizing children. While teaching them to read. Horizontal propaganda | 2053.3755730000003 | 2121.1337040000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | does seem very | 2121.1337040000003 | 2121.773704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | hard to make. Particularly because it needs so many instructors. | 2121.773704 | 2125.443714 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. | 2125.663704 | 2126.163704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | This is a | 2092.685579 | 2127.313694 |
| SPEAKER_2 | situation | 2127.313694 | 2127.813694 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that has been through its meticulous encirclement of everybody. In the effect of the | 2128.033704 | 2131.413704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | itself. It is | 2099.335579 | 2136.033704 |

| SPEAKER_1 | The person who are alive alike, and when actually can formulate the will of such a | 2146.293704 | 2150.6937040000003 |
| SPEAKER_6 | group. Sadie Iran. But all this is ultimately Is that an oxymoron? Into | 2116.625579 | 2120.645579 |
| SPEAKER_1 | totalitarian | 2154.953704 | 2155.453704 |
| SPEAKER_3 | and | 2156.233704 | 2156.473714 |
| SPEAKER_1 | exclusive propaganda. | 2156.473714 | 2156.873704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It's | 2156.873704 | 2157.373704 |
| SPEAKER_6 | like system view. Has succeeded in passing. No. | 2157.6737040000003 | 2161.283704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Oh, | 2161.283704 | 2161.3637040000003 |
| SPEAKER_4 | okay. Very good. Like, because I ran as I ran as, like, I running I'm running. I'm | 2161.3637040000003 | 2166.003704 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Jamie | 2166.003704 | 2166.4037040000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | or | 2166.4037040000003 | 2166.583704 |
| SPEAKER_6 | No. Like, Iran, like, it's like a It's like a It probably gets like, has, like, a bunch of desert in it is still a well established where there's no shade. Oh, | 2132.515579 | 2140.225589 |
| SPEAKER_4 | okay. Okay. I get | 2174.533714 | 2175.353704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it. | 2175.353704 | 2175.603704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Distinction between propaganda and information is | 2141.775579 | 2178.083704 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Oh, damn. Information is Oh my god. Who? Penguin. The green | 2178.163704 | 2183.703704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I think I'm gonna get it. Expressed to me. Fucking | 2149.705579 | 2186.413704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | booster. | 2186.413704 | 2186.913704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So simple. Or there is such a thing as rational propaganda. | 2158.185579 | 2196.163704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Just as | 2162.685579 | 2197.393704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | there is rational advertising. | 2197.393704 | 2198.773704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I've | 2165.885589 | 2165.965579 |
| SPEAKER_1 | heard this one for automobiles | 2200.273704 | 2201.493704 |
| SPEAKER_6 | or electrical companies. He says advertising. He says advertisement. | 2201.6337040000003 | 2204.783714 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Improvement. | 2205.4237040000003 | 2205.9237040000003 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Mhmm. | 2172.565579 | 2173.065579 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Well, | 2208.308704 | 2208.808704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Similarly, | 2176.155579 | 2176.655579 |
| SPEAKER_1 | there is a propaganda based | 2211.183704 | 2212.623704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | I | 2212.703704 | 2212.783704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | don't know, actually. | 2212.783704 | 2213.583704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I can't change these facts. | 2213.583704 | 2215.283714 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Economic I was gonna say | 2215.283714 | 2216.493704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | maybe | 2216.493704 | 2216.8637040000003 |
| SPEAKER_4 | the way it's spelled | 2183.035569 | 2217.803704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Yeah. | 2217.9536940000003 | 2218.103704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Ever Actually, since I joined | 2218.253704 | 2219.103704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | converted. I don't know. | 2219.263694 | 2220.393704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Based on the undeniable scientific progress | 2186.245579 | 2222.073694 |
| SPEAKER_5 | and | 2222.073694 | 2222.153694 |
| SPEAKER_1 | economic development of the Soviet Union. Murder is still propaganda, If | 2222.153694 | 2194.705579 |
| SPEAKER_5 | he | 2229.013704 | 2229.093704 |
| SPEAKER_6 | doesn't | 2229.093704 | 2229.333704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | have a million pauses | 2229.333704 | 2230.453704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | straight rational Fuck. The superiority of its system demands to demand everybody's support. | 2230.773704 | 2236.1337040000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | No. | 2203.205569 | 2203.5205690000003 |
| SPEAKER_6 | God dammit. What | 2237.8286940000003 | 2238.6337040000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | happened? | 2238.6337040000003 | 2239.1337040000003 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Are you using a Ruby? | 2205.455579 | 2241.703704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Obvious facts. When an enemy army has just suffered a defeat, an appeal to enemy soldiers to surrender will seem rational. The superiority of one of the combatants becomes a Oh, but His appeal for surrender is an appeal to reason. Similarly, the propaganda of French grandeur since 1950 8 is a rational and factual propaganda. French films in particular are almost all centered around French technological success The film, Algerian, France, is an economic film. Overloaded with economic geography and statistics. But it's to do this. Propaganda. Hey. How's | 2242.323704 | 2279.8237040000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | it going? Oh, is this | 2279.8237040000004 | 2280.9237040000003 |
| SPEAKER_0 | 3 the 3 squares aren't your friends. Right? Oh, for the Jonas. Okay. | 2246.855579 | 2284.053704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's | 2284.053704 | 2284.393704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | why. I could've sworn that was a u | 2250.085579 | 2286.5857340000002 |
| SPEAKER_6 | player. 3 square | 2286.5857340000002 | 2287.4437040000003 |
| SPEAKER_4 | The 3 squares guy with their | 2253.295579 | 2289.203704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | their name, | 2289.203704 | 2289.683704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | sir. 3 | 2289.683704 | 2289.843704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | squares? | 2289.843704 | 2290.343704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Accept them | 2256.305579 | 2291.343704 |
| SPEAKER_6 | I have no idea. I'm not confirming | 2257.435559 | 2294.333684 |
| SPEAKER_5 | yeah. | 2261.7855990000003 | 2262.2855990000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Also attempt. | 2262.6355790000002 | 2297.663704 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Ah, fuck me. I've done | 2297.663704 | 2298.543704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | the battle. | 2298.543704 | 2299.283704 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I'm | 2266.0755790000003 | 2266.155579 |
| SPEAKER_6 | fucking spinning. American services | 2300.4637040000002 | 2301.9236840000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | aren't | 2301.983674 | 2302.483674 |
| SPEAKER_5 | typical. Goddamn it. | 2303.103704 | 2304.393704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And nothing resembles these American publications more than the public, which has taken over exactly the same propaganda style. We can say that the more progress we make, more propaganda becomes rational. The more it is based on serious argument. | 2272.555579 | 2324.033704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I'm a nation | 2289.805579 | 2324.853704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | of | 2325.553704 | 2325.633704 |
| SPEAKER_6 | knowledge. God. The Irish one's a nation. | 2325.633704 | 2327.733704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | It | 2328.1137040000003 | 2328.1937040000003 |
| SPEAKER_6 | hasn't. | 2328.1937040000003 | 2328.6937040000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Have correctly noted the differences in this connection between the propaganda of 1914 and that of 1940. The latter is more sober and informative. Less emotional and more or less As we say in fashion of opponents, it is abreast less to the superego and more to the ego. | 2300.465559 | 2352.833684 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Snake. | 2320.3655790000003 | 2320.8655790000003 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Yeah. | 2322.275559 | 2322.775559 |
| SPEAKER_4 | We're on either side | 2358.2636740000003 | 2359.4037040000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of contained elements of fact. If there's most inflammatory species, always contain some fats which serve as base or pretext. | 2359.543674 | 2367.3437240000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | How it has affected go? | 2367.3437240000003 | 2334.725579 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Nowadays to find a frenzy propaganda composed so of claims without relation to reality. It is still found in Egyptian propaganda it appeared in July 1960 in Lumumba's propaganda in the Belgian Congo. Such propaganda is now discredited but it still convinces and always excites. Other men needs relation to facts, a self justification to convince himself that by acting in a certain way, he is obeying reason and proved experience. We must, therefore, study the close relationship between information and propaganda. Propaganda's content increasingly resembles information, It has even clearly been | 2369.0737040000004 | 2409.263704 |
| SPEAKER_3 | proved | 2409.263704 | 2409.583704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | better violent, excessive, shock provoking propaganda text leads ultimately to less conviction and are to patient. A more | 2409.583704 | 2417.223734 |
| SPEAKER_3 | informative | 2417.223734 | 2417.723734 |
| SPEAKER_2 | text on the | 2418.103704 | 2419.223734 |
| SPEAKER_1 | same subject. A large dose of fear precipitates immediate action. A reasonably small dose produces lasting support. The listeners' critical powers decrease if the propaganda message is more rational bless Violet. Abbogand's content therefore attempts to be rational and factual. But is this enough to show that propaganda is | 2419.223734 | 2440.583684 |
| SPEAKER_4 | It was a fucking bot? | 2440.663704 | 2441.863684 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Is that It | 2441.863684 | 2408.265579 |
| SPEAKER_4 | was | 2442.5737040000004 | 2442.893704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | rebels or | 2442.893704 | 2443.773704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | what? No. It wasn't. Wait. Was it? The bot | 2443.773704 | 2445.6137040000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | was rebel? | 2445.6137040000003 | 2446.6737040000003 |
| SPEAKER_4 | That's funny. | 2412.775579 | 2447.8237040000004 |
| SPEAKER_5 | When | 2415.435579 | 2415.595599 |
| SPEAKER_1 | an individual has read a textbook | 2449.9037240000002 | 2451.263704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That's | 2451.3437240000003 | 2451.663704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | dumb. | 2451.663704 | 2452.163704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I don't know what to do. How does that happen? | 2422.695579 | 2458.603704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | You can feed the bot to make it, like, the biggest on the board, and then they become rebel. Wheel suspension. Which is what | 2458.603704 | 2465.043704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | initially happened? | 2465.043704 | 2466.103704 |
| SPEAKER_3 | All | 2431.975579 | 2432.295579 |
| SPEAKER_1 | those technical descriptions and the exact details will form a general picture in his head rather vague, but highly covered, And when he speaks of the engine, he will say, it's terrific. | 2466.603704 | 2477.243704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | It | 2444.565579 | 2444.805559 |
| SPEAKER_1 | is exactly the same with all rational, logical, factual, propaganda. Does the leader remember the figures and statistics as he understood the as you absorb the line of reasoning if he is not an economist by profession, he will retain an overall impression | 2479.113684 | 2467.765549 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Gipsy Golladay. | 2502.1937040000003 | 2503.1736840000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | That | 2503.393684 | 2503.893684 |
| SPEAKER_1 | these Americans thought Russians, They have methods. Progress is important after all. And so on. Similarly, emerging from the show and other films such as Algeria Francees, he forgets all the figures and logical proofs | 2470.6155790000003 | 2520.733704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | and retains all | 2520.733704 | 2521.773704 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the | 2521.773704 | 2521.853704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | feeling | 2521.853704 | 2522.093704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of | 2522.093704 | 2522.253664 |
| SPEAKER_5 | right | 2522.253664 | 2522.553704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | foot pride in the accomplishments of France and Algeria. Yeah. Thereafter, what remains with the individual affected by this propaganda? Is a perfectly irrational picture. A purely emotional event, a myth. | 2488.485579 | 2535.803704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Uh-uh. A myth. That's the first thing. | 2502.855579 | 2539.4037040000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | All I forgot. | 2539.483704 | 2540.303704 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. | 2506.905579 | 2506.985519 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Of the impression. And this is indeed what the propagandist ultimately seeks. The individual will never begin to act on the basis of facts to engage in purely rational | 2541.373664 | 2552.643744 |
| SPEAKER_6 | behavior. More dogs. Pigs | 2552.643744 | 2554.063704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Invasion of the future. The myth, The problem is to create an irrational response on the basis of rational | 2522.345579 | 2563.513734 |
| SPEAKER_5 | and | 2563.513734 | 2563.8237040000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | factual elements. That response must be fed with facts. The spranes must then promote rigorous and logical proofs. Thus propaganda in itself becomes honest, straight, exact, but its effect remains irrational. Because of the spontaneous transformation of all its contents by the individual. We emphasize that this is true not just for propaganda, but also for information. Except for the specialist, information, even when it is very well presented, means people only abroad in each of the world. And much of the information disseminated nowadays, research findings facts, statistics, explanations, analysis, eliminate personal judgment and the capacity to form one's own opinion. Even | 2529.995529 | 2574.385549 |
| SPEAKER_5 | more | 2608.693674 | 2608.853704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Oh my god. You don't answer. You're still in right into the | 2609.013734 | 2610.933704 |
| SPEAKER_5 | rock. | 2610.933704 | 2611.433704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. | 2580.905579 | 2581.405579 |
| SPEAKER_1 | He drowned him. | 2585.0355790000003 | 2620.303704 |
| SPEAKER_4 | What's that | 2589.545579 | 2624.253704 |
| SPEAKER_1 | mean? | 2624.253704 | 2624.753704 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Are terrific and so on. A survey of data far from permitting people to make judgments and form opinions, prevents them from doing so and actually paralyzed. Miss you, Keith. They are caught of a well informed and must remain at the level of the facts they have been given. They cannot even form a choice or a judgment in other areas or on other subjects. Thus, the mechanisms of modern information induce a sort of hypnosis in the individual who cannot get out of the field that has been laid out for him by the information. | 2639.70169 | 2670.88169 |
| SPEAKER_1 | His opinion | 2671.261691 | 2671.741693 |
| SPEAKER_0 | will ultimately be formed solely on the basis of the | 2671.741693 | 2674.3016900000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Loaded. Individual issued by state information. That's the truth. But I | 2643.663567 | 2685.861688 |
| SPEAKER_2 | don't know if that means something | 2685.861688 | 2687.321687 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like I hope so. Know. | 2687.62169 | 2688.92169 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Oh, | 2655.3935650000003 | 2655.633565 |
| SPEAKER_2 | okay. That means | 2689.94169 | 2690.50169 |
| SPEAKER_0 | for me. Okay. That's what that means. | 2690.50169 | 2692.14169 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I've used loaded as to describe | 2657.993565 | 2694.32169 |
| SPEAKER_1 | my high | 2694.62169 | 2695.64169 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I've used loaded to describe, like, having money | 2662.053565 | 2699.32169 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Yeah. So | 2666.293565 | 2700.92169 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I was I I knew | 2700.92169 | 2701.96169 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of, | 2701.96169 | 2702.12169 |
| SPEAKER_2 | like, | 2702.12169 | 2702.62169 |
| SPEAKER_0 | knew I was familiar with the meaning something, and then when you said, I hope so, I was like, oh, yeah. It means something. | 2668.423565 | 2707.31169 |
| SPEAKER_2 | It can mean loaded as in have lots of money. | 2673.423565 | 2710.2916840000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Forget that. | 2710.371686 | 2711.27169 |
| SPEAKER_3 | This is only chapter 2? | 2677.583565 | 2713.111684 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Why It's they're long chapters. They're they're, like, split up in sub sections. | 2713.2516800000003 | 2716.52169 |

| SPEAKER_4 | a | 3103.19169 | 3103.27169 |
| SPEAKER_1 | radical individual. | 3103.27169 | 3104.02169 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Individualism Knowing. | 3071.658565 | 3074.343565 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Of course, the 2 are not diametrically opposed. Where the greatest value is attributed to the individual, on the | 3075.283565 | 3115.9716900000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | basis of | 3115.9716900000003 | 3116.4517100000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | society composed in essence only of individuals and therefore one that is not integrated. But all those here in reality are not each total opposition. A great difference nevertheless exists between them. An individualist theory the individual has eminent value Man himself is the master of his life. In individualist reality, each human being is subject to innumerable forces and influences and is not at all matched of his own life. As long as solidly comes I have mass exist. Those who are integrated into the Oh, got | 3116.4517100000003 | 3151.21169 |
| SPEAKER_2 | a | 3151.21169 | 3151.46169 |
| SPEAKER_4 | big go. | 3151.46169 | 3151.70169 |
| SPEAKER_1 | But at the same time, they are protected by them against such external influences as propaganda. Yes. He's right. An individual can be influenced by forces such propaganda only when he is cut off from membership in local group. Mhmm. | 3117.793565 | 3131.173565 |
| SPEAKER_4 | If | 3165.48169 | 3165.56169 |
| SPEAKER_1 | such | 3165.56169 | 3165.96169 |
| SPEAKER_2 | groups are organic Killer. Structured | 3165.96169 | 3167.32169 |
| SPEAKER_1 | material, spiritual, and emotional. No life. Are not easily penetrated by propaganda. For example, it is much more difficult today for an outside propaganda to influence a soldier, integrated into a military group, or a militant member of a monolithic party than to influence the same man when he is a near citizen. No is the organic group sensitive to psychological disintegration of such small groups. Is their family with the church. Once these groups lost their importance, the individual was left substantially He was plunged into a new environment generally urban and thereby uprooted. He no longer had a traditional place in which to live. And there's no longer geographically attached to a fixed place. | 3167.32169 | 3220.23169 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Historic | 3220.48169 | 3220.98169 |
| SPEAKER_1 | to his ancestry. An individual less uprooted can only be part of the | 3186.953565 | 3225.80166 |

| SPEAKER_1 | Is one of the reasons why this group is relatively unaffected by propaganda. Gervais himself recognized that | 3324.8535650000003 | 3365.48169 |
| SPEAKER_3 | the weapons could be | 3365.48169 | 3366.36169 |
| SPEAKER_1 | reached only if their structure knew you were shut. The difficulties that Leonard experienced in integrating the Russian peasantry into the pattern of the revolution are well known. Thus, here is one of the first conditions for the growth and development of modern propaganda. The emergence in most Europe in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th Precisely because that is when in society | 3366.36169 | 3389.37169 |

| SPEAKER_4 | is. | 3398.27169 | 3398.77169 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Breaking up with his own thing. | 3368.503565 | 3404.25169 |

| SPEAKER_0 | started. Do I look like I am a religious | 3394.733525 | 3431.22164 |
| SPEAKER_1 | About 90% of the population is politically inert. They become active only accidentally. When they are set into motion. But they are | 3404.823565 | 3447.74499 |

I gave her morphine every 30 minutes for an hour and a half, and still giving me touch with me. And so finally, I went ahead and called EMS to come to the ER so they can manage her pain. Mhmm. We took off service temporarily. I'll ask this, but they won't take a boat. So they went ahead and did search and then, of course, there was always also that. That she passed away then. So beyond hospital hospital hospital hospital. So we just said when she together. You know? So she's feel properly, all that good stuff. But Now it's 2 months ago now. You know? And she's good. But she's not bad. And we expect that I went after surgery less than a month. Which we all didn't expect her to live. Going on 3 months. Yeah. You know?

| SPEAKER_1 | So there were people on the subway car who were just, like, wishing he was being crazy. We you know? Like, they're, like, but at at that time, whenever they were getting the, testimonials from people who saw what happened or whatever, They didn't know that the guy was dead.

| SPEAKER_0 | Jelly Roll's speech reflecting on winning best new artist at 39 as proof of hard work in overcome all obstacles. Taps into the familiar cultural narrative, the into a familiar cultural narrative. A bill the belief that feels inspiring, even empowering. But it oversimplifies the complex realities of privilege to systemic barriers and and personal struggle struggle, reducing achievement to individual perseverance, while overlooking the bright of broader forces to shape, broader forces shaping our lives. My own story offers a different perspective on this idea. At 32, I spent much of my life life grappling with societal expectations placed on women, pressures to derive value Either either from adhering to traditional roles as caretakers or from confirm Jesus. Or from conforming to beauty standards. For a long time, I internalized as messages, believing that by fitting into the latter, I could claim the valid opportunities that seemed to surround me in images everywhere. I thought saw it worth by modifying my parents, meeting the world's demands on its And for a while, I found recognition, but it came at the cost of my ability to be able to be recognized by my thoughts, my voice, and my mind. And you're very smart. I was reduced to a role a surface. I was reduced to an, an image, a a product to be consumed as men's entertainment. An idea thought up by man who pro profited immensely off the sexual objectification of women. And men's unnatural and ingrained domination seeking sickness. Living in a society shaped by patriarchal norms, Well, that my choices, especially as a woman, navigating spaces that objectify the the female body came with a stigma and judgment. My value was reduced to how I looked. My and my ideas potential on humanity were often disregarded. Those judgments didn't shaping my opportunities and narrowing my path. Even as I wake up to this reality, as I woke up to this reality, my past was used against me and still is reinforcing the belief reinforcing the belief that I am somehow less than. The idea that success is simply about effort ignores how uneven the playing field is. How do you how do you rise above systemic oppression when your identity is policed? Your labor under valued, and humanity dismissed? Class, race, gender, and countless other constructs don't just determine where we start, but also define the limits on what society allows us to achieve. The myth of hard work as the way to freedom and equality distracts from these dominant realities. Making inequality, despair, and immobility seem like a personal failure. And of a structural one with societal answers. Even after rejecting the commodification of my body and working towards unlearning the idea of the patriarchal world we live in, found that the barriers didn't disappear. System or hadn't disappeared. Living in a system that prioritizes profit over people leaves little space for personal growth or meaningful connection. Freedom, or liberty. Work become survival. Stripped of dignity and fulfillment. We those at the top profit from the exploitation of the vast majority of people. For example, For example, I know I I'm in school. I don't know. But I don't know why I said example, is that for women, especially those with some of the lower classes or impoverished backgrounds. The idea of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps is one of the the starkest examples | 75.36050009727478 | 298.5505000972748 |
| SPEAKER_1 | of how we're tricked into working against our best interests. Despite that, that's not how despite that that's not how boots work. Maybe it would help if the powerful and wealthy also got off our backs. A Jelly Roll story is moving, and his achievements are worth celebrating. That's a wait. Wait. And it but there's an abundance of anecdotal stories told from people with a microphone in a platform that boiled down to those success is proof that anyone can make it through hard work. It's not realistic and actively does harm. It upholds the myth of self made of the self made individual while ignoring the invisible systems of privilege and power that determine who gets ahead and who is left behind. These narratives, even if well intentioned, reinforce the idea that inequality and suffering is personal failing rather than a societal one. Jelly Roll is but one person. The sheer improbability of his achievement becomes apparent when we consider in the US where 11.1 of the population over 36,000,000 people live below the poverty line. Systemic barriers make upward mobility almost impossible. For the majority of people living in poverty or not so well off, the idea that hard work can alone lead to a breakthrough is under mind by limited access to quality education. And opportunity. Jelly Roll is but 0.0000-003% of the population. And 11.1% you're saying can just make it if they try. Like, so I was just saying can make it if they try. Wait. Wait. For the majority of living in poverty are not so well off the idea of how we're at Kalancan can lead to a breakthrough is undermined by limited access to quality education, opportunity, and health care, and other criticalness necessities. But he's just want but one person in the world Or there's even more pronounced globally. We're 1,100,000,000 people or 3.6 percent of the population live in extreme poverty, struggling to meet basic needs like food and shelter. Of course, these are imperialist realities of imposed upon them. Can these people just work hard and change their situations? These figures challenge the notion that success stories I've like jelly rolls are applicable for the average person. Not as yet. If each individual in the US represents 0.0000 3% of the population, the chances of achieving national recognition in any field are but vanishingly small on a global scale where one person accounts for an even tinier fraction. These odds become nearly impossible to grasp. While individual success stories are often celebrated as proof that anyone can overcome hardship, They obscure the reality that systemic inequalities make such outcomes the exception, not the rule of these these numbers illustrate the what is often presented as an inspiring possibility is for the vast majority of people, an unreachable aspiration shaped by the forces far beyond their control. What we need isn't more stories about overcoming systemic barriers, but a reckoning with why those barriers exist in the first place. Uh-huh. Want to live in a world where success doesn't require navigating or surviving oppression, but where the systems that create those struggles are dismantled. A world where our worth isn't tied to how well we perform, within a broken system, how productive we are for the profits of the owner class. But where every person's potential and dignity are honored by Default. And so that world exists stories like jelly rolls served blessed inspiration and more as a tool to instill false a false sense of awareness and the fairy and fairy tale thinking in us. I believe it's just one of the narratives that that we must that must be questioned because it's the only way we only way to make progress in the work and in the work we have to do. | 264.8223650455475 | 525.5805000455475 |
| SPEAKER_02 | How do you feel about injecting somebody's face with botox? do you think you would be comfortable with doing that? like he does that because his dad instilled that kind of thinking in him. because his dad didn't want to be seen... like, didn't want to be like... a lot of black people have | 543.8375699520111 | 553.4975699520111 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Internalized racism. they do. they self -police themselves because they don't want to be like the other black people who aren't assimilating to the dominant culture, to the white culture, to be accepted. it's respectability politics. and his dad very much played that. i mean, i was like, brian, your dad never even let y 'all know his family. | 553.4975700378418 | 573.4775700378418 |
| SPEAKER_01 | Oh, really? and his mom? like she was purposefully, like, um, saying these things, but let it be known that she didn't disagree, she didn't agree with this kind of, | 603.8375699520111 | 633.7775699520112 |

| SPEAKER_1 | that. Okay with this? What you're gonna see is conservative parties lean more anti LGBTQ, while liberal parties tend to lean more pro. It has nothing to do with the economic side of it. Okay. Well, | 261.578551 | 281.148551 |

| SPEAKER_4 | the | 853.988698 | 854.068698 |
| SPEAKER_3 | word of sex. So | 854.068698 | 855.0286980000001 |
| SPEAKER_6 | if I look up sex, she said they're the same thing. So if I look up sex, the definition of sex will be the behavioral cultural psychological traits typically associated with one sex. That's what the definition of sex will be. | 855.0286980000001 | 864.628698 |

| SPEAKER_4 | sex | 895.118698 | 895.198698 |
| SPEAKER_3 | That's the wrong definition, though. | 895.438698 | 896.588698 |

| SPEAKER_5 | constraint. What is written down. | 864.8946355 | 914.758698 |
| SPEAKER_6 | The behavioral, cultural, or psych or psychological traits typically associated with 1 sex. When I misconstrued everyone's saying you're not getting proper definition. That's correct.

| SPEAKER_3 | something else? | 1120.918668 | 1121.4986979999999 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Not until you conceive to the fact that gender and sex are 2 different things with 2 different meanings. Once you concede, I'll let you move the conversation somewhere else. | 1074.6046355 | 1131.798698 |
| SPEAKER_4 | If you can't, you're | 1086.4245855 | 1134.225298 |
| SPEAKER_3 | all gonna be dead. | 1134.225298 | 1135.688698 |
| SPEAKER_6 | We know that sex and gender are two Different Now what's beautiful about this now new understanding | 1091.7445955 | 1145.118698 |
| SPEAKER_5 | is we can look at the definition of sex, which is behavioral, | 1098.2345854999999 | 1148.428698 |
| SPEAKER_6 | cultural, or psychological traits. | 1101.7646355 | 1150.958698 |
| SPEAKER_5 | These would all be societal things. That can change. Behavioral traits can change. Cultural traits can change, and psychological traits can change. We can look at the next word, switches Typically, associated So I love that it says typically because what that tells us is that when I | 1103.8246354999999 | 1167.573698 |

| SPEAKER_5 | You moved topics because you couldn't handle the conversation. We can go back to it We'll just be back to the same thing, You wanted to move topics. The person who pivots to a new topic is not the person who | 1132.3446354999999 | 1190.768698 |
| SPEAKER_6 | Fun fact. | 1144.1546355 | 1192.608698 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Okay. So | 1146.5146355 | 1147.7746355 |

| SPEAKER_5 | We'll prove I'll prove to you that you're wrong about everything else if you wanna go there. But you need to stop pivoting. | 1155.7746355 | 1207.778698 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Okay? | 1161.7346355 | 1162.2346355 |
| SPEAKER_6 | You wanna talk to the comments, we'll turn the comments off. I don't care about the comments. | 1162.8846755 | 1214.298698 |

| SPEAKER_4 | Yeah. | 1172.8546355 | 1173.3546355 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Great. | 1173.7046355 | 1174.2046355 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Now, again, we know that sex and gender are two different things. We know that is typically related to social things such as behavioral cultural, or psychological traits. And we know that gender is only typically associated with specific sexes. What does the word typically mean? Usually, Okay. So does that mean there's an atypical? Yes or no? | 1174.9446355 | 1242.608698 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Yes. | 1197.2347355 | 1197.7347355 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Great. | 1245.328698 | 1245.828698 |
| SPEAKER_5 | So trans people would be the atypical. They are have they have these behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits, but they're not associated with that sex. They're associated with the other sex. | 1198.9346355 | 1255.798698 |
| SPEAKER_3 | And that that that that's where that's where this comes in. That's a mental disorder. That's not that's not a real thing that's happening to them. That's a good | 1208.7446355 | 1261.948698 |
| SPEAKER_6 | that's a mental disorder. | 1261.988698 | 1263.7286980000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | And them having that type of those problems in their mind, and there's plenty of | 1217.1846355 | 1269.938698 |

| SPEAKER_3 | Yeah. And it's literally called gender dysphoria, buddy. | 1255.6646355 | 1305.538698 |
| SPEAKER_6 | So being trans does not mean you have gender dysphoria. | 1258.8246354999999 | 1308.9387980000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Yes. It does. | 1262.4445355 | 1310.778698 |

| SPEAKER_5 | Oh, okay. So you don't want to. So you don't wanna read the part where they say under genitals for you. That only some people who are transgender will experience gender | 1278.1745354999998 | 1332.6787980000001 |
| SPEAKER_4 | dysphoria. | 1332.6787980000001 | 1333.068698 |
| SPEAKER_3 | I mean, that | 1288.3747354999998 | 1336.518698 |

| SPEAKER_3 | How do you think there's confusion there? I agree. This people who created the diagnosis, | 1343.688698 | 1348.018698 |
| SPEAKER_6 | we're | 1348.018698 | 1348.2585980000001 |

| SPEAKER_5 | People who created the diagnosis of gender dysphoria have literally said that not all trans people have it. So if you wanna concede to this, if you wanna keep going | 1303.0446355 | 1357.788698 |
| SPEAKER_4 | down this path, | 1357.788698 | 1358.608698 |

| SPEAKER_2 | the is that is that whether or not it's a positive You see anybody who says just have to try hard and don't make it is the same it's it's the same thing. As, like, believing in the American dream. Well, no. Some people are trying really hard, and they can't make they can't make the most basic, like, they can't meet the most their most, like, basic human beings.

| SPEAKER_2 | So then personal efforts is not the question here. It's the weight on people's necks and backs that are put on them on purpose in order for some people to benefit. That is the problem. It's not people's effort. People are putting an effort. Nobody said that that's a bad thing. But there has to be some sort of, like it's not just the person individual person's responsibility or like, ability to do anything. Doesn't matter how trap met people try. They'll never they never get out of where they are. So | 170.33727955818176 | 205.15727955818178 |

| SPEAKER_2 | that's how the system is designed. So it doesn't matter how hard people try. And I think I think personal effort does make a difference. The okay. Did you hear me? Yeah. I did hear you. Do you disagree with the fact that no. I don't have poverty. That do you disagree with me that the people in poverty are in poverty because of the wealth that some people have? No. I do not disagree with that. Okay | 190.84134197235107 | 216.23134197235106 |

| SPEAKER_0 | To just be more productive when they don't even fucking raise our wages. That's my take on it. I'm sorry. I don't think that everybody can make it because, like, you agree with me saying that there has to be these people in publishing order for them to be equal and to for the people to be wealthy.

| SPEAKER_1 | And | 742.0944764999999 | 742.5144765 |
| SPEAKER_2 | just an interesting you know, as we started on this podcast, I'm just observing how people are largely I don't know what the impact is. I, again, She did | 742.9144765 | 799.6485339999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | this this this weekly During his first presidency, She just goes I mean, I don't know if this is kinda weird that, like, She got that. There was a she needed to stop the list after Biden was president. I looked like things were way back over wet. To a normal from a normal quote unquote whatever. | 799.6485339999999 | 826.358534 |
| SPEAKER_0 | But now she started it She's on week 5 already. She started it now again. She brought I mean, | 863.9690459000001 | 884.339046 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I think it's like I | 885.6890440000001 | 886.729046 |
| SPEAKER_0 | think it | 886.729046 | 887.369045 |
| SPEAKER_1 | literally is | 887.369045 | 888.089046 |
| SPEAKER_0 | just what she's covering is, like, not normal. Not that not that normal is okay. Either though. Like, because she is she lists she talks about the things that went on that don't normally happen, whether or not they're good or bad to happen the way that they do. The fact that it's, like, 20 times worse when, like, the way he's doing hired all of his fucking family members and put them in positions and, | 888.3290460000001 | 912.359046 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Government. And, he gave his he he gave all of his or, like, gave them the whatever it's called, the | 865.6349835000001 | 923.229046 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Pass them | 877.1249815000001 | 925.149046 |
| SPEAKER_1 | down? | 925.149046 | 925.4490460000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Not passed him down, but gave the, the the responsibility. I don't know. I forgot what it's called right now. Foxy or whatever? No. Just like his business | 878.3149875 | 933.879046 |
| SPEAKER_3 | is. | 933.9390520000001 | 934.0390460000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | His business or, like, just his Trump businesses or whatever. He gave all of that. Because you can't have business that being a president. Apparently. Like, not like that. Mhmm. Especially, like, the businesses or his Mar a Lago's. I don't even know how that's business. I guess it's just because it's their golf course. I think that's his main one, but it's because | 886.7449835000001 | 954.4290500000001 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Right. You see how the spokes just, like, flowing down? Yeah. | 908.7149835 | 911.6049835 |

| SPEAKER_2 | He gave it all he gave the fund the responsibility or the the position the president I don't know what it's called. CEO | 924.5049835000001 | 932.5749835 |
| SPEAKER_1 | ship? | 980.409046 | 980.729046 |

| SPEAKER_2 | a crime? | 2217.818092 | 2218.058092 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Say what? Say what? | 2268.0717710000004 | 2272.1917710000002 |
| SPEAKER_2 | He said if they if they get raped, then they're not choosing to have a to have sex. So, therefore, right? Is that what you said? Our | 2281.4177085 | 2336.911771 |
| SPEAKER_1 | demons. We | 2337.1317710000003 | 2338.161771 |
| SPEAKER_3 | You you said that even if they're raped, they were sexually assaulted. They should still | 2291.2677085 | 2342.141771 |
| SPEAKER_2 | But his, his the inconsistency is that he was blaming women who choose to have sex, so they should choose, the so they should have to deal with the consequences. What about in the case of rape where they're not choosing to have sex? Should they also have to deal with the consequences? Consequences? Because that's yeah. Nothing. Like, | 2298.5177085 | 2391.891771 |
| SPEAKER_1 | doesn't know what's going on. There's no knowing for that thing. | 2345.8577035000003 | 2396.291771 |
| SPEAKER_2 | What do you mean just a fucking act with your husband or something? You got some | 2353.9177085 | 2404.4917710000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | hit on accident. | 2404.4917710000004 | 2405.3117610000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Cooking tops like | 2358.7376985 | 2406.751771 |
| SPEAKER_2 | that? Yeah. Must have been, | 2406.751771 | 2407.951771 |
| SPEAKER_3 | like, fucking damaged | 2407.951771 | 2409.171761 |
| SPEAKER_4 | by us. We get some shit. Like | 2409.231771 | 2411.891771 |
| SPEAKER_2 | No. Or | 2412.291771 | 2412.851771 |
| SPEAKER_4 | For for for | 2413.0917710000003 | 2413.5717710000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | someone | 2413.5717710000004 | 2414.0517710000004 |
| SPEAKER_4 | to | 2414.0517710000004 | 2414.2217710000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | that fucking kind of mentality | 2367.1677085 | 2415.661771 |
| SPEAKER_2 | He's also very young and probably just watching Andrew Tate. That's probably what it could be. I mean, it doesn't have to be, like, a reason for people to to treat women like that. What do you mean? It have to be because | 2416.141771 | 2431.9117810000002 |
| SPEAKER_4 | a | 2431.9117810000002 | 2431.991781 |
| SPEAKER_1 | woman did something that | 2431.991781 | 2433.2717810000004 |
| SPEAKER_4 | garnered | 2433.2717810000004 | 2433.5917710000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | it? | 2433.5917710000003 | 2434.0917710000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | There's plenty of, | 2390.1076985000004 | 2438.3617710000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | like, | 2438.3617710000003 | 2438.8617710000003 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I mean, reasons why people end up like | 2392.4376985000004 | 2442.0617610000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that. I mean, just look at the way just look at grand theft auto or these, like, these things that influence people to act like that. That could be definitely be the reason or how violence is part so much of part of, like, masculinity and the way it's, like, shown that, like, to everyone. It's like you're | 2442.0617610000004 | 2464.231771 |

| SPEAKER_2 | My | 2427.8877085000004 | 2428.0477085 |
| SPEAKER_1 | tone was not towards you. It was just my | 2475.3417710000003 | 2478.001771 |
| SPEAKER_4 | my | 2431.4727085000004 | 2431.9727085000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | annoyance of that kind of stuff, like, | 2432.2177085000003 | 2481.931771 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Oh, there's my jacket. Isn't it cold cold outside? | 2440.8077085000004 | 2491.8017710000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's it's That's kind of a weird argument, but I think it's | 2445.5977185 | 2538.286771 |
| SPEAKER_5 | very | 2538.286771 | 2538.3617710000003 |
| SPEAKER_4 | now. | 2538.6917710000002 | 2539.0517710000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I mean, I have to think about it more. Is is there a different argument that's for sure. Yeah. But, | 2494.4577085 | 2546.2617710000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | yeah, | 2546.2617710000004 | 2546.7617710000004 |
| SPEAKER_1 | I | 2501.1877085 | 2501.3477085000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | feel like there could be, like, a | 2548.641771 | 2550.501771 |
| SPEAKER_1 | something to be like, well, that's not comparable for just for that reason. But I mean, it's not These kids not gonna have the thing to say back to it. That's for sure. | 2504.5777085000004 | 2560.8217710000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Some sort of decision or action. | 2528.3777085 | 2532.2977085 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Persons. 32.9 deaths. So every every 100 That's that's not true. | 2581.1577085000004 | 2639.3217910000003 |
| SPEAKER_1 | What? | 2592.2877085 | 2592.7877085 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So so you think the CDC is lying with us? | 2640.541791 | 2643.3817710000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Absolutely. | 2597.0176885 | 2597.5176885 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Why? Why would | 2600.3177085 | 2652.041771 |
| SPEAKER_1 | maybe maybe because | 2605.4677085000003 | 2654.061751 |
| SPEAKER_2 | or | 2656.1217410000004 | 2656.351771 |
| SPEAKER_1 | my god. That's stupidest part. I was | 2609.2977085 | 2657.791791 |
| SPEAKER_2 | just basically I I really wanted to | 2657.791791 | 2659.6317710000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | make sure that before we continue I was talking to somebody who is smart, and I guess I | 2659.6317710000003 | 2663.481771 |
| SPEAKER_4 | wasn't. Uh-huh. | 2663.481771 | 2619.8577085 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Smart people don't have time to multiple things you multiple of your own logic. You backpedaled on your own logic. You don't believe the CDC's number on maternal mortality even though they're the ones who track that shit. You believe that you value potential over somebody who's currently selling? More logic. | 2667.211771 | 2756.291771 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Did you find here why you lost | 2710.2177085000003 | 2759.0517710000004 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Why do the people who don't have consensual sex lose control of their body? | 2723.0877085 | 2773.9217710000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | Because there's a such thing as adoption. | 2728.4377285 | 2777.5917710000003 |
| SPEAKER_3 | Answer. That's not an answer. Your claim is that the reason they can't have an abortion is they spread their | 2738.4476785 | 2791.6584310000003 |
| SPEAKER_5 | legs | 2791.6584310000003 | 2791.961771 |
| SPEAKER_3 | So when someone doesn't spread their legs, it would | 2745.3077085000004 | 2795.041771 |
| SPEAKER_0 | that that | 2749.5877485 | 2797.581771 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It's like | 2752.3277085 | 2800.601771 |
| SPEAKER_6 | I don't know. Whatever. I'm talking | 2801.8617710000003 | 2822.3817710000003 |
| SPEAKER_7 | I'll | 2776.7577085000003 | 2776.9977085 |
| SPEAKER_6 | destroy you. | 2824.291771 | 2825.6717710000003 |
| SPEAKER_4 | Double down on his own fucking stupidity. Hold | 2779.0076785 | 2782.7677085000005 |
| SPEAKER_5 | on. I'm talking to the same person that thinks a naturally born male It can be a female. That that that so I'm talking about No. That's that's | 2830.201771 | 2840.0117710000004 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That was so fucking decent. Like, that's so different, didn't you? Saying | 2792.9577085 | 2842.891771 |
| SPEAKER_3 | male and female on this list. | 2842.891771 | 2844.6717310000004 |

I guess they're called properties. Based on 1 or 2 properties, the Other properties it contains may be different. Or include more than others. For example, if we had an end to The property would be the, sorry, the type of property would be would be person, and based on that being person, it would have other properties such as Position or role, And It would list under those. | 0 | 74.36 |

| SPEAKER_2 | The police invoke these laws to conceal their identities and use of force cases claiming they were a victim in the altercation. And when the police aren't busy avoiding responsibility and accountable the supreme court made the common police mission statement to protect and serve a mere PR slogan. Ruling in Warren v District of Columbia the court determined that police have no constitutional duty to protect even in emergencies. Guarding with me and the police have to do so, then every public official would also have to do the same. An illogical and stupid train of thought. Already in this video, I've mentioned the instances of America police needlessly murdering citizens at the slightest provocation. Or lack of a better term, It should be no surprise then that American police kill more than any other so called developed nations law enforcement. Between 2014 and 2016 alone, over 1,000 police killings were reported annually with black Americans disproportionately represented among the victims. So much so in fact that getting killed while police is a leading cause of death for young black men in America. This isn't an aberration as I talked about in my 13 50 percent video here. Black people are treated like an occupied colonial population within the US, Just to give you an idea of how bad the problem is in a single statistic, black teenagers are 21 times more likely than their white peers to be killed by police. Remind me again, who has a target on their back? It's definitely not the cops. These killings occur within the broader context of mass incarceration I also touched on in the previous video mentioned. So I'll just highlight some statistics. The United States currently imprisons 2,000,000 people, more people than in any other country and 25% of the world's incarcerated population despite only being 4% of the global population. The US across China with well over 4 times the population. Incarcerates approximately 1.69000000 people. This means China's incarceration rate is a 119,400,000. Russia, another US enemy accused of unconstrained of authoritarianism, holds 433,000. Russia's incarceration rate is 450 per 100,000. Speaking of prisons, policies like war on drugs have been central to the explosion of America's incarcerated population. Between 19 85 and 2000, sentences for nonviolent to drug offenses nearly doubled, contributing to a 66% increase in the state prison population. Likewise, a boom for private prisons. By 2,000. Over 1,000,000 black adolescents had a parent in prison. All of this sounds like institutional racism. Right? Well, that's because it is. It's the other major defining feature of American policing. Black and brown communities are over policed and subjected to invasive often violent encounters, something else I've covered in-depth in my 13 50 percent video. There's sadly a lot of overlap that just tends to happen with intersectional problems. Since you see more detail on that video, I want to highlight something I didn't mention there. Even those of higher class positions, prominent figures like Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Junior, have been a victim of this insanity. The man was arrested in his own home after being reported by a neighbor as a burglar. Despite proving via his driver's license that it was his house. The cops didn't believe him because he was black. But what about to call the diverse police forces? Do they do better? The short answer is no. Departments with diverse personnel continue to enforce policies like stop and risk and aggressive drug enforcement. Which disproportionately targets the online communities. This proves or at least strongly supports the idea that there's a broader systemic ideology that views poor and otherwise marginalized populations as threats to be controlled instead of people to be helped. Let's talk about the non lethal corruption the police get up to. Legal theft by police, aka civil asset forfeiture, is a predatory state sponsored practice that is pretty popular within US law enforcement. The US publishes reports about all the stuff, and I took look at just 2 categories for the most recent data available, which is last year. Here it is. Police seized 76,800 items valued at $6,000,000,000 with an additional $106,000,000 in forfeited property. This brought the total value of seized and forfeited property to over $6,100,000,000 It's almost certainly worse than this, but even this is a staggering amount. These assets are often taken from individuals who are never charged with a crime and disproportionate affect working class and marginalized communities. Yes. There's the occasional drug kingpin bust or whatever, but these are rare. In many cases, deceased property includes cash or vehicles and even homes, forcing people into expensive legal battles to reclaim their belongings. Though legal theft isn't the only crime the police get up to. In the Los Angeles County, they've taken organized police crime to the next level. Gangs. I mean gang units, Southern groups of police societies specifically deal with gang violence. I mean, gangs of police that have a structure and purpose similar to those on the outside of the law, so to speak. LA County has at least 10 known deputy gangs with names like the reefers, regulators, jump out boys, executioners, benditos, and the Vikings, incredibly stupid names. These gangs have operated within the sheriff's department for at least 50 years. These gangs enforce illegal arrest quotas, tally it against officers who refuse to comply celebrate violence they commit with tattoos and parties. For example, deputy Miguel Vega fatally shot 18 year old Andres Huerta while allegedly attempting to impress the executioners and earn their signature sculpt and tattoo. Since 2010, so called misconduct in any wild crime linked to these deputy gangs have Los Angeles over $21,000,000 in settlements. Whistleblowers have testified about the gang's extensive influence, oversight bodies report continued failures to investigate discipline or fire members. | 0 | 378.24396249999995 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So | 332.56989999999996 | 332.7299999999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | 2 missed contact mostly, unfortunately, is, of course, another pervasive issue in policing, victims are more often than not under 18. Not that I make it okay had they been over 18, but I'm making a point. Between 2005 and 2,007 alone, 548 officers were arrested for sex related crime. Crimes, with 56% of these offenses occurring on duty. So basically, citizens paid cops to kids, 3 7% of the victims were between 13 15 years old. And 12% for 12 or younger. According to investigation by the Washington Post, per 2,005, according to 1,000 8 high officers in charge of crimes involving child sexual abuse. Many avoid punishment, due to box investigations, reduced charges, and leniently yield. Domestic violence among police officers also reflects the culture of conflict aggression. Service police officers themselves show that 40% of them admitted to physically abusive their spouses in the past year at the time of survey. 3% in all events this year violence | 380.0240624999999 | 434.4240625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that | 434.4240625 | 434.6640625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | is. | 434.6640625 | 435.1640625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | These | 435.5440624999999 | 435.70406249999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | race particularly in drug and weapons cases. Where is more people in LA? Officers flying to drugs on 2 individuals in the profession leading to wrongful convictions and prison sentences. Over 200 convictions were overturned as a result of the scandal. So how do these assholes keep getting away with murder? This does to the major factors, but these by no means 27 by government officials acting in good faith on civil liability. In 1982, the US Supreme Court expanded the scope of the doctrine by removing the subjective good faith requirement arguing that litigating an officer's intentions created excessive costs on distracted officers from their duties. How is never really explained. There's just a vibe, I guess. This objective standard allows officers to avoid liability unless their actions violate clearly established constitutional rights. Term defined so narrowly that the courts often grant immunity even in cases of severe misconduct. For instance, a social worker accused of sexual harassment was granted immunity because I swear I'm not making this up, the court reason that the plaintiff's 14th amendment right to be free from sexual harassment by a social worker worker was not clearly established at the time of the alleged misconduct. This is in spite of the fact that sexual harassment was also against the department's internal policy and the law. These doctrines impact this staggering Between 1982 and 2018, supreme court upheld qualified immunity in 28 of 30 cases, reversing most lower court decisions that denied immunity. As a result, fewer than 1% of victims pursue lawsuits since early dismissal is all but guaranteed. Even in the rare cases they reach the supreme court, victims rarely succeed with decisions consistently favoring officers and their so called adjutant. Courts on this matter at least are the biggest impediment to meaningful change in the legal system. While qualified immunity provides a legal cover for misconduct, the blue wall of silence, as it's known, ensures cultural protection by discouraging officer from snitching on their fellow officers. They frequently describe their relationships as familial, emphasizing loyalty to their brothers in blue, again, more cringe. Not sure I could do a better job explaining that than some graffiti at the NYPD Academy. The commissioner is the mayor's puppet. Mayor doesn't care for us. Media puts us down and the public hates us. All we have is each other. Stick together. | 435.70406249999996 | 614.9140625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | That | 568.6499999999999 | 568.81 |
| SPEAKER_2 | loyalty is not just expected amongst beers, but also directed upwards. With officers refraining from actions that could harm their superiors' interests. This, of course, strengthens the culture of silence. Creates a feedback loop where misconduct is protected, normalized, and perpetuated. The consequences of breaking the silence are severe and far reaching. Whistleblowers face ostracism, harassment, and retaliation, including undesirable assignments, fabricated misconduct charges, stalled career progression or even violence, physical and psychological intimidation, substance property damage, and stress induced health issues further discourage officers from speaking out In some cases, whistles face the prospect of back being withdrawn in life threatening situations even. | 616.1040625 | 654.1640625 |
| SPEAKER_3 | It's like killing Susan. Everyone's guilty. | 608.2299999999998 | 659.4740625 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Okay. So what's the alternative? Just get rid of the police? Well, as they're currently constructed, yeah, a gradual dissolution of the current structure required. Public safety, as it is traditionally understood, narrowly focuses on preventing violent crime and property damage, primarily through police, a liberal approach. This framework ignores the broader and more complete idea of safety, includes access to safe housing, food, health care, and education. People living on the streets, scavenging for food, or suffering from untreated illnesses need direct help aimed at their core issues, not a gun in their face. | 616.1799999999998 | 695.3040624999999 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Eliminating the structures that perpetuate our serial logic, which is a huge problem in and of itself. Defending the police should be a goal of this process, but not the ultimate goal. Instead, resources must be redirected towards creating alternative systems that prioritize equity, empathy, and the provision of basic needs. A solid housing plan government mandated debt management and elimination, Mental health, support, and employment will go far further than anything else the US has tried. And will cost a fraction as much. A good start for your reading journey is when you Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander. Our Person's Ops Elite by Angela Davis, Who do you serve? Who do you protect?

| SPEAKER_2 | an an integration app, in the Omni app ecosystem. And I did it by running the the API, our own custom API. In AWS is 2 virtual machines. But if you're just starting out and want to see what we can create, how best to Build something up. It might be a little bit to overview, to run And so today, I'm going to show you how you run the API locally. On your computer. And then, make it available on the Internet from your local | 13.025937499999998 | 101.86999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | computer. And | 101.86999 | 56.035937499999996 |
| SPEAKER_2 | So you can set up, an only integration app that we did in this video. But without all the overhead of creating a EC 2 instance on AWS. So to start, we moved the API we have before? So all this those stuff. And then, basically, creating importing different packages, creating an app instance for passive PI, and then we only have one endpoint the slash webhook. By the way, if you have not watched this video, I would highly recommend that. Checking it out because it's been a bit a bit | 56.51592750000001 | 154.17 |
| SPEAKER_1 | better. | 154.17 | 154.37 |

| SPEAKER_0 | 1, 2, 7, to 0 to is a local host. You cannot access it from the the Internet. You cannot configure your an app in Omni that will actually work with that. However, and there is a solution called You can download it to Mac, Windows, Linux, create So small, like, line have with 1 or And we're going to connect | 189.61928497 | 238.06928499999998 |
| SPEAKER_2 | In our local instance. Of the API today. I would like to sound a bit too much, | 190.0152225 | 244.50928499999998 |
| SPEAKER_1 | but | 244.50928499999998 | 245.00928499999998 |

The important stuff to remember is that bank on port South. Metal because we we needed to use it. We Now after it's sold, and work, we also need to create an So you will go to found And then And then what's your token? And then all you need to run is We are | 198.21522249999998 | 331.679285 |

| SPEAKER_1 | I was like, it's shit doesn't work at first. Like, because it was I don't I still don't really get it, honestly. But yep. Let's see. Like, I said something about, about you having a Jeep Wrangler. Because there's an app for, like, helping you figure out, like, what, like, troubleshooting, like, your car. Mhmm. So | 121.61406445503235 | 181.56406445503234 |
| SPEAKER_1 | should try or whatever. I just said that, I said only thing I said was that my fiance has a 2004 Jeep Wrangler X. Then I said something about misfires. Or he's having issues with misfiring and a drop in gas mileage. And then so this is the what it says. Like, based on that conversation, what that I had with myself for, like, a second. So just, like, basic things, but, I mean, I just said the same thing that we've been just I just wanted | 145.04000210762024 | 225.84407460762023 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you | 181.56406450271606 | 181.7240645027161 |
| SPEAKER_1 | just, like, say whatever, like, we're talking to somebody about what's wrong with it. We'll listen and then Right. Tell you based on its car the car app, like, things | 181.72406458854675 | 191.57406458854675 |
| SPEAKER_2 | you | 191.57406449317932 | 191.85406449317932 |
| SPEAKER_2 | to see what it would do. The the problems that, like, I've had with it are all on that list. Because, like, I've had I've had problems with the fucking vacuum vacuum lines coming undone. They should trip me the fuck out. Like, that it only happened one technically, it's happened twice, but it only happened once when I was actually driving. But, there's, like, 3 vacuum lines on the side of the engine. And fucking, one of them came disconnected and, like, I had, like, 0 fucking power, like, fucking max speed of a total fuck a whopping 30 miles an hour. And fucking it sounded like there's, like, a fucking vortex up in my fucking hood. And I'm, like, what the fuck is that? So I pulled over This is leaving Justin's one night and fucking I pulled over at the ATB, and fucking, like, just popped the hood and and, like, left the engine running. It was just, like, fucking, like, hardcore. Like, what the fuck is it? Like, is this shit about the fucking blow up? And then, like, What the hell? I was I was like When did that happen? I was like, where the fuck like, the fan doesn't produce that much fucking air. Like, what the fuck is going on? When did that | 225.84407448768616 | 296.4340644876862 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Oh, okay. But this is recently, or you didn't tell me about this. It | 256.61000204086304 | 306.82406454086305 |
| SPEAKER_1 | And that could be due to that was part of the was whatever was on the list just now, | 281.59002208709717 | 333.27226458709714 |
| SPEAKER_0 | On | 286.46002197265625 | 286.70000197265625 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So weird. | 291.04000210762024 | 339.05406460762026 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. Because, like, the vacuum is developed from your intake stroke or whatever. So, like, your intake manifold has typically a couple of vacuum lines attached to it for, like, your brake booster. Because like your brakes aren't just like a a mechanical linkage or whatever. You are when you press the brake pedal, it actually it essentially gets magnified by the fucking brake booster Mhmm. Or boosted. | 292.6400020122528 | 321.9200020122528 |
| SPEAKER_1 | where did that when did this happen to | 296.59406447410583 | 298.22408447410584 |
| SPEAKER_2 | me? This was like one night that I just dropped off to Justin's, like, when after dropping off dropping you off at work. | 298.2240846157074 | 303.9040646157074 |
| SPEAKER_2 | was, like, within the past month. Because, like, whenever I whenever I've fucking, like, looked at it, like, pinpointing where the sound was coming from, which wasn't really that difficult. I was just kinda like, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. For too long? Mhmm. And, I I noticed that, like, one of the fucking hose connections was just, like, not connected whatsoever. So I was just like, Oh, | 306.8240644931793 | 280.95000199317934 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And, it uses vacuum power to do that why, like, when you press the brakes, when, the car is off, you can only press it so far without having to, like, fucking jam it down. But if you If you have a foot on the brake and then you turn the car on, it'll fucking it'll go down a lot further. | 322.9900019168854 | 388.84404441688537 |
| SPEAKER_2 | though? | 333.2722644805908 | 333.43406448059085 |
| SPEAKER_1 | that list? | 333.99406456947327 | 334.31406456947326 |
| SPEAKER_2 | On the, it said check the intake or or vacuum lines. | 334.31406450271606 | 338.33406450271605 |
| SPEAKER_1 | Okay. Great. | 341.98998188972473 | 390.4840643897247 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Yeah. The brake booster looks like a giant fucking, like like, 2 balls stacked stacked, like, top to top, but, like, on their side. | 354.6500220298767 | 411.0140645298767 |
| SPEAKER_1 | It looks like 2 balls. | 364.5199820995331 | 413.17406459953304 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Mhmm. | 369.4190845489502 | 369.9190845489502 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And it's, like, attached to the firewall right in front? In front of the driver's seat? | 369.5900020599365 | 421.0440645599365 |
| SPEAKER_1 | So, this thing also So | 378.2599720954895 | 381.0500020954895 |
| SPEAKER_0 | Like, | 382.04000210762024 | 382.54000210762024 |

| SPEAKER_2 | Okay. The vacuum pressure develop and, like, it that's how I don't know exactly how it works, but I know that that's kinda how it | 390.48406457901 | 397.97408457901 |
| SPEAKER_0 | works. | 398.19408440589905 | 398.69408440589905 |

I want to find a way out of this cycle with you, sending me this song, also makes me think that Something that's been affecting how we interact I know you've faced your own challenges, and I wonder if this song is also saying, it's not just about us. I'm dealing with my own battles too. | 96.49513 | 143.99513000000002 |
| SPEAKER_1 | happens between us. There's a lot more underneath the surface. I wanna be there for you as you work through that, just as I hope you'll be there for me as I do the same. What I'm hearing in this song is a mix of apology self awareness, and a sincere desire to change for both of us. I know you're overwhelmed, and this song feels like an expression of both the weight of our fight and your internal struggles. It's clear to me that you care deeply about us. But it's also clear that we've both been struggling. I feel the hurt from both of us in this, and I don't want it to keep repeating. To me, this song says, I see the cycle we're in. And I don't want this anymore. For either of us. I'm hurting. And I know my actions might be contributing to that pain. I wanna change. For myself, And for us, I'm ready to have that vulnerable conversation with you. I want us to both look at these patterns understand them, and figure out how to move forward together toward healthier ways of being with each other. | 96.3810675 | 207.52513 |
| SPEAKER_0 | You sent me breaking the habit, I sat with it for a while because I wanted to really understand what it might mean and what you were trying to say. I hear you. And I feel the weight behind this. It feels like the song carries a lot of layers, Pain. Frustration, and a desire for change. I don't take that lightly, and I want | 285.439359 | 306.019359 |
| SPEAKER_1 | hard. | 246.2052985 | 246.65529650000002 |
| SPEAKER_0 | And they speak to patterns that keep repeating. | 246.8152965 | 296.529359 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Patterns that I think we both felt stuck in. When it says | 250.2952965 | 302.009359 |
| SPEAKER_0 | One confused. And I hurt much more than any time before. Feel like they're coming from a place of deep pain. Maybe even loneliness. I know our fights have made it harder to connect, and I can only imagine how overwhelming that feels for you sometimes. If this is you asking for understanding, for patience, or even just for me to see what's going on inside you, want you to know that I'm listening. When the song says, I don't wanna be the one who battles always choose, I hear an urgency that I can't ignore. It feels like you're saying that something has to change because the way things are isn't sustainable. Maybe this fight or everything leading up to it feels like a turning point for you like you're ready to take steps to do things differently, Or maybe it's a way of telling me that we can't keep doing this without losing something important. I also hear that this might not just be about | 381.30607100000003 | 436.126071 |
| SPEAKER_2 | breaking the habit. It's and I can only imagine one who battles always choose I hear an urgency, but I can't leave. Or maybe it's a way of telling me that we can't keep doing this without losing something important. I also hear that this might not just be about us. A lot of this song feels like it's about fighting something internal. Whether it's pain, trauma, or emotional struggles that are affecting the way we show up for each other. If that's what this is, I want you to know that I'm trying to see that too. I can hear you saying, it's not just about you or us. I'm fighting something | 380.95200850000003 | 468.23606700000005 |
| SPEAKER_1 | within | 468.61607100000003 | 468.826071 |
| SPEAKER_0 | myself. | 468.826071 | 469.036071 |
| SPEAKER_2 | That makes sense to me. Even if I don't fully know how to help with it yet. What I'm taking away from this I think you might be saying, Is I see the cycle we're in. And I don't want this anymore. For either of us. I'm hurting, and I know my actions might be contributing to that pain. I want to change, for myself and for us. If this song is you trying to open a door for us to really talk, to look at the patterns we're in, and figure out how to move forward, I'm open to that. I don't want either of us to feel stuck, overwhelmed, or hurt in this way. I want to find a way for us to understand each other better and I want you to know that I see how much you care even if it's hard for us to show it sometimes. Thank you for sharing this with me. It means something. I hear you. And I care about what you're trying to say. Let's try to take this as a starting point to figure things | 423.1020085 | 524.766071 |
| SPEAKER_1 | out | 524.766071 | 525.066071 |
| SPEAKER_2 | Hey, Brian. I listened to Breaking the Habit by Lincoln Park. And I want to share what it means to me in the context of our relationship. I hope you can hear my heart in these words. 1, acknowledgment of cyclical destruction. I recognize that we've been stuck in a repetitive cycle of fights leave both of us feeling confused and exhausted. The frustration and introspection in the song mirror how I feel about our constant arguments. I understand that these conflicts aren't just hurting our relation. I want you to know that when you sent me Breaking the Habit, I really heard what you were trying to express. This song isn't just another piece of music. It's a heavy, emotional reflection of what's been happening between us. I understand that it's about recognizing patterns we've fallen into, the pain we've both been feeling, and possibly reaching a turning | 524.3720085 | 642.186091 |
| SPEAKER_1 | point. | 642.186091 | 642.376071 |
| SPEAKER_2 | When I hear the lyrics, especially the parts about not knowing what's worth fighting for and feeling the need to scream. I see them as your way of telling me that you're aware of the cycle we keep finding ourselves Then I recognize that you might be feeling confused exhausted, It's not just me feeling the weight of it. You are | 595.8819885 | 666.716071 |
| SPEAKER_1 | too. | 666.716071 | 667.1860710000001 |
| SPEAKER_2 | And this song shows me that you know it. The phrase I'll never be alright, so I'm breaking the habit tonight. Strikes me deeply. It comes across as you saying, I know something has to change, and I'm willing to make that happen. Whether it's anger, misunderstandings, or something you've been carrying for a long time, I can tell you're trying to say that you're done perpetuating these hurtful patterns. It feels like an admission that you've recognized your own contributions to the problem are ready or at least want to break free from them. Beyond that, the whole tone of breaking the habit, feels vulnerable. It speaks to someone who's hurting inside, someone who feels misunderstood, | 620.1319885 | 711.3960509999999 |
| SPEAKER_1 | lonely, | 665.3320085 | 665.6920085 |
| SPEAKER_2 | and unsure of how to communicate everything that's going on beneath the surface. By sending it to me, you might be asking for my understanding my patience, or at least my empathy. You might be saying, I know I've hurt, and I've been hurt. And I'm struggling to put all these feelings into words. I also sense that this could be a crucial moment for | 665.8520085 | 734.996071 |
| SPEAKER_1 | us. | 734.996071 | 735.376071 |
| SPEAKER_2 | The urgency in the song, the sense that continuing as we have is no longer acceptable, suggests that we're at a crossroads. It could mean you're reaching out and hoping I'll see that we need to address these issues head on. Perhaps this is a moment where we decide if we can move forward together more honest and compassionately, or if things remain as they are, and risk falling apart. Finally, I realize that what you're dealing with might not just be about our relationship. Breaking the habit also speaks to personal struggles. Internal battles that influence how you react and respond to me. By sharing this song, you could be letting me know that what seems like just another fight is actually connected to deeper feelings or pain you're trying to manage. Overall, sending me this song feels like you're showing me a piece of your Part. Admitting that you're sorry for how things have been acknowledging that you see the damage these patterns cause, and expressing a genuine desire to stop repeating them. It tells me you care about our situation that you're tired of the conflict, and that you want something different and healthier for both of us. I'm taking this as an opportunity for us to talk more openly and honestly. Let's consider what keeps triggering these conflicts. How we've both contributed, and what steps we can take. Either on our own Or together, to change our dynamics for the better. I want you to know that I hear | 688.6420085 | 827.306071 |
| SPEAKER_1 | you, | 827.306071 | 827.656071 |
| SPEAKER_2 | I see your effort in sharing this song. And I understand the depth what you're trying to say. | 780.6820084999999 | 833.416071 |
